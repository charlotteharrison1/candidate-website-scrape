The Conservative losses were on a historic scale — their 121 seats are more than 40 fewer than they managed in 1997 and 35 lower than their previous historic collapse in the early 1900s.\nBut the number of seats won has been used, by Labour politicians and by the media, to disguise the fundamental unpopularity of Labour’s threadbare policy platform and the authoritarianism of its leadership.\nThe “landslide” was won on hundreds of thousands fewer votes than under Corbyn’s leadership of the party in the 2019 general election, a result that was painted by the Labour right and the media as the “worst since 1935,” and more than three million fewer than under Corbyn in 2019. Turnout this month — the lowest since universal suffrage began — likewise reflected the disgust and disillusionment with the “two sides of the same coin” offering by the two main parties.\nOrdinary people are desperate for real change and Labour, despite using the word “change” as its slogan, was not offering it.\nBecause of Labour’s “more of the same” policies and the lack of public engagement — whether in hustings or otherwise — the granular impact on the Tories’ number of seats was driven by the rise of Reform UK.\nThe far-right party, which was given intense coverage by the media during the election campaign, took more than 15 per cent of the vote, compared with the Tories’ 24 per cent. It managed only five MPs, but of the 98 seats where it finished second, Labour won 89. In many of those, a unified right-wing vote would have been enough to prevent Labour from gaining the seat, enough to threaten Labour’s eventual majority.\nLabour’s win is not a turning of the page on Tory callousness and class war. It is often said that liberals are the handmaids to fascism and Labour’s refusal to offer socialist policies has empowered the far right.\nIn turn, the success of Reform was the main driver of a result that massively flattered Labour and hid the real political trends that were reflected in the vote tallies and low turnout.\nThe racist and reactionary currents underlying the rise of the right were on show in the campaign against me in Leicester East. In at least one WhatsApp group set up to attack my campaign, members of the group, whose identities originate from Oadby, freely told others to target specifically Muslim households and tell them they should vote against me because I had supported LGBTQ+ rights. Meanwhile, on social media, I was constantly the target of racist and misogynistic comments.\nThe success of the far right is likely to be used by the new government as an excuse or justification for a continuation of the Tories’ discriminatory and racist laws and practices — and as a basis for further attacks on our freedom to protest and resist them.\nBut at the same time, there were reasons for hope. The low turnout and the record votes for independent candidates and the Greens revealed the biggest ignored phenomenon of the general election: people are sick of being offered no real choice for socialism and fairness.\nMany stayed at home, but five independent MPs and four Greens — four times more than that party’s previous best — were sent to Parliament to be a voice for real change. Most of these wins were at the expense of Labour incumbents, including Jonathan Ashworth in Leicester South and Thangam Debbonaire in Bristol.\nIn 2019, Debonnaire beat the Greens’ Carla Denyer by almost 30,000 votes in Bristol West. In the new Bristol Central, Denyer beat Debbonaire by more than 10,000. These huge swings show what is possible.\nIn other seats, independents and small parties came within a hair of ousting senior Labour candidates — Leanne Mohamad was fewer than 600 votes from defeating Wes Streeting in Ilford North, while the Workers’ Party’s Jody McIntyre missed beating Jess Phillips in Birmingham Yardley by a similar number.\nAnd of course, Keir Starmer himself lost almost half of his vote in Holborn and St Pancrase — the first new Prime Minister to enter office with a reduced vote — while Andrew Feinstein received 19 per cent as an independent and Jeremy Corbyn won by a mile in neighbouring Islington North.\nThe biggest driver of these changes was likely voters’ disgust with Labour’s lack of opposition in relation to Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians and refusal to condemn the genocide in Gaza, but Britain’s electorate also wants real change and hope at home, not tinkering around the edges or the same as the past 14 years with a bit more efficiency.\nHow should the left respond to polarised parliamentary results in which reduced votes can win a landslide, and to the rise of the far right, which now exists as an open presence in the Commons?\nElections are important, but under a dysfunctional political system that rewards the undeserving and little-supported with huge majorities, our resistance must be outside Parliament, in protests and direct action but also the battle of ideas and narrative.\nWe need to harness the public’s awareness of and outrage at the genocide in Gaza to build an even stronger anti-racist movement. We must strengthen our presence in the trade unions and work concertedly toward winning democratic and functional control of those bodies, which should be the engine of socialist political and societal reform but too often are not.\nWe must prepare thoroughly to ensure that, when Labour carries out its plans to extend NHS privatisation and strengthen the role of profit in public services and finance, we are effective in making sure the public is aware of what is really being done.\nWe must be relentless in demanding an end to the genocide in Gaza and in spotlighting Starmer’s complicity in it. Support for genocide, is the greatest form of racism, that we must confront.\nAnd of course, with Starmer refusing to reverse even the most obvious evils like the two-child benefit cap that pushes 300,000 children into poverty and drastically worsens the lives of over a million more, we must be ready to make sure that the public’s inevitable disgust at the continued degradation of our quality of life, public services and social fabric is directed at the real causes and those behind them, and not at the usual scapegoats of refugees, the unemployed and the disabled.\nWith the far right now openly in Parliament and threatening Starmer’s tenure — whether through continuing to stand or even, conceivably, by withdrawing in many seats to allow the Tories to recover — the pressure to move even further right will be added to his innate authoritarianism and lead to the danger of even greater repression and greater targeting of the vulnerable.\nThis is a hugely dangerous moment for our country and requires all of our absolute commitment to resist — but it is not insurmountable. Even Financial Times data guru John Burns-Murdoch noted that “Labour voters this time are even less enthusiastic about their party than Tory voters were in 2019. If [it doesn’t] start delivering tangible results, it wouldn’t be at all surprising to see Labour start bleeding votes in all directions.”\nThe left must make sure that as many of those votes bleed toward socialism, social justice and the real restoration of our society, not toward greater racism and repression.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the former member of Parliament for Leicester East (2019-24).

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_city-mp-leading-calls-for-emancipation-day-to-become-a-bank-holiday/content_850.html": "City MP leading calls for Emancipation Day to become a bank holiday\nAn annual event marking an important part of British history, especially for the Black community, should be Britain’s next Bank Holiday, says a Leicester MP. The call is being made in the run-up to this year’s commemorations in the city to mark Emancipation Day.\nOn 1 August 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act was passed, which outlawed slavery in most British colonies including Canada. More than 800,000 people were freed after the deed was passed through parliament.\nThe Abolition of the Slave Trade Act, passed by the British Parliament in 1807, outlawed the slave trade after centuries of activism but this did nothing to free the existing enslaved workforce in the British empire. But during the 1820s and early 1830s, a strong network of women’s anti-slavery associations developed.\nn 1823, religious groups, politicians and supporters from around the country came together to form the Anti-Slavery Society. Ultimately, this resulted in the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act finally being passed, meaning that from then on, it would be illegal for people, largely of the Black community, and their descendants to be bought, sold or kept in slavery.\nFast forward to the present day, many of Britain’s former colonies celebrate the first day of August as Emancipation Day with either a bank holiday or a day of cultural activities. Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines all have an official commemoration.\nDespite its widespread recognition across the world, Britain is still yet to acknowledge Emancipation day as an official holiday. Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe is one of those calling for it to be made a formal Bank Holiday in Britain.\nShe said: “We are approaching a monumental day in British and World history, yet one which is barely recognised or commemorated in the UK. It is long overdue that the UK joins this global trend, and commemorates August 1 as a bank holiday.\n“As well as confronting our imperial history, this would also improve the lot of all English workers – who get four fewer public holidays than the EU average. All UK workers deserve more bank holidays, and there is no better place to start.\n“Whilst the legacy of Emancipation Day showcases the reluctance of the colonial state against the bravery of committed activists, it is all the more vital we highlight this chapter of our collective past because present day injustices are inseparable from the historical origins of racism, imperialism and oppression.\n“The story of Emancipation is of a mass movement struggling against the intransigence of vested interests, as slaveholders were compensated with today’s equivalent of £17 billion, which was not paid off by the British public until 2015, whilst freed slaves were continually exploited and made to work as unpaid apprentices. Emancipation Day should receive the national commemoration that it deserves.”\nA selection of groups in Leicester are also eager to celebrate. The Urban Equestrian Academy have teamed up with EDUK8GLOBAL to host an eight-mile historical family walk and hack on the day.\nWalkers will assemble at Nelson Mandela Park at 9.30am, and shortly after a coach will carry walkers to Rothley Court Hotel in Loughborough. The day will be packed with activities such as speeches and face painting, and breakfast will also be provided free of charge.\nFounder of the Urban Equestrian Academy, Freedom Zampaladus said: “Many people particularly residents in Leicester and Leicestershire are unfamiliar with the history of Rothley Court which is where we will be hosting our event. It’s famous for being the birth place of the Knights Templers or the ‘Freemasons’ and secondly its ties to the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.\n“Rothley is the birthplace of Thomas Babington who was an abolitionist and right hand man to William Wilberforce. They were amongst those who spearheaded the anti-slave trade movement.\n“Right here on our doorstep, we have one of the most important pieces of history, and it’s not even discussed. I believe its important to celebrate Emancipation Day, specifically in Leicester because if history such as the one I explained before was to become more mainstream, then it would actually help bring communities together – these are prominent white people that should be credited as anti-racist.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_independents-and-candidates-from-small-parties-are-the-hope-of-real-change-in-the-election/content_189.html": "Independents and candidates from small parties are the hope of real change in the election.\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nBreaking the duopoly of British politics is not easy, but it is essential as working people are crying out for change, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE\nIT IS A cliche, or perhaps a truism, of British parliamentary politics that in the “first-past-the-post” parliamentary electoral system, the odds are stacked against independent candidates and even against the smaller political parties.\nThe Greens, despite having a solid voter base and receiving more than a million votes in 2015, have only had Caroline Lucas in the House of Commons.\nThat view was borne out for decades. From the abolition of university constituencies in 1950 to the end of the 20th century, the only MP elected as an independent was former war correspondent Martin Bell, who became MP for Tatton after declaring his candidacy only 24 days before the 1997 general election.\nDespite the incumbent Tory MP Neil Hamilton being mired in sleaze allegations, Bell’s win was a huge upset: Tatton is usually one of the safest Tory seats in the country, yet Bell went from nowhere to a 60 per cent vote share, on a high turnout, in just over three weeks.\nBell’s election, despite his overwhelming majority and the notoriety of his victory, did not mark a turning point in British politics. After his term in Tatton, he moved on to stand, again as an independent, against Tory Eric Pickles in Brentwood and Ongar, coming second and reducing Pickles’s majority by more than 70 per cent in the 2001 general election. But since Bell’s 1997 win, only a very small handful of MPs have been elected as independents — as opposed to becoming independent after being elected as candidates of major parties.\nMany would argue that there is little room for doubt that the first-past-the post system has allowed the construction of a deeply unhealthy Westminster politics. Tony Blair spent 13 years, by his own admission, building on Margaret Thatcher’s political “achievements” rather than trying to undo the damage she and John Major had done.\nUnder the first five years of Tory-led government from 2010, Ed Miliband’s Labour thought it needed to become more like the Tories to be credible, leading to abhorrent promises to be “tougher than the Tories” on benefit claimants and the obscenity of Labour’s “Controls on Immigration” mug.\nThat consensus was threatened, against the Establishment’s expectation and to its horror, by Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership election wins and near-success in the 2017 general election. Corbyn became the first Labour leader in decades to promise real change, uniting the elites against him.\nOnce he was successfully removed, Britain’s political elites have closed ranks to try to remove real choice from voters. Keir Starmer’s Labour is almost indistinguishable from its Conservative “opponents” on immigration, public spending, war and imperialism, privatisation, policing, the treatment of the poor and their children, the continued fragmentation and rationing of our NHS and support for Israel’s mass murder of Palestinians. Labour is also indistinguishable in its treatment of black, Asian and Gypsy-Traveller communities.\nThe pledges Starmer made to win the Labour leadership involved real change. All have been cast aside completely, like the promise to renationalise the NHS and other vital public services, or watered down to the point of meaninglessness, like the promised package of workers’ rights.\nThis homogenisation of the two biggest parties to protect capitalism, imperialism and the status quo has left voters with a choice, in the bluntest terms, of which rosette colour they’d like their ruling party to wear.\nBreaking that duopoly is not easy, but it is essential — millions of ordinary people in this country, especially in England, are crying out for real, radical change and for candidates who will represent them, not a narrow set of corporate and elite interests.\nThis change will not be easy, but it may be that now is the best time in three-quarters of a century to achieve it. The dissatisfaction with the pro-privatisation, pro-cuts, pro-capitalist, billionaire-friendly consensus among the political Establishment is running deep and wide — and it is being amplified and intensified by the visceral disgust at the knowing support for Israel’s genocide on the part of both the Tories and the Labour leadership.\nThe hundreds of thousands who turn out in all weathers every week to demand a halt to the slaughter of Palestinian civilians are just the tip of a very large iceberg of voters — three-quarters of the British electorate want the immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza that the main political parties will not demand, and the numbers are high no matter which party they usually support.\nA YouGov poll last month showed that overall, 73 per cent of voters want an immediate ceasefire — and 55 per cent support stopping arms sales to Israel to achieve it. Even among 2019 Conservative voters, 67 per cent want a ceasefire and 40 per cent support an arms ban; Keir Starmer’s issue is even more serious — among Labour voters, 86 per cent want a ceasefire and 74 per cent support an end to weapons exports.\nCommon humanity and the revulsion among reasonable people, at the sights and sounds of maimed and orphaned children is combining with the anger at the continued degradation of everything that our class and its allies built across eight decades to make Britain a country to be proud of.\nThere is also disgust at the continuing destruction of decent jobs, wages and housing availability, all of which demands a real alternative and is driving the hunger for independent candidates — and those of smaller parties — who will stand up for the wishes and interests of ordinary people and for justice worldwide.\nThe expression of this hunger could be seen just last month in the local election results. While both Labour and the Tories went backwards compared to a year earlier according to electoral expert Sir John Curtice, independent candidates and small parties were the big winners in terms of vote share and the electoral calculations suggested a hung Parliament that would give left candidates a genuine influence over policy.\nBefore that, the same forces saw George Galloway trounce both Labour and the Tories in the Rochdale by-election for the Workers Party of Britain, just as he had done before in Bethnal Green (2005) and in Bradford West (2012) for the Respect party.\nIn a first-past-the-post election and its inherent bias toward the duopoly, the challenge is always to turn those percentage gains into seats. But with outstanding independent candidates in winnable seats — Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North, Leanne Mohammed in Ilford North, Sam Gorst in Garston where the Liverpool independents hammered Labour last year and others across the country, there is a real opportunity for independents.\nIf we can seize the chance and find the ways to reach people with a message of hope and real change, if we galvanise and build on public anger with the status quo, its cost in lives and quality of life and the refusal of either main party to offer anything different from the misery and stagnation of the last 14 years, then Britain might finally have a better future to look forward to again, as well as a chance to change the electoral system so that the Establishment stranglehold can be broken.\nThe challenge is a significant one, but for the sake of our people and especially for the future of our class, we have to achieve it.\nClaudia Webbe is the independent parliamentary candidate for Leicester East.\nYou can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",
  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_bangladeshi-democracy-is-just-window-dressing/content_133.html": "Bangladeshi democracy is just window-dressing\nBy Claudia Webbe\nSupport for both the students and the workers of Bangladesh is an imperative, as they fight unjust and brutal government impositions, says CLAUDIA WEBBE\nDESPITE brutal state repression of protest including the murder of protesting students, the public desecration of the bodies of victims and a shutdown of educational institutions in Bangladesh, the resistance movement of students and others in that country has continued to gather strength.\nThe Bangladeshi government has admitted that at least 147 protesters have been killed so far by state police and militias, but Amnesty International puts the number at over 200 and says that the Bangladeshi government has issued “shoot to kill” orders to its forces, including army units and militias, to put down the unrest.\nAnger at unfair and nepotistic government employment practices has swelled into a general rage at what protesters consider to be structural injustice and corruption under a dictatorial regime.\nAs well as the violence already inflicted on demonstrators, the government has declared a nationwide curfew, imposed a communications blackout, arguably to try to limit international awareness, and has used troops against protesters.\nIn one viral and shocking video, the body of a student was carried through Dhaka on top of an armoured troop carrier before falling off and being left in the street.\nThe unrest began as protests against the Bangladeshi Supreme Court’s decision to reinstate a quota system that reserved government jobs for descendants of those who fought in the 1971 liberation war — a system that has often been used to reward government loyalists and led to protests in 2018 that saw more than 250 casualties but ultimately led to the revocation of the quota system that reserved more than half of Civil Service jobs for privileged categories, and including admirably for women and disabled people, but the protesters have called for an end to the reservation of around a third for the descendants of liberation war veterans.\nSuch government positions are among the best employment opportunities available for young people in a country still on the United Nations’ Least Developed Countries list.\nOfficial government figures say that 41 per cent of Bangladeshi youth are economically inactive and two-thirds of university graduates are unable to find work — the real situation is likely to be far worse.\nIn an economy where exploitation and abuse are rife in the workplace, many of those who can find work face poverty pay, long hours and unfit workplaces, as international buyers demand prices that are often less than the cost of production, as notorious fast fashion scandals and a string of fires and garment building collapses have underlined. These factors have played a major role in driving the outrage among young people at the injustice of the reservation system.\nYoung people represent a majority of Bangladesh’s population: almost two-thirds of Bangladeshis are below 35 years of age, of whom almost half — around 45 million people — are aged 15-24.\nWith only about 1.2 per cent of people able to access university, disadvantage and hopelessness are baked in, condemning millions to a life of poverty at levels that preclude even adequate food and shelter.\nThese realities mean that the current protests largely involve young people from the middle class but, many would argue, it is still a struggle that international socialists must support, because if it succeeds it can represent a first step in unpicking a capitalist and corrupt system designed to keep millions poor and underemployed so that employers can keep wages and prospects low and profits high.\nSheikh Hasina’s Awami League government has been in power since 2009 and has grown increasingly neoliberal and authoritarian, repressing dissent generally and particularly on university campuses, arbitrarily arresting critics and even imprisoning teenagers for online comments about the government.\nThe 2018 Digital Security Act allows the regime to arrest without warrants, enabling the detention and trial of human rights activists just for speaking out against injustice. This year’s general election was boycotted by the opposition when over 20,000 of its activists were arrested.\nEven more than in Britain and US, Bangladeshi democracy is window-dressing to the interests of the elite. The government’s brutality may be heightened by a fear of the potential for the student protests to spread to a general uprising.\nThat fear is not without foundation: the liberation war against Pakistan began with an uprising of students in 1968 who, outraged at the murder of a student by police, started protesting against the military dictatorship.\nThe working class in general joined the resistance against capitalist exploitation — capital, as always, sided with fascism against the workers — and the uprising brought down the military regime.\nThe imposition of martial law by the Pakistani government in response to the left’s successes in the ensuing elections led to the deaths of at least 300,000 people and by some estimates, as high as three million.\nIn the mass revolt and civil war that followed, Bengali students were again at the forefront of the fight for freedom and the advancement of the working class, ultimately leading to the liberation and independence of Bangladesh. But the forces of capital and reaction were able to maintain and then tighten their hold, leading Bangladesh back toward exploitation and the bulk of the population into poverty.\nAs ever, the regime lives in constant fear of the masses realising their power, making the current movement an existential threat not only to those in government but to the capital and corruption that support them.\nAs suppression continues to fail, the government is likely to resort to offering the students minor concessions in the hope of sapping their resolve. If the students are tempted by this tactic, capitalism will manage to stave off another culmination of its crisis and the ruling classes will again find ways to erode and undo any reforms, leading to a situation even worse than the one that led to the protest movement, just as they did with the temporary victory of 2018 against the quota system.\nIt can be argued that if the will of Bangladeshi students falters before a decisive victory, this will create a setback not just for our class in Bangladesh but worldwide.\nOn the other hand, if the students of Bangladesh achieve decisive change, that will foster class awareness in other nations of the ongoing crisis of capitalism and the opportunity for real change to be turned into a global phenomenon.\nAs we saw in the protest movement against the war in Vietnam and others since, students are often the first to rise against injustice, but without the support of the organised working class generally they cannot maintain the drive toward lasting change and capitalist structures are able to divert and dissipate their energy and resolve until much or all of the impact of their efforts, dissolves.\nThis makes the conscious and persistent support of our whole movement, in Britain and elsewhere, for both the students and the workers of Bangladesh, an imperative. This applies, of course, everywhere that workers and students rise up, but Bangladesh is at least one major front in the class struggle and the prospect of its advancement.\nJust as capital is facing an existential threat, so does our class around the world as those enjoying privilege resort more and more to oppression and outright fascism to try to maintain it. But we also have an almost-unprecedented opportunity, as the uprising in Bangladesh, mass protests in Kenya, Kashmir, Argentina and other places, and the awakening of millions uniting against Israel’s genocide of the Palestinians recrystallises a class awareness that capital has spent decades and billions shutting down.\nIf we are to move forward, we must give our consistent support to the resistance in Bangladesh and wherever else it rises.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the former member of Parliament for Leicester East (2019-24).

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-international-community-must-show-solidarity-with-indian-farmers/content_932.html": "The international community must show solidarity with Indian farmers\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nAs socialists, we must stand alongside workers who are resisting the undemocratic imposition of even more extractive forms of capitalism and neoliberalism writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIN RECENT days, the scenes from India’s farmers’ protest have been horrific.\nFollowing large-scale protests in Delhi on January 26, the situation has become incredibly violent.\nProtesters are being killed, injured and unjustly imprisoned.\nVideo footage demonstrates that police and violent mobs are assaulting peaceful protesters, destroying their living areas.\nAt least one protester has sadly died due to this violence and many have been unjustly imprisoned.\nThe Indian community plays a hugely important role in modern British society.\nThere is a large Indian diaspora in Britain, and particularly in my own constituency of Leicester East, who make a unique and incredibly valuable contribution to our community.\nI am incredibly proud that Leicester has the second highest proportion of Indian residents out of any city in the UK, and that Indians make up one of the largest groups in our city.\nTherefore, like many of my constituents, whether from the Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan or other states across India and people across the world, I am very concerned that the Indian government feels that it can treat these peaceful protesters with violence, injustice and a complete lack of respect for basic human rights.\nThis week’s escalation is the latest in an over two-month stand-off between farmers and the Indian government over the implementation of new agricultural laws to deregulate the farming sector.\nThe laws, if implemented, would arguably lead to the privatisation and corporate takeover of the country’s agricultural sector and would create an adverse effect on India’s food security.\nIndia’s farmers have resisted and are protesting against this free-market takeover of their farms.\nUnrest began in late November when over 250 million farmers across India participated in a general strike in response to the new laws.\nThe contentious legislation is comprised of three Bills — the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce Act, the Farmers Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities Act.\nTaken together, these laws will remove government protections for farmers that have been in place for decades, including guaranteed minimum prices for crops.\nAs socialists, we must stand in solidarity with workers who resist the undemocratic imposition of even more extractive forms of capitalism and neoliberalism.\nI fear that we are witnessing democracy being cast aside along with basic human rights, including freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly.\nFor Britain to pride itself on being a world leader of democracy, we must lead the international community in holding the Indian government to account for its actions.\nThe British government must formally condemn the state violence and raise concerns about the mistreatment and violence against protesters with their counterparts in the Indian government immediately.\nI have also encouraged the Westminster government to speak with the Indian government about listening to the farmers’ concerns and engaging with them and their unions.\nThe farmers are clear they want the laws scrapped.\nIt is also important that we recognise the role of Britain in materially supporting violence and oppression across the globe.\nBritain was the world’s second-biggest arms exporter behind the United States over the past decade.\nOrders worth £11 billion were won by UK arms manufacturers in 2019 alone, which represents 16 per cent of all weapons sold across the world in that year.\nBritain has licensed £550 million worth of arms to India since May 2015.\nI have therefore urged the British government to immediately cease the sale of weapons, including water cannon, tear gas and batons, which could be used against protesters in India.\nJust as it was morally reprehensible for Britain to export riot equipment to the US that was used against Black Lives Matter protesters following the murder of George Floyd, it is wrong for peaceful Indian protesters to be brutalised by equipment sold from Britain.\nWe cannot allow British companies to profit from the suffering of Indian farmers.\nIt is especially vital that the British government must not finance the global spread of extractive neoliberalism.\nYet that is exactly what they have been doing. The Conceptual Framework on Agriculture and the UK-India Infrastructure Technical Co-operation Facility promotes contract farming (one of the issues the farmers are protesting about) and finances consultants to “alleviate bottlenecks to private-sector investment in agriculture” in India.\nThe British government must revise this deeply worrying international arrangement.\nI have also encouraged the government to stop exports of pesticides banned in Britain to India and other countries, including Paraquat, which is responsible for thousands of farmer deaths in India — a situation so severe that doctors in India have resorted to hunger strikes demanding a ban on its usage.\nSo far, there has been a disgraceful lack of solidarity from the British government and the wider international community.\nIn an era where political leadership is sadly lacking, I am grateful for others who have stepped forward to speak out on this issue — including the climate activist Greta Thunburg, internationally acclaimed singer Rhianna and Meena Harris, the niece of Kamala Harris, the US Vice-President.\nYet I, along with other supporters of the farmers’ cause, have been subjected to horrific, racist, misogynist and violent online abuse for standing in solidarity with Indian farmers.\nSocial media companies and government must work together to root out the epidemic of abuse that plagues the online political sphere.\nYet I shall not be silenced. Across the globe, we must stand in solidarity with Indian farmers who are peacefully protesting against government attempts to railroad exploitative, extractive free market capitalism into their farming communities.\nTogether, we must fight for a world free of online abuse and free of the exploitation that the Indian farmers are currently suffering from.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Yet Gandhi was part of creating a historical anti-imperialist movement in the same way that Martin Luther King created a ground-breaking civil rights movement.\n“His form of peaceful protest, like Black Lives Matter today, was a powerful force for change.\n“The difference between a statue of Gandhi and statues of slavers such as Edward Colston, is that there is no reasonable debate that Colston – who derived his wealth from the murderous slave trade – is a morally defensible figure to be memorialised.\n“The same cannot be said for Gandhi, who remains a hero to many of Leicester’s Asian community and to millions across the world.”\nMs Webbe spoke out on the issue of the Gandhi statue after her predecessor as MP Keith Vaz arrived with city councillors and community volunteers to throw up a symbolic human ring around the piece of art.\nMr Vaz, who stood down as an MP after more than 30 years representing his city constituency prior to December’s General Election, had vowed to “defend it personally”. Speaking to Leicestershire Live , he said: “It is shameful that people have made threats against this statue and petitioned to have it removed.\n“It is an iconic monument in our city – Mahatma Gandhi was an inspiration for Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.\n“He was a peacemaker and changed the lives of millions – to accuse him of racism is deplorable.”\nThe statue was privately funded but the city council has said will consider the petition to have it taken down.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_labour-mp-calls-for-extension-of-migrant-rights-for-nhs-workers-and-their-families/content_821.html": "Labour MP calls for extension of migrant rights for NHS workers and their families\nClaudia Webbe has urged the government to grant permanent residency to migrant NHS workers and their dependent family members, and highlighted that several of the health workers to have died from coronavirus were first generation immigrants.\nThe Labour MP for Leicester East wrote to the Home Secretary today, describing how the health crisis has shown the “undeniable contribution of migrants to our society” but how for many, their future residency in the UK is unsure.\nShe also said that if a migrant NHS worker dies their family members should receive full pension and death benefits, and has urged the Home Secretary to scrap the NHS surcharge for all health workers and their families.\nWebbe said: “Over 13% of all NHS staff are migrants, including 28% of doctors and 16% of nurses. Of these, there are a significant number of NHS workers, and their families, whose future residency in the UK is not secured.\n“In the current system, if an NHS worker tragically dies due to work related illnesses, the future of their dependent family members living in the UK is not guaranteed. This means vulnerable individuals could face deportation whilst grieving for their loved one.”\nAt least 13 of those NHS workers to have died from Covid-19 were first generation immigrants. The first confirmed hospital frontline worker to die after testing positive for the virus, Dr Amged El-Hawrani, was born in Sudan for example.\nShe added: “For many migrant NHS professionals, the stress of potential ill health, and even death, is compounded by the fact that their family members are not guaranteed a future in the UK. This reveals both the heroism of our NHS workers, and the cruelty of the current immigration system.\n“It does not seem fair or just to expect migrant NHS professionals to risk their lives for a country in which their dependent family does not have a permanent future. I urge the government to take this opportunity to honour the dedication and sacrifice of all NHS workers, no matter their country of birth.”\nA cross-party group of more than 60 MPs wrote to Priti Patel last week, urging her to grant indefinite leave to remain to migrant health workers, and recognise that “those who have put their lives at risk for our country are welcome to live in it”.\nThe Home Office has announced an automatic 12 month extension of visas for health workers from October 1st, but MPs have said that this does not go far enough. The first four doctors to die from the virus were born overseas.\nThere are now a total of 103,093 confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK, but given low levels of testing in the population the true figure is thought to be much higher. So far, there have been 13,729 confirmed hospital deaths in relation to Covid-19.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_punishing-the-poor-but-yet-more-handouts-to-the-rich/content_640.html": "Punishing the poor, but yet more handouts to the rich\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Tories’ latest assault on the sick and disabled is deadly and economically illiterate, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE government’s renewed assault on Britain’s poor and disabled is shameful — but it is entirely in line with the behaviour of a party whose disregard for the wellbeing of ordinary people and contempt for human rights, the law and our legal system have been growing, year on year, for more than a decade now.\nTony Benn once said that we should watch how governments treat refugees because it shows how they will treat us if they can get away with it. He was right — and the homogenisation of the political landscape, with the Tories and the “opposition” marching almost in lockstep on spending and human rights, has clearly convinced this government that it can get away with a lot.\nRishi Sunak’s determination to bypass the Supreme Court’s decision against his government’s deportation of refugees to Rwanda rightly made headlines last week, but Sunak and his Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also turned their fire again on the sick and disabled.\nAfter 13 years of policies that have caused untold misery for the poor and especially for disabled people — and for hundreds of thousands of excess deaths — the Tories are not just targeting refugees for dehumanisation and punitive measures.\nIn the same week that Sunak demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law and the integrity of judges, his Hunt’s department trailed measures for this week’s Budget that will penalise the chronically ill for failing to find work or for rejecting coercive measures to force them into work.\nA University of Glasgow study a year ago found that more than 330,000 excess deaths were the “result” of austerity — and that austerity had not just halted the decades-long increase in British life expectancy, but had thrown it into reverse, especially among poorer people.\nRather than respond to this confirmation of the appalling effects of austerity by changing course, the government is now redoubling its assault on the poor, sick and disabled, scapegoating them for the government’s failure to grow the economy.\nSunak has even brought back Esther McVey, one of the main figures in the austerity regime, to battle “wokeness” — or as we would call it, empathy.\nHunt plans to cut benefit claimants off completely from state support if they fail to convince DWP representatives that they are doing enough to find work — an escalation of the already punitive sanctions regime for those judged not to be trying hard enough to find work, or even for missing an appointment because of illness.\nTo make matters even worse, he plans to remove access to free NHS medicines, dental care and help with energy bills — in the middle of an energy cost crisis — from those who fall foul of his proposed new system. And because Hunt knows that doctors will refuse to certify a sick person as fit for work, the government plans to usurp the role of medical professionals, taking away from doctors the judgement about who can work.\nTo compound the problems still further, instead of proper medical care and an honest recognition of a person’s ill health, the Tories plan to impose “life coaches for the long-term sick” and “talking therapies” on those it deems fit to work no matter what expert medical opinion says.\nAnyone who either refuses this “help” or fails to respond with the required enthusiasm will be punished. The awful consequences of these moves are not hard to predict, especially for those with long-term, complex health conditions or disabilities, or for those suffering poor mental health.\nIndeed, as long ago as 2014, NHS data showed that more than four in 10 people claiming out-of-work disability benefits had attempted suicide because of the punishing and attritional “fit to work” assessment regime. That percentage was double the rate found in the previous survey seven years earlier. The benefits regime has only become more severe since.\nThe Tories’ treatment of disabled people has been so horrific that in 2017 the UN committee on the rights of persons with disabilities condemned the British government for creating a “human catastrophe” for those with disabilities.\nSince then, the number of poor people in the UK has rocketed to 14 million, well over four million of them children. Children from families with a disabled or long-term sick member are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as those in households with no disability — a figure that was measured before the impact of the pandemic and then the cost-of-living crisis.\nThe government claims that these sanctions will not be applied to those with children or to people with disabilities. But medical professionals and disability campaigners are surely right to point out that, based on the ever-worsening track record of successive Tory governments, the new regime will be used to legitimise discrimination against people with chronic illnesses or disabilities.\nSuch discrimination is unequivocally against the Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) banning inhuman or degrading treatment and requiring states to protect human rights and the right to life.\nIt is also fundamentally counterproductive. As economist Stephen Koukoulas pointed out in 2015, it is “overwhelmingly” clear that if you want to grow the economy you need to put more money into the pockets of the poor, because they will spend it and increase economic activity. Instead, Hunt has failed to denounce that tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations will feature in his Autumn Statement.\nBy responding to this epidemic of poverty and despair by punishing the poor and giving yet more handouts to the rich, Hunt and Sunak are doing the opposite of what they claim to be trying to achieve.\nAnd it must be said that in large part they feel emboldened to do this because the current Labour leadership has bought into the false narrative of austerity — the “magic money tree” deception — and announced its own intentions to restrict spending if Labour get into government.\nUnder Jeremy Corbyn, Labour had won the argument on austerity — and it showed in the reaction of the Tories, who performed U-turn after U-turn under Theresa May and then Boris Johnson, suddenly finding the “magic” money for spending because someone was making the argument that the Conservatives’ obsession with cuts was a political choice and never an economic necessity.\nThat argument remains no less true now, but nobody on a Commons front bench is making it, instead allowing the Tories to return with gusto the “conscious cruelty” — and economic damage — of a system that for 13 years now has punished the poor for being poor while heaping rewards on those who are already grotesquely wealthy.\nBritain desperately needs that argument to be heard — the poor and disabled that Sunak and Hunt are targeting need it most desperately of all. When it is not being even whispered by either Labour or the Tories, it is up to us to shout it all the louder and refuse to be silenced.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_debt-cancellation-is-vital-for-global-recovery/content_698.html": "Debt cancellation is vital for global recovery\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nCancelling debt for poor countries is desperately needed to shore up public health systems, social protections and address global structural inequality writes Claudia Webbe MP\nThe global Black Lives Matter movement has drawn attention to systemic inequalities in our economy and society in the UK, the United States and across the world. This structural inequality means the poorest countries – overwhelmingly former colonies – are tied into exploitative relationships with the richest countries.\nOne mechanism through which these exploitative relationships are both exemplified and reinforced is through the debt the poorest countries have been saddled with.\nThis has historically taken the form of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank tying loans to the implementation of ‘structural adjustment’ measures (often what we would recognise as austerity), as happened in Ecuador last year for example.\nOther countries have been stuck in ‘debt traps’ – meaning they have to borrow more money just to service growing debt burdens, at the expense of lives, livelihoods and wellbeing – for much of the time since they stopped formally being colonies.\nEven before the coronavirus pandemic hit, 64 countries spent more in servicing their external debts – including to richer countries, multilateral organizations such as the IMF, and private lenders – than they did on the healthcare of their own people.\nRed Pepper – Big Solar Summer 23\nRed Pepper – EPC July-Sept 23\nThe ten countries with the biggest difference between the proportion of government revenue spent on healthcare and external debt payments were Angola, Sri Lanka, The Gambia, Republic of Congo, Ghana, Zambia, Laos, Lebanon, Pakistan and Cameroon. Astonishingly, these ten all spent over 20% of government revenue on external debt payments in 2019. It is simply indefensible that some of the poorest countries are having to spend more money on debt payments than meeting the basic health needs of their people.\nGlobal action\nFor this and many other reasons, I was proud to join more than 300 lawmakers from around the world based in over two dozen nations in recently calling on political leaders and global financial organizations—including the IMF and World Bank—to cancel poor nations’ debt as they work to combat the coronavirus crisis.\nWith reference to the 70 International Development Association (IDA) countries, the letter calls ‘on all G20 leaders through these [international financial institutions] to support the cancellation of debt obligations held by all IDA countries during this unprecedented pandemic.’\nIt adds that ‘the vulnerable communities that lack the resources and privileges to adopt adequate public health measures will ultimately face the disproportionate burden of coronavirus’. The letter was initiated by US lawmakers Ilhan Omar and Bernie Sanders. As Congresswoman Omar said, ‘We as a global community must seize this opportunity to get relief to those who are suffering by cancelling debt for nations who cannot afford it’.\nWhilst the recent IMF announcement of temporary debt relief funding for 25 poorer member countries is an encouraging development, much more widespread action is still needed. It is therefore vitally important that progressives around the world demand debt cancellation. This means moving beyond recently agreed measures of temporary suspension of payments.\nEconomic solidarity\nCommitting to debt cancellation is a fast way to enable countries to have the financing desperately needed to shore up public health systems and social protection in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. It would also mean more resources for the extraordinary challenges of reconstruction.\nAs Bernie Sanders said, without sweeping debt relief, poor nations could be forced to ‘dedicate money that should be going towards protecting the health and safety of their people to pay off unsustainable debts’.\nCountries that cannot adopt adequate public health measures will face the heaviest burden of coronavirus. We must not stand by and allow these countries to be without the resources desperately needed to purchase medicine, protective equipment, food, and much more besides.\nThe stark reality is that without cancellation, hundreds of millions of people around the world could face an unprecedented economic collapse. There would inevitably be an accompanying humanitarian crisis, with unimaginable increases in poverty, hunger, and associated diseases. These would only further burden already underfunded healthcare systems.\nAn end to business as usual\nThe coronavirus crisis has shown just how interdependent we are on each other, both here in Britain and across the world. As well as the humanitarian imperative to cancel debt, this means that, in today’s globally connected economy, if cancellation does not happen people here in Britain will also feel the effects. The British economy – although one of the largest economies in the world – doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Failure to tackle the international debt issue will lead to many countries in the Global South entering deep recessions, greatly harming the global economy and chances of recovery.\nOn the other hand, cancelling debt would contribute to global economic recovery. As the letter argues, as ‘an international community, we can only begin to move past this pandemic once this pandemic ends for everyone’.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is showing the anger at injustice, and demanding real change and equality on a global scale. Exploitative relationships based on the days of colonialism must end.\nAt the IMF for example, there are 189 member countries, but the US and its allies in richer countries, including the UK, have always had a majority of decision-making votes. We should argue that the UK utilises its position and advocates for debt cancellation in this forum, while urging the US to do the same. Indeed the same applies to the World Bank where the UK remains a major shareholder. The opportunity should also be taken to put forward the case that the very nature of the international economy needs to change.\nWe must ensure that after the economic, social and health devastation of the Covid-19 crisis – and the global crises of inequality and climate change that preceded it – there is no return to business as usual. Disgracefully, the Conservatives are more interested in scrapping the Department for International Development than they are in creating a more equitable global economy. Just like their main ally Trump, they seem to have nothing but contempt for the Global South.\nNow is the time to build a different, better world. Now is the time for the world to act as a global community. It is time to put people and public health first.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_british-imperialisms-shameful-role-in-gaza-and-yemen-2/content_240.html": "British Imperialism’s shameful role in Gaza and Yemen\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nCLAUDIA WEBBE MP: BRITAIN’S HISTORY OF ACTIONS IN AND AGAINST YEMEN HAS BEEN A SHAMEFUL ONE, SURPASSED ONLY PERHAPS BY ITS BETRAYAL OF THE PALESTINIANS FROM BALFOUR ONWARDS\nThe current bombing of Yemen is anything but new — the bombing of Yemen, colonised by Britain until 1967, has occurred in at least 15 of the last 100 years.\nThis number does not include the period from 2014, when the ground crews of Britain’s RAF were embedded with the Saudi air force, as it bombed hospitals, funerals and food stores as part of the Saudi-led, US-backed, war on Yemen, compounding the violence and famine inflicted on innocent civilians.\nAccording to the UN, the direct violence of bombs — many of them made and supplied by Britain — and bullets killed more than 150,000 people, while almost a quarter of a million were killed by hunger and disease, 11,000 or more of them children.\nDuring this period, since 2014, according to Action on Armed Violence, Britain has licensed around £7.5 billion of arms sales and weapons to Saudi Arabia, a marked acceleration.\nThere was a lull in the bombing in 2022, after the Houthis struck Saudi oil facilities, prompting a renewal of negotiations. Then, only last month, UN envoy Hans Grundberg announced agreement among the parties on a ceasefire and a commitment to a UN-led peace process — at last, a chance of real respite for the suffering millions of Yemen.\nYet now, tragically, Yemen is being bombed again — and this time, Britain is doing much more than support and enablement, participating with the US in repeated bombing raids on Houthi facilities that have shattered hopes of peace and inflamed the danger of conflict consuming the whole Middle East region.\nAnd it is doing this because the Houthis have taken action, as they argue, they are obliged to do under international law, to try to pressure Israel into ending its killing of civilians in Gaza, by intercepting shipping bound for or owned by Israel.\nBritain claims its actions in bombing Yemen are to protect trade and have nothing to do with Israel, a claim that Campaign Against the Arms Trade has described as “farcical.”\nGiven their own history, the Yemenis know what the people of Gaza are going through. They know what it’s like to face constant, merciless bombardment and they know what it’s like to suffer hunger and disease from blockades and the intentional destruction of food supplies and hospitals. They know what it’s like to face the worst humanitarian disaster.\nWhile Britain, the US and other Western powers sat on their hands — or worse, provided political cover, logistical support, money and weapons to Israel — arguably, Yemen, took its legal and moral obligations, to intervene to prevent genocide, seriously.\nAnd so, our government and that of the US are bombing them again, valuing commerce and convenience above the lives of innocent civilians.\nBut as so often happens, when imperial powers barge and blunder in, they make things worse, not better. According to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), the bombings have stoked outrage in neighbouring nations and have fuelled the threat of a widened conflict, while doing nothing to protect shipping and trade.\nShipping companies are still shunning the area as danger and insurance costs soar — and now the Houthis have fired at least one missile at a US naval vessel and with another have hit at least one commercial vessel, believing that British and US warships are legitimate targets after the bombing attacks in Yemen.\nThe precipitate nature of Britain’s action was further exposed last Friday when the International Court of Justice (ICJ) announced its findings in relation to South Africa’s genocide case against Israel.\nThe International Court for Justice noted the scale of Israel’s slaughter in Gaza, including the destruction of homes and the forced transfer of the population — in itself a war crime — and noted, too, statements made by among others, Israel’s president and defence minister, making the case of genocide plausible.\nIt also found that these acts, along with Israel’s blockade of food, water, fuel and medical supplies merited a full genocide trial — and ordered Israel to not only stop killing Palestinians in Gaza, but to stop anyone else killing them, too.\nAs Amnesty International noted after the court’s announcement, these findings and orders oblige every signatory to the Genocide Convention to take every available measure to intervene to prevent genocidal acts, including Britain, the US — and Yemen.\nAccording to Euro-Med Monitor, in the two days after the ICJ’s order to Israel to prevent the killing of Palestinians, at least 373 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombings and air strikes — including 345 civilians — and wounded 643 others. Yet Britain and the US continue to ignore their obligations and provide cover and assistance, and are bombing Yemen, in direct violation of international law.\nNot only that, but they have also launched a financial assault on the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides desperately needed humanitarian relief to over two million people of Gaza who are facing constant bombing and a ground invasion alongside the famine and disease that Israel’s continuing blockade and destruction of hospitals and homes have imposed.\nAfter Israel alleged that a handful of UNRWA’s 13,000 Gazan employees participated in the October 7 raid, Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden immediately ended British and US funding for UNRWA. The US is, or was, UNRWA’s biggest single funder, but Israel has long attacked the UN organisation for keeping Palestinian refugees’ hopes alive of returning to the homes from which they were forced out.\nThe withdrawal of US and British funds will be a heavy blow to UNRWA’s ability to help desperate Palestinians in Gaza and is regarded by many analysts as a co-ordinated attempt to accelerate the attrition of famine and disease in defiance of the ICJ’s rulings.\nBritain’s history of actions in and against Yemen has been a shameful one, surpassed only perhaps by its betrayal of the Palestinians from Balfour onwards and now in Sunak’s contemptuous dismissal of the ICJ’s findings and his refusal to make even a gesture toward implementing its binding orders.\nNow Britain is weaving both those shameful histories together, written in bombs, bullets and betrayal, attacking Yemen for its attempts to help the people of Gaza, attacking the people of Gaza by defunding UNRWA and providing materials, logistical support and political cover for Israel’s ongoing mass slaughter.\nThat long and shameful record needs to change, starting now. It’s very clear that the British government, whether the current Sunak regime or a future Labour government under Keir Starmer, will not change course unless they are forced to by relentless political pressure and increased public protest and awareness.\nThat will require an ongoing international campaign and movement and continued protests against Israel’s “genocidal acts” in Gaza and challenging the complicity of Western governments, including Britain that allows Israel to act with impunity.\nAlso, to embrace calls for Britain to stop attacking Yemen, obey its own unequivocal obligations under international law and take its own actions, in line with the ICJ ruling to protect the people of Palestine.\nOur international voices in solidarity will need to be louder. We owe it to the tens of thousands of mostly women and children killed in Gaza and the almost two million Palestinians driven to the brink of starvation. Our rally call must be clear stop bombing Yemen; stop bombing Gaza.\nClaudia Webbe is MP for Leicester East and a Patron of Stop the War Coalition.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_government-economic-support-for-leicester-businesses-unfair-and-not-enough/content_403.html": "Government economic support for Leicester businesses unfair and not enough\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Leicester East MP’s latest in the House Column\nThe Government’s’ treatment of Leicester, as well as regions in the North and Midlands, has been nothing short of a disgrace during recent weeks.\nIt has sacrificed areas of the UK, including Leicester, Greater Manchester, and Newcastle, on the altar of a false, ideologically-driven understanding of the national economy – without providing anywhere near adequate support to protect lives and livelihoods.\nThose of us in Leicester know only too well the consequences of this Government’s miserly support packages. Leicester has been under localised restrictions longer than any other area in the UK – a total of 126 days at the time of writing.\nYet when this began in July, Leicester City Council had to fight for nearly a month to receive just £2.6 million extra to support businesses and jobs – which is only around a quarter of what that city council believed was needed.\nDespite being in lockdown for the longest period, this is considerably less than other parts of the country.\nManchester was recently able to negotiate a £60 million support package for businesses, whilst Liverpool, Lancashire and South\nYorkshire has received £30 million each.\nThis is despite these areas being placed under less strict restrictions than Leicester had been subject to.\nThis is yet another disgraceful attempt from this government to divide communities against each other.\nIt is crucial that every area of the UK, including Leicester, receives the support we need during this unprecedented crisis.\nThat means the government must provide Leicester with backdated economic support that is commensurate with other areas of the country.\nWhat makes this lack of support even more disgraceful, is the billions that the Government has been willing to pay to private companies to oversee the disastrous track and trace system.\nThe £3 million in support offered to Leicester and Oadby and Wigston in July was equal to £7.30 per person.\nThis £7.30 per person is, literally, one thousand times less than the government is paying top consultancy executives for a single day’s work.\nThis demonstrates the flawed priorities of our government, as they are happy to spend tens of millions to enrich private companies – yet are leaving struggling families to sink or swim.\nThe government have also spent £12 billion pounds on a failed test and trace programme which prioritises the enrichment of private corporations over the protection of our communities.\nThis has had a devastating impact on the spread of the virus in Leicester.\nIn one recent week the success rate of Leicester’s privatised contact system was just 55.5 per cent – and this had decreased by more than 5 per cent on the month previously.\nThat means that, in one week alone, nearly 700 Leicester residents who may have been exposed to the virus were not informed, and therefore did not self-isolate.\nThis is a government that is frivolous when it comes to handling public money out to their friends or private companies, but penny-pinching when it comes to bailing out working people across the country.\nPeople in Leicester and across the country cannot afford to live on two-thirds or one fifth of their pre-pandemic earnings.\nEven before this crisis, more than half of the 14 million people in poverty in the UK were in-work.\nDue to extortionate rents and declining living standards, the Conservatives have overseen an unacceptable breakdown in our social contract in which a job no longer provides a route out of destitution.\nThe number of unemployed people in Leicester has more than doubled since the start of Leicester lockdown – from 8,020 to 17,745 so far and food banks in the city reported huge rises in people seeking help to feed themselves and their families.\nAcross the world, countries that have pursued a zero-covid strategy are returning to normality, with all the economic benefits that bring.\nA zero-covid strategy would avoid the cycle of divisive and damaging local lockdowns.\nIt would protect both lives and livelihoods by driving down the virus so that the economy can properly restart when it is safe to do so.\nAcross a recent two-week period, the UK had over 160 times the total cases of five countries – Vietnam, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore, Australia and China – which have a combined population of 1.5 billion compared to the UK’s 69 million.\nThis is a catastrophic failure.\nThe government must urgently increase its economic support to Leicester.\nThen it must follow the best examples set by countries across the world and adopt a zero-covid strategy, underpinned by proper economic support to all and a fully nationalised test and trace system.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_it-will-be-up-to-us-to-protect-pensioners-and-the-triple-lock/content_729.html": "It will be up to us to protect pensioners and the triple lock\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe vast gap between Britain’s pensions and those of other comparable nations shows that low pensions are a political choice, not an economic necessity — and now the Tories are attacking what remains, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE “triple lock” on pensions is all that is left after 12 years of a disastrous Conservative government — and even that is now under threat. In a society where millions are routinely and knowingly condemned to poverty, hunger and misery by Conservative policies, the hope of some stability in retirement was one of the few lights at the end of a very long and very dimly lit tunnel.\nThe government, with an obliging mainstream media and numerous think tanks, has exerted significant energies into warning us that with annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation running at 10.1 per cent, a 40-year high, adhering to the triple lock would prove hugely expensive.\nEconomists have warned that further figures to be released this week will show that inflation accelerated to 10.8 per cent in October. Those who are briefing the media have argued that an estimated £5 billion more, based on current inflation estimates, in the next tax year would be required than if the average earnings figure were used instead.\nAll of this has left pensioners feeling extremely anxious. Like austerity, removing the triple lock is simply class war that has no economic legitimacy in a just and moral society.\nFor those not familiar with the term, the pensions triple lock is a mechanism matching pension increases to whichever is the greater out of annual inflation, average wages or 2.5 per cent — it is a vital means of maintaining some kind of standard of living for those in retirement.\nThe government is said to be considering either doing away with the triple lock completely or reducing it to a “double lock.”\nGiven the soaring rate of inflation, it’s almost certain that the inflation link would be the “lock” to be removed, putting pensioners at the mercy of the rampant greed of companies exploiting international issues as an excuse to raise prices and fatten profits.\nAbandoning the triple lock would almost certainly mean a loss of around £12,000 a year for pensioners over the course of their retirement.\nAnd it’s not as if these cuts are being made to a generous base. British pensions are already woefully inadequate to meet the needs of our pensioners.\nAccording to a recent report by the Centre for Ageing Better, in the 12 months up to March this year, another 200,000 pensioners fell into poverty.\nThe threat to the triple lock comes against a backdrop in which Britain already has one of the worst pension provisions for its older people out of any major EU country.\nA 2022 government report pointed out that even once state and private pensions were aggregated, Britain had lower than average pension earnings, compared to previous income, than the average EU country. The EU average state pension is 63 per cent of working earnings — and almost 60 per cent among wider OECD nations.\nIn Britain it is barely a quarter. After decades of working-age hardship, with real-terms earnings drastically reduced under the Tories, even with the triple lock, British pensions are a woefully inadequate pittance.\nAt the same time, governments have pushed pensions later and later — particularly for the “Waspi women” born in the 1950s, many of whom have been forced into real hardship and chaos, with the retirement at 60 that they were promised and planned for delayed until 66.\nThese inequalities are not just unfair, they are lethal — there is now a huge difference in life expectancy of around a decade between the better off and those struggling. If we look at healthy life expectancy, it’s double — just under 20 years difference between the poor and the well-off. So, as well as taking years off lives, inequality is robbing people of decades of health.\nThe vast gap between Britain’s pensions and those of other comparable nations shows that low pensions here — like every other decision damaging the lives of millions — are a political choice, not an economic necessity.\nIn fact, it’s even worse than that: it’s purely ideological and it’s actually counterproductive in economic terms, perpetuating a situation that is then used as an excuse for more cuts and greater inequality.\nIt is an ideological attack that enables the richest to go untaxed whilst those who have worked the hardest over the longest period of time, and who are the most vulnerable, become increasingly impoverished.\nIt is important to understand from the outset what the government’s underlying motive is for suspending the triple lock for what would now be, if implemented, three years in a row.\nIt is yet another broken manifesto pledge, marketed and amplified by a compliant media as a “necessary evil” to pull us through a cost-of-living crisis. In reality, the only evil is the betrayal of the British public at every turn.\nIt can only be described as cruelty and malice that this government has hunted for ways in which workers and communities should pay for the crisis, instead of getting the billionaires and millionaires who have flourished since the pandemic to pay up.\nRemoving the triple lock will destroy the value of the state pension, plunging those in old age into poverty. It is obscene to be robing them whilst enriching the wealthiest.\nAs well as causing immeasurable hardship, all these cuts actually damage our economy. It’s a well-known economic principle that each pound of public spending sees a much bigger return in economic activity — around £1.70 for each pound spent — fuelling economic growth. Each pound cut does the reverse, exacerbating economic decline.\nOf course, each pound put into the pocket of people on low incomes goes immediately back into the economy because they are going to spend it, while a pound paid into the coffers of corporations and the wealthy is more likely to end up in an offshore bank account.\nProviding a better standard of living for the millions struggling in Britain would be sound economic sense, growing our economy and creating a virtuous circle of self-perpetuating prosperity that lifts everyone.\nIncome tax rises on the wages of the super-rich, returning corporate taxes to 25 per cent, taxing capital gains and dividend wealth equitably, extending stamp duty on financial transactions to cover more of our deeply risky and over-financialised economy, tackling tax avoidance and evasion, implementing a wealth tax and reviewing tax reliefs and subsidies that only benefit the rich, are just some of the measures the government can take to stave off a winter of discontent when producing its Autumn Statement.\nThe real challenge for the government is to show the political will to make the changes needed to put our country on a genuinely sound economic and ecological footing by redistributing wealth to where it does the most good, helping ordinary people from the youngest to the oldest to enjoy a decent quality of life — and lifting the shame of poverty in a nation that is supposedly one of the world’s richest, but in reality has become a poor country with a small number of very wealthy people.\nThose changes are not complicated. They are not difficult choices to make — as UN special rapporteur for extreme poverty Philip Alston pointed out, when he came to Britain four years ago, it would be easy and inexpensive to fix the fundamental injustices found. But tragically, that political will is almost entirely absent.\nMaintaining the pensions triple lock in this week’s Autumn Statement is essential, but it’s barely even a starting point in what this country needs — and what the government could easily do, if only it chose to.\nIn the absence of political leadership, it will be up to those of us on the left to take the lead — to keep hammering home the arguments, and organising both resistance and an effective media and communications agenda to ensure that the Establishment’s plan to drown out the existence of alternatives is not allowed to succeed.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_shocking-figures-show-sheer-scale-of-child-poverty-in-leicester/content_570.html": "Shocking figures show sheer scale of child poverty in Leicester\nNew figures show that more than half of children in some Leicester neighbourhoods are living in poverty.\nYears of austerity combined with insecure employment mean an estimated 43,677 children in Leicestershire are living below the poverty line even though the vast majority – 30,866 of them – have at least one parent who has a job.\nThe figures are based on data that is about a year old – it is expected that coronavirus has already made the situation much worse.\nIn the Leicester East constituency, no less than 42 per cent of children live under the poverty line – defined by people living of less than 60 per cent of the average household income.\nOne neighbourhood, just to the west of Spinney Hill Park, has a child poverty figure of 51 per cent.\nThe area includes Melbourne Street, Cecil Road, Maynard Road and Wilson Street.\nClaudia Webbe, MP for Leicester East, said the problem was “unacceptable and outrageous”.\nShe said: “I’ve been highlighting this issue for some time. There are high levels of child poverty in Leicester and particularly in my constituency, which is 60 per cent black, Asian and ethnic minority.\n“It’s terrible and this is the product of years of insecure working practices and ideologically-driven austerity.\n“Communities are suffering and in areas like the east of Leicester the inequalities are stark.\n“People are in precarious jobs with no security and children are having to suffer living in poverty-stricken homes as a result.”\nThere are pockets of deprivation throughout the county, with one in every six Leicestershire youngster under 18 living in a household affected by poverty.\nIn the county as a whole, 17 per cent of children live in poverty, with the biggest problem in the city, where 27 per cent live below the poverty line.\nElsewhere, 13 per cent of youngsters in North West Leicestershire live in poverty, as well as 11 per cent in Blaby, nine per cent in Harborough and 12 per cent in each of the other constituencies – Melton, Charnwood, Hinckley and Bosworth, and Oadby and Wigston.\nThe figures show that finding a job is not a guaranteed route out of poverty.\nMs Webbe said a large number of the families living in poverty in her constituency had either one or two working adults but still struggled to make ends meet.\n“We’re mostly talking about the working poor,” she said.\n“Even before the outbreak of coronavirus the working poor had become the norm – they go out to work but come home with insufficient money and often have to chose between eating and heating the house. Many rely on food banks.\n“Even with two parents working it’s sometimes insufficient. There are also unscrupulous employers in some cases.\n“With the current levels of benefits, income is not enough and we should all be ashamed by the inequality – it’s unacceptable and outrageous.\n“After the coronavirus outbreak ends we need a different society going forward.”\nShe said the risks and sacrifices being made by carers, cleaners and other low-paid key workers during the outbreak made it all the more important they get a decent standard of living in the future.\nTo find out child poverty figures in your area, use the online tool below, which sorts neighbourhoods based on postcodes.\nThe data is based on income figures from March 2019 and population figures for mid-2018 and with the coronavirus lockdown affecting local economies everywhere, there are fears the real situation could already be much worse.\nAbu Taher, a long-term resident of the Spinney Hills area from Bangladesh who was awarded an MBE for his charity work in the city in 2003, said an already dire situation was being made much worse by the outbreak.\nHe said: “The Spinney Hills area has many people coming from Third World countries and they can’t find a suitable job and they’re working part-time or in low pay jobs in warehouses and other places that don’t pay enough.\n“It’s been a problem in this area for a long time and even before coronavirus it was rising again over the past two to three years, with more than 40 per cent of all the children in the Leicester East constituency living in poverty.\n“Now we have the pandemic it’s even worse, with businesses closing and jobs going.\n“It’s very hard for these people to find a way to cope.\n“It’s a very worrying moment for us and for everyone.”\nCharities have also warned that child poverty is only going to get worse because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nJudith Cavanagh, coordinator of the End Child Poverty coalition, said: “These figures from the government show the extent to which we have been failing children in poverty even before the outbreak of coronavirus.\n“We have not all entered this crisis equally. Children in poverty will be among the worst affected by the crisis as households see their income hit further, through loss of employment and the increased costs of staying home – such as food, fuel bills and supporting homeschooling.\n“Policies such as the two-child limit on children’s benefits and the benefit cap have made a significant contribution to the rise in child poverty over the past five years.\n“As more families now have to turn to the benefits system as a result of coronavirus we are urging the government to scrap those policies, which they argued acted as incentives to get people into work.\n“We would also like the government to introduce an immediate increase to child benefit of £10 per child as a fast and effective means of getting support to low income families.\n“Children in low income families have been failed over the past 5 years. Our response to Covid-19 must not fail them again.”\nA Department of Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “We are doing whatever it takes to support the lowest paid families through these unprecedented times, implementing an extensive package of measures to do so.\n“Widespread support is available to families, including increased Universal Credit payments, contributory benefits, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Self-employment Income Support Scheme, Statutory Sick Pay, mortgage holidays and greater protection for renters.\n“Despite the challenges of the current pandemic we remain committed to providing opportunities and tackling the root causes of poverty.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_thank-you-jeremy-john-and-diane/content_508.html": "Thank you Jeremy, John and Diane\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nLabour’s recently departed leadership team of Jeremy Corbyn, John Mcdonnel and Diane Abbot stood firmly for socialism against incredible pressures – and history will vindicate them.\nDuring this coronavirus outbreak, I am fighting on behalf of all my constituents in Leicester East to ensure the government is prioritising our public health and safety. We need a collective approach to this crisis, the biggest of our lifetimes, and one which sees a step change in how our public services are valued and funded after a decade of savage cuts. As we tackle this enormous challenge, nobody can be left behind.\nAmid this unprecedented pandemic, it is understandable that the handover of Labour’s leadership was a muted affair. I congratulate our party’s new leader Keir Starmer and wish his shadow cabinet team well in a challenging historical moment. But we should also reflect on the experiences of the past five years.\nThe outgoing triumvirate of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, and Diane Abbott made dignified final performances. In his final PMQs appearance, Jeremy did what he always has done and stood up for cleaners, care workers, frontline NHS staff, private renters, Britons stuck abroad, universal credit claimants, and others in need of justice.\nIn their leadership, both in recent years and during the preceding decades when, time and again, they proved to be on the right side of history. Before they held any position of power, these three led opposition to the disastrous war in Iraq, stood up for migrant rights, and opposed cuts to welfare and the drive towards privatisation and deindustrialisation. They were the lonely but consistent voices of dissent against the upward transfer of wealth and power that has taken place since the late 1970s.\nThe results last December were devastating for all of us who have suffered ten years of Tory rule and know how urgently we need a radical Labour government. But it must never be forgotten that, despite an unprecedented onslaught from the entirety of the British establishment, Jeremy took us incredibly close to victory in 2017, when we secured our largest increase in vote share since 1945 and first net gains in 20 years.\nThat achievement — winning 40 per cent of the voting public to a socialist programme — was remarkable. And we must look to it when asking questions of how we move forward as a party. The 2019 election was largely a Brexit election. We did not lose it because of our policy platform, which was popular and progressive. The shift in political debate on issues around austerity, nationalisation, investment, and public spending are evidence of this, even in the Conservative Party.\nI was proud to be a supporter of Jeremy, John, and Diane’s leadership. In 2015, they took control of a Labour Party that supported austerity, capitulated to right-wing narratives on immigration, and did not offer a genuinely alternative vision for a fairer society.\nTogether, they have reconnected the Labour Party to its socialist routes. Thanks to their campaigning, we are now the biggest left-wing membership party in Europe — and they have inspired a generation of young people to join the political process and fight for their future. Their leadership has demonstrated to us that we don’t have to accept the unjust status quo, that it is possible to fight against systems of oppression, and that — together — we can achieve real change.\nI would also like to pay special tribute to Diane Abbott. When Diane was elected as the first black woman MP in 1987, BAME people only made up 1 per cent of parliamentarians. Today, we count for a record 20 per cent of Labour Party parliamentarians and 10 per cent of all parliamentary members. While we still have much to do, we are indebted to Diane for breaking down many of the barriers facing African, Asian, and minority ethnic women in politics.\nShe is a true giant of the anti-racist movement. Yet the unprecedented level of vile racist and sexist abuse she has endured as shadow home secretary, which accounts for half of all online hate directed at female MPs, shows that we must all recommit to the fight to end the evils of racism and misogyny.\nThe present crisis has shown that the world which Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and Diane Abbott have been fighting for their entire lives is not only possible, it is the only viable option to avoid economic chaos, racist reaction, and climate breakdown. The choice of our era is clear: people and planet, or profit.\nJohn McDonnell, who has done so much to move the dial of economic consensus back towards fundamental human decency, was entirely correct with his final words as shadow chancellor in Parliament: ‘It is solidarity that will see us through this crisis, protect our community, and on which we should build our society in the future.’\nThis crisis has shown us how deeply we depend on one another. We will come through this as a society only through a huge collective effort. As Jeremy said in his final parliamentary appearance as leader; ‘At times like this … we have to recognise the value of each other and the strength of a society that cares for each other and cares for all.’\nI hope that Keir Starmer, as Labour leader, will protect these principles of empathy, decency and the belief in our collective ability to build a better world. In an age of crises, which have decimated the political ‘centre-ground’, we on the left must not abandon the compassionate, principled radicalism of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, and Diane Abbott.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_granting-more-oil-and-gas-licences-is-an-act-of-climate-destruction/content_187.html": "Granting more oil and gas licences is an act of climate destruction\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nPolitical change away from the profit motive is the only hope of tackling climate change, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIN MARCH this year, as a part of the environmental audit subcommittee on polar research’s inquiry into Britain’s involvement in the Arctic, I visited one of the most northernmost inhabited settlements in the world, Ny-Alesund, a scientific research station, located on the island of Spitsbergen, which is part of the Svalbard archipelago in Norway, where we examined glaciers and snowfall, and heard from scientists about the grim crisis facing our planet.\nI came away from that visit more convinced than ever that the crisis, or even our hope of mitigating the emergency, requires socialist solutions — and that capitalism is incompatible with the future of our planet and species.\nClimate change is an urgent global crisis that demands immediate and collective action of the kind that will never take place under a profit-driven system.\nThe extent of Arctic ice in summer is reducing by almost 13 per cent per decade, according to the latest observations — the fastest rate in the world — putting extreme stress on the ecosystem and on species and wildlife, such as polar bears, which rely on it for hunting and movement.\nIn addition to the direct impact on species, the reduction in ice coverage is itself fuelling an acceleration in warming, as less summer ice means less of the sun’s heat is reflected back into space and more is absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere.\nThe same situation extends to the other pole. Antarctica is experiencing a “five-sigma” level fall in its sea ice — a level of loss that should only happen once every 7.5 million years and one from which the continent has failed to make the winter recovery that scientists normally expect and hope to see.\n2023 saw an all-time low in Antarctic sea ice — beating previous lows in 2016, 2017 and 2022.\nThe usual cycle of thaw and freeze at both poles drives vital ocean currents that help regulate climate in other parts of the globe, as well as transporting nutrients on which other ocean environments rely.\nThe potential collapse of these cycles will be catastrophic for species at the poles and elsewhere around the planet — including ours.\nThe harms of global warming are not only being felt at the poles. Developing nations are seeing what used to be considered freak weather extremes of flood and drought becoming more and more frequent, killing thousands and putting harvests, natural resources and national infrastructure in even greater danger.\nExtreme heatwaves are driving wildfires across Europe as well as directly threatening the lives of vulnerable people, while the melting of Arctic permafrost accelerates and could release billions of tonnes of methane into the atmosphere.\nThe US state of Florida is experiencing sea temperatures that have smashed previous records — and scientists believe that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which is crucial to the vital Gulf Stream current that circulates the Atlantic Ocean water from south to north, could collapse in as little as two years.\nWithin a century the US could see tens of millions people forced to flee rising sea levels and climate extremes that make them unsustainable — hundreds of millions across the world, with some island nations facing complete submersion.\nHuman activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, is driving Earth’s rising temperatures to catastrophic effect. Yet governments do little but make promises that barely last past the press conference to announce them at the same time as they vie for control of polar resources to exploit and, in this country, both the government and the opposition have begun to talk about the primacy of cost over effectiveness in curbing emissions.\nClimate change disproportionately affects the poor and those living in marginalised communities. Environmental justice is vital to ensure that those who contribute least to climate change do not suffer its harshest consequences and are not bypassed by proposed solutions.\nYet what solutions the international community has floated until now are primarily driven by the needs of wealthy nations and deprive those communities worst affected by the climate emergency of a voice, while colonial attitudes still permeate the continued theft of natural resources and the victims of this theft are penalised further by the destruction of their environment.\nMeasures to prevent or restrict corporate pillaging and pollution amount to little more than tokens, while national targets are abandoned or delayed by governments more concerned with corporate bottom lines and keeping shareholders happy.\nNone of this is going to change as long as we allow companies, with their horizons that extend little further than the next financial quarter, not only to hold the means of production but also to hold an unhealthy influence over the development and deployment of technologies that can slow and eventually, we hope, reverse the climate crisis.\nUniversities and other academic institutions play a leading role in developing new technologies, materials and processes that can replace those that are driving the emergency.\nBut all too often, when these processes and technologies are developed, they are farmed out by governments or even the universities themselves to profit-driven corporations — whose perceived interests can easily lie in suppressing the new developments in order to maximise profits from existing processes and extraction, instead of accelerating the rollout of the new to help fight climate change.\nThe lie that “the market,” or profit-driven corporations with their ethos of “shareholder value” can be the solution for the climate emergency is easily exposed by even a glance at Britain’s privatised water industry, that has doled out billions in dividends while building up debt, yet now claims it needs to increase charges on ordinary people to fund the improvements it should have been making all along — or at the energy giants profiteering and seeking new oil and gas fields to exploit instead of investing in climate-friendly sources.\nEven as I write, the government has granted over 100 new gas and oil licences, claiming that it is necessary to power up Britain and for energy security. In my view, this is a lie, in reality, this is an act of climate destruction, it’s fossil fuel capitalism in all but name.\nInstead of the madness of continuing to do what has always been done and hoping for different outcomes, political change is the only hope of tackling climate change and therefore it is right that we campaign hard for that change and take every urgent and radical action.\nInstead of putting wealth and resources in the hands of companies accountable only to shareholders, the people must hold the means, not only of production but also of development.\nWe must prioritise public ownership and democratic control over energy resources and technological resources to end the influence of profit-driven industries in all sectors of national and international importance.\nPublicly funded research and development is already driving advancements in renewable and environmentally friendly technologies and materials, but that is not enough — their deployment must also be in the hands of the people and those directly accountable to them.\nIf the profit motive is removed, then sane priorities can be set that put the survival of humanity and planet first — and the new industries and the technologies that drive them will generate good for all instead of fattening the bank accounts of the already obscenely wealthy and power-hungry.\nIn such an environment, we can create large-scale, decentralised renewable energy generation and other infrastructure that serves the needs of everyone rather than corporate interests — a resilient energy and production system that can be sustained over centuries instead of lurching over the climate tipping point.\nIf there is to be a just transition that ensures that people and their communities are not left behind, it must be controlled and managed by the people, not by politicians in corporate pockets, to protect workers’ rights and make sure that comprehensive support is provided to retrain and financially support workers affected by the move away from a carbon-intensive economy.\nAnd the needs of all the world’s people must be fundamental to this shift. Developing nations must be supported and empowered in structuring their solutions to fit local needs and build equitable economies that help rather than damage the planet — and collective bargaining and action must be protected and promoted instead of the ideological war currently being waged on them.\nClimate change is an existential threat to humanity and our planet. The ending of capitalism is not only an ideological or political aim but an absolute necessity for ending that threat.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_local-elections-were-a-disaster-for-the-tories-and-bad-news-for-labour/content_334.html": "Local elections were a disaster for the Tories – and bad news for Labour\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nAfter 14 years of Tory rule there’s little enthusiasm for Starmer and his menu of reheated Thatcherism, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE\nLAST WEEK’S local election results were widely and rightly portrayed as a disaster for the Conservatives and a sign that Britain is desperate for change.\nRishi Sunak’s party lost more than half the seats it was trying to hold, along with a slew of councils and mayoral contests — and lost heavily even in mayoral contests it managed to defend, such as Tees Valley. But in fact, the Tories only went backward slightly in terms of overall vote share compared to their already-poor performance, with “national equivalent vote” predictions putting the Tories on 27 per cent.\nBut while the results showed clearly that British voters want change, there was no landslide to Labour. While Keir Starmer’s party picked up seats, according to political scientist John Curtice, the party went backwards compared to a year ago and recent polling giving Labour as much as 47 per cent of the Westminster vote turned into a projected 34 per cent when voters went to the actual ballot box, just 7 per cent ahead of the Tories. On the equivalent measure, Tony Blair’s Labour was more than 20 points ahead of the Tories in 1995, before the 1997 general election landslide.\nLabour managed to gain barely more seats than the Independents, whose proportional gains were far greater, as were those of the Greens. Labour managed to scrape the West Midlands mayoral contest by a mere 1,500 votes — against a Tory Party in collapse — but also lost control in Oldham and Kirklees and lost seats in other areas to Independents.\nEven worse for Keir Starmer, Westminster voting calculations based on the results projected that Labour will fall more than 30 seats short of an overall parliamentary majority, leaving him scrabbling to find coalition partners or running a minority government.\nSo what went wrong for Starmer’s Labour? The Tories’ woes of corruption, incompetence and loss of trust are well documented. Voters only need to look around them to see the damage caused by 14 years of Tory policies and cuts that have left millions in grinding poverty while a few have made billions. Too many will remember for part of this, the Liberal Democrats were in bed with them, between 2010 and 2015, as part of a coalition government.\nBut if one were to believe the media narrative of the past couple of years, Starmer was riding a wave toward a landslide victory and an unassailable Commons majority. That claim now looks exposed, with a general election only months away.\nThe most obvious and current issue is that of Starmer’s position on Gaza and his support for Israel despite its genocidal assault on Palestinians — most notoriously, telling radio station LBC that he backed Israel’s “right” to cut off food, water and fuel from more than two million civilians, half of them women and children.\nHis attempts to backtrack only led to an even greater loss of trust, as he tried to claim he hadn’t said what he was recorded on camera saying and only did even that after sending out front-bench MPs to defend his words. It failed to prevent widespread outrage and disgust, particularly but far from exclusively among Muslim voters. His refusal to support a ceasefire until he had an opportunity to steal the SNP’s thunder on their opposition day motion, debate and vote, ground the damage even deeper.\nBut Labour’s issues with Muslim and black communities go back much further than October 7. In the Batley and Spen by-election in 2021, Labour reacted to fears that it would lose the election by claiming that the constituency’s Muslims were voting against Labour because they objected to Starmer’s purge of “anti-semites,” telling the right-wing newspaper publication the Mail that the “toxic” voter backlash was because of “what Keir has been doing on anti-semitism.”\nEven before that, in late 2020, the Labour Muslim Network (LMN) issued a report condemning Labour’s lack of seriousness in tackling Islamophobia and reported that well over half of Muslim members did not trust Starmer to “tackle the issue effectively.” Purges of black and Muslim councillors, Starmer’s failure to protect Apsana Begum and his eagerness to condemn the Black Lives Matter protesters added to the deep sense of distrust.\nAnd Starmer’s loss of trust goes wider still. After winning the party leadership contest with a set of pledges and a promise to maintain Jeremy Corbyn’s policy platform, he has dumped every pledge and rejected every opportunity to commit to any policies that would help to fix the mess that Britain is in after almost a decade and a half of Tory rule. He has said that Labour in government will not bring back refugees deported to Rwanda. He has even praised Thatcher for her destruction of Britain’s industry and social cohesion, which he called “meaningful change” — but he doesn’t offer any change, at least any for the better.\nStarmer has said he will not, as he had promised, nationalise vital industries like energy and water. After promising to bring the NHS fully back into public hands, he and Wes Streeting have said they will widen the use of private corporations in our health service — and after years of underinvestment in the NHS, they say they will not restore health spending to what it should be, instead promising yet more “reform.”\nInstead of a mass programme of council housebuilding and caps on rents to prevent impoverishment and exploitation, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says she and her boss plan to make Labour “the party of home ownership.” The pair have also indicated that there would be no funding boost to fill the gaping hole in local government finances that has pushed council after council into bankruptcy and hit their most vulnerable residents hardest.\nAnd of course, most shamefully of all — at least in domestic policy terms — Starmer has committed to maintaining the two-child benefit cap that has pushed hundreds of thousands of children into poverty, hunger and damaged life chances, a cap that costs billions more to keep than to scrap.\nLabour has made clear it is not going to tax the rich to fund investment in public services and infrastructure. Starmer’s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has told the Atlantic Council that Labour will increase military spending to 2.5 per cent of the UK’s gross domestic product. And unions are again being betrayed, with the one decent policy that Labour was offering — a package of renewed workers’ rights — being watered down to please big business and rich donors.\nIt is my argument that the our country is certainly sick of Tory government, wearied and threadbare after years of cuts, underfunding and privatisation. The Tories are discredited, dysfunctional and dishonest and most of the people see it. But Starmer isn’t offering real hope of anything, but more of the same. He isn’t offering a vision of what our country could and should look like and how much better things can be. Instead, we get tepid managerialism that only really warms up when he is defending what most of us find abhorrent.\nAdd to that the horror and disgust millions feel at his and his front bench’s defence of the indefensible, their support for the slaughter of innocent men, women and children in Gaza, and many simply cannot hold their nose and vote Labour “to get the Tories out” and are turning to other parties and to Independents.\nLast week showed us that enough might be willing to hold their nose for Starmer to scrape into Downing Street, but that there is no enthusiasm for the rewarmed Thatcherism Starmer appears to stand for.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-need-to-work-together-to-make-sure-leicester-is-not-the-sweatshop-of-europe/content_674.html": "After this crisis, Leicester must no longer be known as ‘the sweatshop of Europe’\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe existence of sweatshops fuelling the ‘fast fashion’ industry has recently been brought to light again by a flurry of reports concerning the terrible and illegal treatment of many workers in the garment industry in Leicester.\nLeicester has one of the largest numbers of garment workers in the UK. At the last count, there were an estimated 1,500 garment manufacturing businesses in the city employing around 10,000 people, the majority of whom are women from African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nThese sweatshops under-report hours, which means their books look as if they employ someone for 15 hours at a legal wage when they actually employ them for 40 hours at much lower rates. A 2019 study by HMRC found that, over a six-year period, a quarter of all UK textile factories caught failing to pay the minimum wage were based in Leicester, with some textile factories reportedly offering less than £3.50 an hour.\nFactory overcrowding is also commonplace, and with a lack of personal, protective equipment has undoubtedly contributed to the Covid-19 outbreak in the area – a direct result of unscrupulous employers not meeting any legal obligations in the pursuit of ‘fast fashion’.\nMany of these garment factories are key parts of the supply chains of well-known brands. To give one example, a report last month by the labour rights organisation, Labour Behind the Label entitled ‘Boohoo & Covid-19: The people behind the profits’ found “emerging evidence indicates that conditions in Leicester’s factories, primarily producing for Boohoo, are putting workers at risk of Covid-19 infections and fatalities”.\nDespite these ongoing revelations, the Conservative government continues to show that they will always put the interests of private profit ahead of working people, through complete denial of its role in the existence of abusive workplace practices. At Prime Minister’s Question Time on July 8th, Boris Johnson sought to shirk responsibility for the exploitation of workers in Leicester’s garment industry and direct blame towards the local City Mayor and Labour-run city.\nBut the reality is that his government has known about this abuse of workers for years, and rejected the warnings and recommendations of a 2019 environmental audit committee report into this issue and before that the 2017 report Human Rights and Business: Promoting responsibility and ensuring accountability.\nIn one of a number of warnings that have been proven correct, the environmental audit committee heavily criticised online-only ‘fast fashion’ retailers, which are amongst the worst offenders when it comes to unethical practices. Its recommendations – which could have made a real difference – included having minimal levels of ethical and sustainability standards.\nPriti Patel has dangerously and falsely claimed “cultural sensitivities” prevented robust investigation into these Leicester factories, while neglecting to mention austerity cuts to HMRC, the Heath and Safety Executive and other enforcement agencies, as well as cuts to local authorities and the sustained Tory attacks on unions and workers’ rights. The Tory government has also overseen a mushrooming of insecure working practices, including zero-hour contracts.\nThere is real anger and dismay from many that the government has long been aware of instances of worker exploitation but failed to act. We should not be silenced or distracted by their political games. And it is important to ask why people go to work in such conditions.\nMany British workers in Leicester have no other local employment options other than the garment industry, especially since the decimation of the city’s manufacturing base by Thatcherism. Many have been working in this industry since long before the introduction by the 1997 Labour government of the minimum wage.\nThere are also specific issues when it comes to migrants and refugees. The continued ‘no recourse to public funds’ rule for migrants pushes people into exploitative labour, locking them out from receiving vital state support. And people seeking asylum in Britain currently do not have the right to work, instead being expected to live on £5.66 per day.\nThese are examples of policies that push people into exploitative and unsafe labour to survive, and they are a toxic part of the government’s failed ‘hostile environment’ approach to immigration. As one worker said: “If the government made sure everyone got enough money to survive during the pandemic, no-one would come into the factories.” The government should immediately suspend NRPF conditions on public health and humanitarian grounds, and lift the ban on asylum seekers working legally.\nAny analysis of the impact of ‘fast fashion’ must take account of the environmental impact, including of making the fabric, shipping the item and often burying it in landfill. We also need to act as ethical consumers, recognising that we all have a responsibility to protect the workers who make the clothes we wear.\nHowever, our central demand as socialists must be for sectoral collective bargaining to raise wages, reduce inequality, prevent the undercutting of terms and conditions, enable effective enforcement of rights and more importantly enable the voices of workers to be heard.\nLeicester’s garment industry crisis is a microcosm of the assault on workers’ rights, and this situation demonstrates why protecting everyone in our society – and our planet – is the only just way forward. After this crisis, Leicester can no longer be known as ‘the sweatshop of Europe’. The government must now tackle the widespread issues of underpayment and unsafe working conditions.\nChange in this area – and from the ‘fast fashion’ companies themselves – will only come from organisation, clear demands and publicly shaming those exploiting people. We can no longer tolerate billionaire company owners making vast profits on the back of the working class. The time has come to put people and health before private profit – that means decent jobs, workers’ rights and an end to exploitative labour.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_has-the-world-learned-anything-from-the-rana-plaza-disaster/content_200.html": "Has the world learned anything from the Rana Plaza Disaster?\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nA decade ago over 1,000 garment workers were killed due to the demands of fast fashion and greedy brands. We have the power here in Britain to change the system everywhere, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP.\nTen years ago today, more than 1,100 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured when the eight-storey Rana Plaza building collapsed in Bangladesh.\nCorruption and greed were identified as the key causes. The building had been built on unstable ground on a filled-in pond, with substandard materials and with eight floors instead of the four for which the developer had permits.\nThese dangerous working conditions are not new and workers have always been the ones to face the cost. Over a century earlier, in 1911, 146 garment workers died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City, while just a few years before the Rana Plaza collapse, in 2005, the Spectrum building just a few miles away collapsed, killing 64 workers and injuring 80.\nRana Plaza’s owner was sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison for corrupt practices but the trial of him and another 40 people for murder has still not concluded.\nThe collapse did not come without warning. The day before, cracks had been found in the building’s structure and it was evacuated, but the next morning garment workers on the building’s upper floors were forced back into work under threat of being docked a month’s wages if they did not return. Those killed included the children of some of the workers.\nThe disaster was the worst in the history of the garment industry and highlighted the fundamental flaws of a global fashion procurement system that exploits workers and intrinsically drives corruption and unsafe practices as greedy fashion brands and retailers maximise their profits.\nBut has the world learned anything from the catastrophe, let alone made the changes needed to prevent more deaths and put right injustice?\nThe fast fashion industry demands rapid delivery of low-cost clothing to meet ever-changing trends and uses a complex and often opaque global supply chain.\nAt one end of this chain are big brands and the retailers who sell their products. At the other end are workers toiling in often appalling conditions for poverty wages.\nClearly, this situation bears an inherent power imbalance. Brands and retailers with their huge spending power exploit their position to drive down costs and increase profits, while suppliers scramble to compete and in turn, exploit those working for them.\nThis ensures gross inequality for the people working to make clothing for the global North. Workers receive just 0.6 per cent of the profit generated by the garments they produce — factory owners make 4 per cent, but brands make 12 per cent and the retailers a huge 59 per cent.\nThe pressure this situation creates on the manufacturers to cut corners makes corruption and unsafe working environments and practices almost inevitable, with appalling consequences for workers. The pandemic made things even worse, with brands exploiting the crisis to drive down costs even further.\nGross gender inequality, sexism and structural misogyny are also built into the system. Most garment workers are women and girls, who not only disproportionately suffer poor wages and working conditions but are often subject to sexual harassment and exploitation.\nBut has the industry — or indeed the world — learned anything? The answer, predictably and tragically, appears to be no.\nThree years after thousands were killed and injured at Rana Plaza, an NYU Stern investigation found that of the almost 3,500 factories in Bangladesh required to make changes to improve safety, the number that had actually implemented them was just eight.\nIn this country, indeed in my own Leicester East constituency, similar exploitation and abuse are found in garment factories and other workplaces, where workers are still to this day paid less than the minimum wage, work in exploitative conditions, often on zero-hours contracts, where bullying is the norm, making garments for fast fashion brands and retailers, and in factories where unionisation is actively discouraged.\nLabour and workplace inspections are few, poorly funded and powerless and there is no deterrent.\nThe corruption and callousness do not just exist among exploitative business owners. The Grenfell Tower fire should have been the trigger for a rapid mass clean-up of the corruption and greed in the British construction industry.\nInstead, the government has largely sat on its hands, talking tough but doing far too little to fund, or force developers to pay for, the removal of cladding that could cause another Grenfell Tower at any time and leaving residents still at risk of heavy costs for removal.\nAs a result, almost six years after the disaster, almost 10,000 buildings are still covered in flammable cladding and almost the only success against a company installing the cladding was a civil action against a supplier that cost the guilty company almost £11 million to settle.\nIn the garment industry, the British government still does not require companies to audit the safety and well-being of workers producing their fashion brands and has ignored calls for a garment industry watchdog, including my parliamentary petition (early day motion 286), last year calling for the law to be changed to implement a garment trade adjudicator or fashion watchdog, to force brands, retailers and multinational companies to act properly, and put people and planet before profit.\nInstead, fashion businesses claim to follow a voluntary system of “social audits” that the University of Aberdeen described last year as inadequate.\nA survey this year by the same university of 1,000 Bangladeshi suppliers found that the situation has become worse, not better: many major high-street fashion brands are now paying suppliers less than the cost of production.\nIn such a situation, it’s inevitable that employers will cut more corners. Workers are not earning enough to live and there is simply no way that employers will be spending money to make buildings, machinery and working practices safe.\nThere have been some small successes. The Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety have made some advances, but the overall structure of the global supply chain has not only remained unimproved but has become worse.\nCompetitive pressure, corruption, dangerous working conditions and lack of proper inspection and enforcement remain endemic.\nGiven the failure of brands, retailers and governments to take meaningful action to protect workers and end exploitation and injustice, those who care about improving the lives of workers need to turn the capitalist system on itself.\nWhile the brands and retailers may hold the power within the supply chain, it’s arguable those of us who live in wealthy countries, consuming celebrity advertisements, and buying what they sell, hold even greater power if we choose to organise and use it.\nIf enough people refuse to buy clothes — or any other item — that cannot be shown to have been ethically, sustainably and safely produced with a fair, living wage to the workers who made them, brands and retailers will have no choice but to use their power in the supply chain to make those things a reality.\nWe also need to use our political power collectively, demanding of politicians that they tackle corruption and human rights abuses and take effective action against those within their jurisdiction who are directly and indirectly guilty of them.\nGovernments must improve laws and make new ones where needed, to protect all workers including informal workers and whistleblowers adequately.\nIn particular, laws must protect and empower women and children, who are all too often victims of the exploitation and injustice endemic in these industries.\nIn Britain and other countries, we must demand that governments force companies to meet national and international employment standards, including responsibility for their supply chain. Corruption must be identified and properly punished.\nAchieving this is not possible for individuals and it will not happen by chance or by some incidental groundswell of awareness and anger happening to lead the public away from the purchase of unjust products.\nAs socialists, we know it will only be achieved through collective awareness and collective action. People will not become aware without concerted, directed campaigns to inform them — and direct action to make media, governments and businesses take notice.\nArguably, workers have no control over the global supply chain, but one of the few and only material basis for working-class unification is the power of unions and the ability of workers to take control of the means of production.\nAs the Rana Plaza disaster shows, we cannot do this piecemeal; the global supply chain is huge, from the cotton fields to the factories. This requires our collective international solidarity and global concerted effort.\nInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. As socialists we must not rest while the global majority is exploited, abused and all too often killed to feed corporate greed and imperialism.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_anger-over-city-cuts-to-special-needs-transport/content_307.html": "Anger over city cuts to special needs transport\nA UNION has said a consultation exercise run by Leicester City Council on cutting post-16 special educational needs (Send) transport was inadequate and must be re-run.\nUnison claimed the council announced the plans to implement significant cuts to the service for pupils aged 16 to 19 after a “deeply flawed” consultation process held over two years ago.\nIt said the proposals formed part of a worrying trend of Send cuts, which it claimed were implemented with “little meaningful consultation with those most affected, in this case, the students themselves and their families”.\nIt claimed that the council had repeatedly ignored its offer to work with it to campaign for more funding from the Conservative government to save struggling public services.\nIn response to the claims, a city council spokesman said the authority had carried out a wide-ranging three-month consultation and would not be re-running it.\nUnison claimed the decision to withdraw the funding was made following a consultation held in 2021.\nAt the time, it said, the council sought views from more than 700 affected families, and received nine responses, or 1.2 per cent.\nIt claimed that none of the responses came from Send students themselves, who, it said, were “seemingly not included” in the discussion, with correspondence being targeted only at parents and/or carers.\nIt also claimed the consultation was targeted at families who were in the Send transport system at the time it was run.\nNow, more than two years later, additional families requiring Send transport had not had the same opportunity to express their views, it said.\nThe union further claimed the content of the consultation was deficient, claiming none of the questions asked “even touched on the core issue of whether or not the changes would prevent or impede post-16 Send students from accessing education”.\nUnison said those alleged flaws seriously undermined the conclusions drawn from the consultation, and cast doubt upon exactly what the impact of the changes would be. The union declared it was calling upon the council to run another, more comprehensive, consultation, and maintain current funding levels while it was ongoing.\nParents who have been fighting the changes agreed with the union’s claim that consultation on the proposals was inadequate as they gathered in Town Hall Square to protest on Thursday evening.\nIt followed an announcement earlier this year by then assistant city mayor for education, Councillor Vi Dempster, that the “difficult decision” to end school transport funding for young people over 16 with special education needs and disabilities had been made as a result of massive government cuts to city council funding, alongside huge rises in the cost of social care.\nTom Barker, a Unison steward at Ash Field Academy, said: “The actions of Leicester City Council threaten to prevent Send students from being able to attend school – something which is a statutory requirement.\n“At the very least, the council needs to re-run the consultation in a more comprehensive way, so that it can properly understand the true impact of these changes before making a final decision.\n“We need to develop a serious strategy to prevent vital services like these from being cut.\n“But once again Leicester City Council is claiming there is nothing to be done.”\nA council spokesman said: “We carried out a three-month consultation exercise which included writing to all parents and carers with a child over 14 years old who had an Education and Care Plan, not just those already using post-16 Send transport.\n“The proposals were also shared with head teachers, the Local Parent Carer Forum, and The Big Mouth Forum, which is made up exclusively of young people with special education needs.\n“The policy change was then clearly displayed on the council’s web pages about Send transport.\n“Although we extended the funding beyond April, when it was due to finish, to the end of the summer term, the policy is in place and has been implemented, so there will be no further consultation.\n“Due to years of government cuts to our funding, we will find it very hard next year to fund any service that is not legally required of us.\n“If the government decided to make it mandatory for councils to provide this funding, it would also have to pay for it as a new financial burden, which we would welcome. At present there is no indication this will happen.”\nAt the very least, the council needs to re-run the consultation in a more comprehensive way.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-must-oppose-the-governments-slide-towards-authoritarianism/content_657.html": "We must oppose the government’s slide towards authoritarianism\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThat the Tories wish to grant undercover agents more power to infiltrate well-meaning activist groups is an issue of grave importance which should concern us all, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nI FEAR that under cover of its catastrophic handing of the coronavirus, our government is embarking on a dangerous slide towards authoritarianism.\nAfter all, this is a government which openly broke international law by breaking its election promises over Brexit; which recently passed a Bill granting immunity to soldiers who committed crimes over five years ago, and which has embarked on a worrying war of words against “lefty lawyers,” which is nothing more than a coded culture war against those defending our human rights.\nLast week I was proud to vote against the government’s latest dangerous piece of legislation which could legalise brutal crimes committed in secret by undercover agents.\nThe Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) Bill gives several state agencies the powers to authorise their covert sources to commit crimes if it is thought to be necessary and proportionate in the circumstances.\nUnlike similar formalising legislation in countries including the US and Canada, this Bill does not place any limits whatsoever on the types of crimes that can be committed while undercover.\nThere are therefore concerns that it could potentially issue a “licence to kill” for operatives and risks decriminalising murder, torture or sexual assault.\nTrade unions, human rights and civil liberties campaigners — including Reprieve, Privacy International and the Joint Committee on Human Rights — have expressed concerns about the worryingly wide scope of the Bill, as well as its limited oversight and the consequences for human rights standards.\nIndeed, I am concerned that these powers will be granted to a sweeping list of government agencies, including the Food Standards Agency, the Gambling Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority — hardly organisations usually associated with life-or-death operations.\nI am especially worried that one of the three conditions guiding covert illegal actions by the British state is whether they are “in the interests of the economic well-being of the UK.”\nSadly, I do not have faith in this government of the super-rich to fairly determine what is in the economic interest of our country. Not after they have presided over 10 years of brutal austerity, declining living standards and an upwards transfer of wealth to the 1 per cent.\nOne need simply to look at the fact that this government recently prohibited schools from using any resources from anti-capitalist groups, to realise that this has all the trappings of yet another authoritarian attempt to silence left-wing critique of our drastically unequal society.\nThis is especially alarming when we consider which groups have historically been targeted by undercover agents of the British state.\nAccording to information disclosed as part of the 2017 undercover policing inquiry, it was revealed that of the more than 1,000 groups targeted by undercover police in the last five decades, just three belonged to the far right.\nThe vast majority hailed from the left and included trade unionists, anti-racists and climate activists.\nThe recent “spycops” scandal revealed harrowing instances of morally indefensible undercover interference in activist groups.\nPeter Francis, formerly an undercover cop in the Met’s Special Demonstrations Squad (SDS), has admitted to infiltrating and spying on five national trade unions, in addition to anti-racist movements, justice campaigns, socialist groups and environmental activists.\nPerhaps most shockingly, the Met Police recently apologised for the actions of undercover cop Bob Lambert, who fathered a child with a woman he deceitfully met during a covert mission in the 1980s.\nThe police were forced to pay compensation to the son he deserted at two years old.\nYet the deep trauma of his victim, who declared that she felt as if she had been “raped by the state,” will likely never disappear.\nAnd what was this woman’s crime, which warranted an undercover policeman infiltrating her life to such a traumatic extent?\nIn her own words: “I gave out a few leaflets, went on a few demos, but I wasn’t a bad person.”\nThis is hardly a dangerous criminal who deserves such awfully life-altering state surveillance.\nFamilies seeking justice have also been victims of covert operations, including the Hillsborough families throughout their struggle to reveal the truth of police and government cover-ups.\nShockingly, the family of Stephen Lawrence were also spied on by undercover officers as they campaigned for the police to properly investigate the racist murder of their son.\nThe fact that this hard-right government wishes to grant undercover agents more power to infiltrate well-meaning activist groups is an issue of grave importance which should concern us all.\nThis is the second controversial piece of legislation which the government has put through in recent weeks, after the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill.\nThat legislation ensured that acts of torture committed by British service personnel could not be prosecuted if they took place more than five years ago.\nMany human rights groups, including Amnesty International, Freedom From Torture, Liberty, and Rights Watch UK, strongly opposed this Bill on the grounds that it contravenes international humanitarian and human rights law.\nA worrying pattern is emerging. The Overseas Operations Bill enshrines immunity for horrific crimes abroad while the other provides cover for state crimes committed against UK residents.\nIt is alarming that this is the “global Britain” promised in such glowing words by the Prime Minister and his allies over the last few years.\nA Britain which alienates itself on the world stage and which is driven by a tub-thumping form of nationalist authoritarianism that endangers our citizens, our armed forces and civilians around the globe.\nInstead we must strive for a Britain in which none of our citizens go hungry, that is a welcoming place for everyone and a force for good at home and abroad.\nIt is up to all of us on the left to continue the struggle to achieve this better world.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

I support Black Lives Matter and therefore support what she was doing.\n“As a member of Parliament, I stand in full solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and I stand with her work in the Black Lives Matter movement.”\nIn a series of posts on Twitter surrounding the incident, the MP expressed concerns around violence saying: “There are still too many guns and violent weapons damaging too many lives”.\nSasha achieved a first-class degree in Social Care at Oxford University and works within activism and community support.\nOn the TTIP website, her dedicated page describes her as having an “immense passion for implementing change and justice”.\n“Although not everyone may agree with her methods, she is not afraid to stand up for what she believes in.\n“She is also committed to feeding the homeless and has personally been involved in delivering food and groceries to families that are in need,” the websites states.\nAn appeal was later issued by the Metropolitan Police for witnesses to the shooting of a 27-year-old woman, although they were unable to confirm if it was the incident involving Ms Johnson.\nThe Met said the woman was in hospital with life-threatening injuries after being shot.\nShe was found after officers were called to reports of gunshots in Consort Road, Peckham, South East London, shortly before 3am.\nIt is believed the shooting occurred in the vicinity of a house where a party was taking place and a number of people may have been in the area.\nA spokesman said that while the investigation is at an early stage, there is nothing to suggest it was a targeted attack or that the woman had received any credible threats against her before this incident.\nDetectives from the Met’s specialist crime command (Trident) are leading the investigation.\nDetective Chief Inspector Jimi Tele said: “This was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time.”\nHe said detectives are making “good progress” in hunting the attackers but they need help from the public.\nIt is “crucial” that anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Consort Road area in the early hours of Sunday or who has heard information since then get in touch.\n“Finally, I recognise that this incident will have shocked those in the local community and further afield,” Detective Tele said. “I would ask people to avoid speculating as to the motive or the circumstances behind it.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

It stayed at a consistent level. Where in the rest of the country it went down, it stayed at a constant level in Leicester until there was a spike,” she said.\n“What people haven’t analysed is why didn’t Leicester’s general data reduce when the rest of the country did back in March?\n“Part of the problem is an online fashion boom and the need for food – Leicester’s industries are composed of both those elements. The government didn’t lock down those industries – there was no reduction in work if anything there was an increase in work.”\n“So we are talking about parts of the city – and in my constituency – where poverty is extremely high. In pockets of the neighbourhood, child poverty is at 51 per cent and income is extremely low £160 less than the national average and £130 less than the east midlands average.\n“People are going to work and still relying on food banks on a daily basis. Then we have small, terraced housing where there is overcrowding. And, on top of that, you have the issue to do with the garment factories – surely without PPE and without social distancing they must be contributing to the problem.”\nLast week, it emerged that some factories making up Leicester’s textile industry doubled their staff to cope with a surge in online orders – with employees claiming they were forced to work without social distancing measures or protective gear.\nUpdate on local lockdown expected\nMs Webb continued: “And, due to the NRPF issue, you have got people having to work because they are having no financial or economic support. There are huge parts of my constituency that aren’t entitled to the Government’s Covid-19 financial support – they aren’t entitled to sick pay, holiday pay, relief on rent or relief on their mortgage.\n“Given this scenario why can’t all this be looked at as a factor int he Government decision because this all creates a perfect storm. And my constituency is the last place where you want the virus to take off given 69 per cent of it is from African, Asian and minority ethnic communities which we know to be more vulnerable.\n“If this is going to work it has to protect livelihoods and secure for people an income.”\nShe added: “Unless the gov steps and does what they don’t want to do – like release things like NRPF – then you cant begin to address this problem, people need to be protected to stay safe.\n“There is nothing more important than life itself.”\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock is due to make an “important statement” providing a coronavirus update on Thursday evening.\nLeicester’s mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, has urged the Government to lift the local lockdown in 90 per cent of the city – and warned that a further two-week extension would leave residents “very angry indeed”.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-people-of-brazil-must-know-they-do-not-stand-alone/content_329.html": "The people of Brazil must know they do not stand alone\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nAt the time of writing (August 26), Brazil has the second most cases (3,622,861) and deaths (115,309) from Coronavirus in the world.\nMany health experts believe these already horrendous figures are a massive under-reporting of the real situation.\nDespite this devastation, Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has continually taken an extreme and dangerous denialist approach to the pandemic, calling it ‘a little flu’ and ‘media hysteria’. In line with his devout devotion to neo-liberalism, Bolsonaro has refused to promote or implement the typical raft of life-saving measures to deal with the crisis.\nIn the country currently there is also a very real risk of further transmission to remote indigenous communities, for whom highly infectious diseases pose a devastating threat.\nRecent figures suggest at least 542 indigenous people have died from COVID-19.\nIn total, more than 16,000 COVID-19 cases have been registered among 143 Indigenous communities, yet Bolsonaro recently vetoed 16 sections of a law that would have required the government to provide drinking water, disinfectants, and hospital beds for Indigenous people during the pandemic.\nBrazil’s national indigenous organisation the APIB has described as “humiliating” the government approach to the pandemic among indigenous peoples, and has said that “The disease affects every day thousands of indigenous people in the region who live in and outside traditional territories.”\nOn June 30, the organization also went to court to attempt to force the regime to take measures to protect the indigenous population. The petition, signed by 305 indigenous communities, most of them in the Amazon, urged the government to put in practice an emergency plan to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and save lives.\nThe threats facing these indigenous communities are very real, with the World Health Organization General Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently saying that the “WHO is deeply concerned about the impact of the virus on indigenous peoples in the Americas, which remains the current epicentre of the pandemic.”\nIndigenous communities in Brazil already faced systemic discrimination, economic disadvantage, and limited access to health services before this pandemic, which means its effects are extremely severe.\nThey also face a threat to the places they live in from climate change and the deforestation of the Amazon.\nIn July several environmental organizations filed a request with the Federal Courts of Accounts for an audit on the environmental policies carried out by Bolsonaro´s administration to combat fires in the Amazon, accusing the far-right President of “dismantling of environmental policy” rather than using the resources allocated to this vital cause.\nThis concern has been stoked by the revelations that fires in the Amazon region are increasing, with the first six days of August seeing 5.860 fires recorded, an increase of seven percent compared to the same period last year.\nThe fires increased 28 percent in July in comparison to the same month in 2019 and additionally about 1,000 fires were registered just on July 30, the highest number in a single day since 2005.\nBrazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) science director Ane Alencar has said “September will be even worse.”\nMany of these fires are in areas illegally cleared of forest, meaning that they are a direct result of Bolsonaro’s decisions to actively promote deforestation, and his decision to encourage agricultural and mining activities in the region in line with his hard-line neo-liberal economic policy in what can only be described as a state sanctioned land grab.\nIndeed, even before he was in office, Bolsonaro said he would curb the ability of the country’s environmental protection agency to fine offenders, and this message was received loud and clear by those grabbing land illegally. In the year to last August, forest clearance in the Amazon increased 29 per cent. Yet Bolsonaro kept his word, with the number of fines and sanctions applied by environmental institute Ibama falling dramatically since he assumed office.\nBetween 1 August 2019 and July 31 2020, 9,205 sq km (3,550 square miles) of rainforest were cleared – a rise of 33 per cent compared to the same period in 2018/19.\nMore widely speaking, according to the Climate Observatory’s statement, since Bolsonaro came to power there has been “the veiled closure of the Ministry of Environment, the shelving of plans to fight deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado (savanna) region, the disregard for the Paris Agreement, the harassment of inspectors and the ideological and illegal omission to invest in the fight against environmental crimes, despite a budget of nearly US$ 400 million in unspent funds to do so.”\nResistance to Bolsonaro though is growing across society. In addition to the aforementioned environmental and indigenous groups, there is a growing Black Lives Matter movement and trade unions have also upped their struggle against the Government.\nA recent day of national mourning was called by unions including those representing mining, oil and health workers, with protests drawing attention to the regime’s disastrous handling of the pandemic. Health workers unions have been particularly vocal in light of at least 195,516 health workers being infected.\nThe health-sector UniSaude union has filed a complaint in the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Bolsonaro for crimes against humanity, saying that “Bolsonaro’s management of the pandemic has been criminal and negligent. He has risked the lives of health professionals and the people.”\nSupporting the move, nurse Jhuliana Rodrigues explained that “our accusation shows the people’s pain and concern about the health crisis.”\nTrade unions have been targeted by Bolsonaro, who claimed “there is an excess of rights” for workers in the country and has since abolished the Ministry of Labour.\nThis is only likely to get worse with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimating the pandemic has already led to 7.8 million job losses, and the far-right likely to scapegoat black people, trade unions and anyone else they can to blame for the country’s difficulties, rather than take responsibility for the deadly consequences of their deadly failure to put people and health before private profit.\nThe people of Brazil must know they do not stand alone – and we must build a massive international solidarity movement in support of them.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_bolsonaros-coronavirus-calamity/content_745.html": "Bolsonaro’s Coronavirus Calamity\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nBrazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has launched a ‘Brazil Can’t Stop’ campaign to encourage people to work despite coronavirus. His disastrous response typifies a right-wing that values profits ahead of people’s lives.\nFar-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is under growing pressure as opposition mounts to his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has been widely condemned as putting the interests of big business ahead of those of public health.\nRecently, leaders of opposition parties have come together to demand his resignation, describing him as “a public health problem” and “the biggest obstacle to making urgent decisions to reduce the spread of contagion, save lives and guarantee the income of families, jobs and companies.”\nThe fourteen signatories to the statement, including Fernando Haddad, the former presidential candidate for the Workers’ Party, Ciro Gomes, a lawyer and politician affiliated with the Democratic Labour Party, and Guilherme Boulos, a member of the Socialism and Freedom Party, are calling for a wide-ranging National Emergency Plan around which popular and democratic political forces can unite.\nThe initiative came a few days after Northeastern Brazil’s predominantly progressive governors had expressed their “deep indignation” at Bolsonaro’s views about the coronavirus pandemic, in particular his disdain for the WHO’s advice on social isolation to contain the virus.\nFollowing in the footsteps of US President Trump’s widely reported early stance downplaying the risks, Bolsonaro has dismissed coronavirus as “just a little flu.” Since the outbreak he has minimised the dangers involved and mocked health experts, including his own Health Minister.\nHe has also suggested, without any evidence, that Brazilians may have a natural immunity to the disease. This supposed immunity didn’t stop a score of government ministers and other officials who recently travelled with Bolsonaro to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort becoming infected. According to his son, Eduardo, Bolsonaro himself tested positive – a fact at first confirmed, but later denied by him.\nUnsurprisingly, Bolsonaro then ignored medical advice to self-isolate and personally greeted a large number of his supporters at a demonstration organised to put pressure on the National Congress and the Supreme Court, which have restrained some of his initiatives.\nIn the following days Bolsonaro launched ‘Brazil Can’t Stop,’ a campaign to promote the return to work, saying: “the best remedy for the disease is work. If someone can work, they have to go back to work… You can’t hide. It’s not okay to be quarantined at home, who knows for how many days.”\nThis prompted an intervention by the Prosecutor General’s Office against the messages urging Brazilians to return to “normal life.” In the end Federal Judge Laura Bastos was forced to order the Bolsonaro administration not to put out any adverts encouraging people to behave contrary to the guidelines issued by the Health Ministry.\nAs Covid-19 cases have risen, from a few hundred in early March to nearly 6,000 by April 1st, Bolsonaro’s reckless attitude and behaviour have been met with widespread protest.\nThese began with residents shouting and banging pots from windows and balconies in communities in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, where the governors broke with Bolsonaro to institute quarantine and large-scale closure measures. Social media calls led to these protests quickly spreading to all major Brazilian cities.\nThe opposition parties’ criticism of Bolsonaro’s conduct has been joined by some of his right-wing allies and supporters. It is reported that Ronaldo Caiado, the rightwing governor of Goiás state, cut ties with the president last week. He is on record as saying “it’s appalling. You cannot govern a country like this.”\nOther state governors distancing themselves from Bolsonaro include Carlos Moisés da Silva, governor of strongly pro-Bolsonaro state of Santa Catarina, and Paulo Câmara, governor of the north-eastern state of Pernambuco.\nThese rumblings of discontent are echoed in sections of the right-wing press, with conservative newspaper Estado de São Paulo lamenting that “scientists around the world are struggling to find a treatment for Covid-19. Meanwhile, in Brazil, the incompetence of the current government is incurable.”\nThe paper has registered the extent and seriousness of the outbreak by noting that half the population of Brazil lives in cities that have already registered coronavirus, and the total number of Brazilian municipalities with reported infections has grown tenfold in the last 15 days to 362.\nThere is also a grave risk to Brazil’s indigenous peoples, for whom highly infectious diseases pose a devastating threat, particularly under a president whose actions since assuming office have been so hostile.\nWhile standing in solidarity with progressive movements in Brazil, it’s always important to remember that Bolsonaro only won the Presidential election after left wing front-runner in the polls at the time, former president Lula da Silva, was barred from standing after being jailed on what were widely condemned as trumped-up political charges.\nIt is clear that Lula would be providing a totally different and more people-centred response to the crisis if he was president. He recently summed up his approach to the issue by saying “after we save the people, we can discuss how to save the economy.”\nThis is an international crisis and we must stand with all those fighting for a response to it everywhere that save lives and put public health first – as clearly outlined by the World Health Organisation – including those demanding this in Brazil.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_proper-funding-must-be-restored-for-special-educational-needs/content_296.html": "Proper funding must be restored for special educational needs\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nLabour’s refusal to restore council funding is a betrayal of the vulnerable, and particularly of Send children and young people, says independent candidate CLAUDIA WEBBE\nLABOUR’S refusal to promise to restore council funding to the levels in place before the 2010 Conservative government is a betrayal that means many of our most vulnerable people will continue to live in poverty and hardship and our communities will remain in economic decline.\nCouncils across England have cut services to the bone because of the Tories’ ideologically driven cuts — and the Labour Party will not reverse these cuts if it gets into government this week.\nTo take a very concrete example, Leicester City Council, like many local authorities, is treating young people with special education needs and/or disabilities (Send) as scapegoats for the budget-cutting measures forced on the council by central government funding cuts.\nThe council plans to end the provision of free transport for Send students after they reach the age of 16. This transport typically involves taxis or minibuses for learners who cannot travel by public transport on their own or with a guardian. Paying for such transport will be unaffordable for most people in my constituency, hitting hundreds of young people and their families.\nLocal authorities are supposed to prioritise young people with Send up to the age of 25, but there is no statutory obligation to provide free or subsidised travel to students over 16.\nConsequently, this becomes an easy target for local authority cuts, leaving young people with special needs with no protection or support to get to and from further education, with obvious consequences for their education and life chances.\nAgainst a backdrop of local authorities not able to balance their budgets, young people with special educational needs have now for years been targeted for unfair treatment and potentially denied access to education.\nThis is inherently discriminatory — when Birmingham City Council ended Send transport earlier this year, it admitted that the cut “may particularly affect disadvantaged youth who already face challenges in accessing quality education.”\nIt also flies in the face of equality law. Eleanor Wright, CEO of Send legal charity SOS!SEN, wrote that changing transport provision “wholly ignores the [local authority]’s equality duties: they should take into account that it is inevitable that families of children with disabilities will be adversely affected by this whereas the families of non-disabled parents are not.”\nPaying for dedicated transport will be unaffordable for most people in my constituency, hitting hundreds of young people and their families.\nThe families of these students are effectively held hostage — young people have to stay in education or training until they are 18, meaning families are being hit with an additional burden they cannot avoid and can’t afford or mitigate, when many will already be struggling to cope.\nCouncils should be providing a means for them to get to suitable education, rather than expecting families to pay or provide transport or pull students closer to home into less suitable placements. Whichever party ends up in Downing Street, central government must recognise this and change its policy and funding.\nThis cut, which many councils already impose or are currently considering, is one of many measures that have hit vulnerable young people since 2010. Some 37 per cent of Send young people struggle to attend school even with provided transport, leading to higher absences that are already double the rate for other young people.\nThe right schools for Send young people are often far from where they live, even more so now after 14 years of education spending cuts that have seen each pupil lose around £5,000 over the span of their schooling and have slashed schools’ real-terms capital budgets by half, as Unison notes.\nIf councils cut transport provision, parents who have been able to work because they know getting their children to school is covered will have to quit work to do it themselves, or pay for expensive alternatives, deepening poverty and hardship as well as affecting local economies.\nWhen more than 14 million people in the UK are in poverty and their communities are falling apart, this is just one of a number of unconscionable decisions councils are taking to save money.\nLocal government cuts have disproportionately hit the vulnerable, minoritised communities, those struggling with mental health — and have damaged the local and national economy while also degrading the fabric of our cities and communities and affecting everyone who lives in them.\nBut instead of promising to restore government funding to at least what it was in real terms before 2010 and providing special funds to restore lost services and fix crumbling infrastructures, Labour’s manifesto offers only “multi-year funding settlements.”\nThese would not give councils more money, let alone make good the 23.5 per cent real-terms cut the Local Government Association notes has been inflicted on local government finance since 2010.\nThis is a deep betrayal by Labour of ordinary people, but especially some of our nation’s most vulnerable people, including the children and young people of Leicester East, where I am standing for re-election as an independent candidate.\nWe need to be absolutely clear that absolutely none of the cuts of the last 14 years have been financially necessary or beneficial — none were unavoidable and they actually impeded our economic recovery. They were entirely a political choice — and one that both the Tories and Labour now say they are committed to.\nThese decisions tip costs downhill onto those least able to afford them, hurting children and making the lives of millions debt-ridden and miserable and harming our local and national economies.\nNo-one should underestimate the scale of the problem after years of needless cuts, but we are near the close of a general election in which both of the major parties are not just saying they won’t improve funding to local governments but also say they’re going to follow spending plans that will lead to even deeper cuts.\nFaced with a false choice between two parties committed to needless austerity — and almost indistinguishable on many other fronts as well — voters need to use the ballot box to send a message that whoever wins the election overall will not be permitted to simply sail into “more of the same but worse.”\nThe next government, especially if it is a Labour one, needs to restore local authority funding to what it would have been without these cuts — and at the very least, it needs to immediately put in billions in funding that is ringfenced for vulnerable children and families, for Send pupils and others who have been discriminated against by spending decisions.\nThere’s no excuse for saying this is unaffordable — central government can always find money for a pet project or to fund a war. A newly elected government could also give councils powers to raise additional funds where needed, though really this should come from central government to avoid hitting poorer areas like Leicester East.\nAnd it should enable councils to take transport and other key services back fully in-house, with no more money wasted on tenders that only end up with worse services to make room for profits, so that we are not paying to fatten private profits and so services can be provided at best cost and efficiency.\nIt’s very clear Labour does not intend to reverse austerity if it can get away with “business as usual.” For real change to take place, the House of Commons must have a substantial cohort of socialist independent MPs after Thursday who will not toe a party line and cannot be silenced with threats or the promise of promotion.\nI intend to be one of them, providing that independent voice and standing up for the people of Leicester East.\nClaudia Webbe is the independent parliamentary candidate for Leicester East.\nYou can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_sexism-and-misogyny-pervade-parliament-according-to-leicestershire-mp/content_414.html": "‘Misogynsts are empowered if female MPs say nothing’\nA Leicestershire MP has highlighted examples of sexism and misogyny that she has faced in public life following the furore caused by an article about Labour’s Deputy Leader, Angela Rayner. An anonymous MP has claimed in an article on the Mail on Sunday that Ms Rayner crossed and uncrossed her legs in the Commons to distract Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.\nThe article has been met with a wide backlash from MPs across the political spectrum including Alicia Kearns, Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton. Ms Kearns added that sexism and misogyny pervades Westminster and she and most other female MPs have faced similar treatment to Ms Rayner during their careers.\nShe has posted a number of extracts from various articles on twitter which commented on her appearance and weight. In one, she was described as having “truncheon-like forearms”.\nAnother read: “She spoke at such window-shattering volume, she didn’t sound rattled in the slightest. A charming rhinoceros, catching sight of the ambitious Sister Kearns, might have second thoughts and go tiptoeing off into the kinkeliba bushes.”\nMs Kearns added that if that behaviour is not challenged, it contributes “to the permissive environment of sexism that surrounds Parliament”. She also wrote: “When women in politics are consistently demeaned and denigrated for their sex and appearance, misogynists across our country are empowered.”\nShe added that her male counterparts are not subjected to the same treatment, saying “some journalists are incapable of writing about female MPs without denigrating their appearances rather than their policies”.\nIndependent MP for Leicester East, Claudia Webbe also told LeicestershireLive that ‘horrific abuse’ towards her had “intensified since becoming an MP” and that she stood in solidarity with Rayner.\nShe said: “Women face unique, unacceptable challenges in public life. I, like many others, have faced horrific, violent, misogynistic and racist online abuse throughout my political career, which has intensified since becoming an MP. Polling shows that women are being deterred from running for office because of abuse and harassment.\n“We cannot accept this. The time has come for the government and the media to bring this epidemic of misogynist abuse to an end.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_gaza-ceasefire-deal-isnt-a-ceasefire-or-a-deal/content_55.html": "Gaza ‘ceasefire deal’ isn’t a ceasefire or a deal\nBy Claudia Webbe\nThe so-called peace deal trumpeted by Blinken is so weighted towards Israel’s political goals as to be a total non-starter, while at the same time the US continues to reject any meaningful arms embargo, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described his government’s proposed new “ceasefire deal” for Gaza as being agreed upon by Israel. Blinken, who has visited Israel for talks at least nine times since October 7, has stated that Hamas’s refusal to sign the deal is all that is preventing a ceasefire from being put in place rapidly.\nBut arguably this can be seen as deeply misleading. In reality, the so-called deal appears to be neither a ceasefire nor a deal. Instead, it is so heavily weighted in favour of Israel’s political goals and military objectives that it would amount to a capitulation by the Palestinians of Gaza to a new reality that would leave them under even greater control and occupation than what has been imposed on them for the best part of two decades.\nYet despite this, according to Israeli media reporting of comments by Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Israel is still refusing to agree the deal — reporting completely at odds with the claims of the US government spokespeople and the Democrats, the US party of government.\nAs it stands, according to details leaked to US “papers of record” and international media, the “deal” involves only a temporary truce to allow the release of Israeli captives. Netanyahu said at the time of Blinken’s announcement that he will not accept any deal that means Israel ending its war on Gaza before “Hamas is destroyed.”\nBut despite the killing of what the Lancet’s medical experts calculate to be almost 200,000 people so far, Israeli military leaders have quietly admitted that they are nowhere near achieving the destruction of Hamas and are likely further from it than ever, due to the impact on Hamas recruitment of so many young people who have seen loved ones and even entire families destroyed.\nIt is debatable whether the Israeli government is seriously concerned about the release of its citizens from Gaza. The families of captives certainly do not believe it is and continue to protest against the perceived lack of seriousness in this regard of Netanyahu and his cabinet.\nLast Tuesday, Israel’s media reported that the military had admitted that its bombs killed another six Israeli hostages in a single attack. On the same day, former hostage Noa Argamani told a gathering of G7 leaders that the injuries she had suffered in captivity were caused by Israeli bombs and missiles. She was subsequently forced to correct media claims that she had been “beaten” by her captors.\nAny close analysis of the deal, would highlight that the US proposal lacks any commitment by Israel to release Palestinian hostages arbitrarily arrested, held without charge or trial and reportedly tortured by Israel.\nThe deal would also leave Israel’s years-long blockade in place, which has been intensified to the point of siege since the genocide began, and would set in stone the structural fragmentation that Israel has imposed since October 7. Israel would retain control of the Rafah border and the international aid that needs to pass through it to reach the two million Palestinians who need it. The danger of that can be clearly seen both in the actions of settlers who have blocked and destroyed most of the aid for months, and in the comments of Israeli politicians.\nIn early August, government minister Bezalel Smotrich said it might be “justified and moral” to starve the entire population of Gaza. Even more explicitly, former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman called last week for the complete blockade of all essentials for life, even water: “No electricity, no crossings, no water, no fuel and no goods, complete disconnection.”\nIsrael would also keep control of the “Philadelphi corridor” that runs along the border with Egypt — an outcome that Palthink for Strategic Studies founder Omar Shaban says that Egypt would reject as well as the Palestinians — and of the so-called “Netzarim corridor” that splits Gaza into northern and southern parts and is used by Israel as a conduit and launching point for murderous raids north and south. The deal would allow Israel to search every person trying to cross and to refuse transit, leaving many residents of northern Gaza, who moved south to “safe zones” that were still heavily bombed, permanently unable to return to what remains of their homes and communities.\nIsrael has been accused of regularly sabotaging ceasefire deals since the first discussions began. Even the generally pro-Israel New York Times reported earlier this month that documents from the negotiations that it had seen showed that Israel had added new demands to the current proposal at least five times, including the retention of control of the Egyptian border, “moving the goalposts” to effectively put agreement out of reach.\nThis is not new behaviour. It is argued that in addition to changing terms when agreement might be in sight, Israel routinely steps up its violence in Gaza during negotiations. Al-Shabaka and Middle East Institute policy fellow Tariq Kenney-Shawa put it succinctly: “Israel has always ratcheted up the intensity of attacks on their opponents in the lead-up to ceasefires … Netanyahu has repeatedly made it clear that he does not want the war to end, both because Israel has not achieved its stated objectives, apart from the complete destruction of Gaza, and because of his political fears.”\nThe “political fears” include the likelihood that Netanyahu will face prosecution on corruption charges soon after he leaves office, an outcome that would result from the break-up of his coalition with far-right parties that will not accept any end to the hostilities.\nHamas has reportedly said it will accept any deal that involves a permanent end to the killing of Palestinian civilians, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, the return of people to their home areas and the reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure Israel has destroyed — provisions that were included in the original ceasefire deal it agreed at the turn of the year but that were then rejected by the Israeli government.\nMany have questioned Blinken’s role as an honest broker for peace and have argued that the Gaza “ceasefire deal” isn’t a ceasefire or a deal. As The Intercept put it “…[f]or anyone paying attention, it is now abundantly clear that the US-led Gaza ceasefire talks have become a tool for the perpetuation of Israel’s genocidal war … The so-called ceasefire negotiations are a form of camouflage that is being deployed by Biden and Harris to distract from the reality of their support for Israel’s mass atrocities in Gaza…”\nAs the US continues to reject any meaningful arms embargo that might force Israel into genuine negotiations, the recent Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, would likely be seen as presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s first major test in relation to the situation in Gaza and pathway to a meaningful ceasefire.\nThroughout, the Democrats continued to talk of the US’s commitment to protecting Israel against the consequences of its actions and even refused to allow a Palestinian-American speaker, at the convention. This sent shockwaves for those who had clung to the notion of hope.\nThe commitment of Republicans to support Israel’s actions was never in doubt, but the Democrats’ continued refusal to stand up against genocide or even to listen to the demands of the Uncommitted movement, which protested outside the event, has so infuriated supporters of Palestinian rights that even the “Muslim Women for Harris” group has disbanded and withdrawn its support for the Democratic nominee.\nIn her keynote address to the convention, Harris asserted: “…I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself. Because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that the terrorist organisation Hamas caused on October 7… At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realise their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination…”\nThere was no mention of the US supplied weapons that made possible the devastation in Gaza!\nThe British government, for its part, could play a significant role in bring a meaningful ceasefire closer by announcing the arms embargo that international law requires and that would increase political pressure on other arms-supplying nations to stop arming the genocide.\nHowever, Keir Starmer made his position amply clear when he sabotaged the SNP’s ceasefire motion in February. In power, he has kept hidden the advice of government lawyers on the legality of continuing to supply weapons that he and then-shadow foreign secretary David Lammy insisted in opposition that the government should release. In reality, his government will follow US policy, whoever is president.\nMeanwhile, Israel has continued to kill hundreds of refugees, bombing schools and markets, with yet another school bombed at the weekend as talks in Cairo were breaking up — and assassinated Hamas’s chief negotiator Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\nThe real prospects for peace, in the absence of political will among Western leaders to take the steps necessary to create a real willingness for peace on the part of Israel’s government, seem remote. This means that the mass popular movement against the genocide must continue and even intensify protest and dissent to ensure that the news agenda is not allowed to move on and make the issue of Gaza mere background noise.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the former member of Parliament for Leicester East (2019-24).

The fact that hard work no longer guarantees a secure life is an unforgivable breakdown of our basic social contract.\nBoohoo must urgently release a full, transparent list of its supplying factories in Leicester. It is appalling that the exploited labour of our residents is helping to finance extravagant corporate salaries. We can no longer tolerate billionaire company owners making vast profits on the back of the working class.\nSectoral collective bargaining is long overdue to raise wages, reduce inequality, prevent the undercutting of terms and conditions, enable effective enforcement of rights and more importantly enable the voices of workers to be heard.\nThe scandal of workplace exploitation must no longer be ignored. Nobody in Leicester or across the UK deserves the indignity of being paid under the minimum wage.\nI recognise that this is an incredibly difficult time for Leicester residents who continue to face restrictions that other parts of the country do not.\nYour sacrifices are paying off, as our number of weekly cases have dropped by over 30%. Yet sadly, the most recent figures show we recorded the sixth highest number of cases for a local authority. Our city had more Covid-19 deaths than any other part of England and Wales in July. According to figures from the ONS, 24 people in Leicester tragically died – as opposed to 92% of local authorities which registered less than 10 deaths.\nThis is a tragic reminder of the government’s failure to keep our city safe. Yet we cannot let the progress we have made go to waste. By remaining vigilant, the bustling Leicester that we know and love will be back as quickly as possible.\nThe latest government announcement for Leicester here.\nAs I say in this story, this is the latest example of the inhumanity which the Home Office has hardwired into our immigration system.\nAfter effectively being found institutionally racist by the Windrush lessons learnt review, the Home Office must halt it’s fanatical scapegoating of migrants.\nAnd the government must stop trying to distract from its awful coronavirus record with this divisive, damaging rhetoric.\nBrilliant to catch up with @faresharemidlands at the Northfields Adventure Playground off Gypsy Lane. The work being done by the Adventure Playgrounds in Leicester is vital and their partnership with FareShare is brilliant. We must all play our part in food reuse and the redistribution of food and tackle food insecurity.\nI stand in full solidarity with all those who are exercising their legal right to claim asylum. Britain First and other hate groups represent the very worst of our country. They must not be given any platform to legitimise their vile anti-migrant discourse.\nIt is ludicrous to suggest that a small number of vulnerable migrants pose a threat to our security, economy or social life. Asylum seekers do not arrive in the UK to leech off the state – Asylum Support Allowance is a mere £37.75 per week. It is also far from the case that the UK is overwhelmed with asylum seekers, with Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and France registering far more asylum applicants.\nThe right for different communities and cultures to live side by side has been fought for by generations of struggle. It is up to all of us today who oppose racism to continue this fight against all forms of hatred and bigotry.”\nCheck out my comments in this The Morning Star article here.\nIt is crucial that we focus on the reason why we are seeing the dehumanising discourse surrounding migrants and asylum-seekers raise its ugly head once again.\nWe have a government that has overseen the worst coronavirus death rate of any European country as well as the worst recession since records began.\nSadly, the Tories know that, to distract from their litany of failures, they simply have to ratchet up their “tough on immigration” rhetoric, such as by talking about militarising the channel crossing, and the right-wing sections our media landscape will lap it up.\nWe cannot let this government off the hook. We must stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the victims of this brutal discourse, and we must ensure that this floundering government is held responsible for its appalling record.\nRead the full article here.\nI have been contacted by many of my constituents regarding the attempts of British Gas and Centrica to use the covid-19 crisis as a smokescreen to downgrade their working conditions. As we face the worst recession on record, it has never been more important for us to stand up for workers’ rights.

Stay safe and have a great day. I hope it brings new beginnings and renewed strength, truth and goodness.\nThe economic impact of the Coronavirus on the country has been devastating and we have felt it even more so in Leicester East and across Leicester, due to the continued extended lockdown. I know that the impact has been uneven and particularly harsh for some more than others.\nI really want to hear your story and views on how this has impacted you.\nI would appreciate if you could take a moment to fill in my survey using the link here so that I can better assist you and everyone across the constituency so that no one is left behind.\nCongratulations to all receiving their GCSE results today. It’s been a tough year. You can be proud of your achievements.\nYou have the opportunity to change this world; to end the climate injustice, race & class inequalities and transform society so that it works in the interest of the majority not the wealthy 1%.\nSo I am quoted as saying in this article, I am pleased that, thanks to the hard work of Leicester’s health workers, council and residents, incident rates have been declining article across our city. Yet they remain considerably higher than the national average.\nWhile I know how difficult this extended lockdown has been, I urge Leicester residents to keep up the hard work by following the continuing safety measures. We cannot risk undoing the progress we have made.\nThe Government were initially supposed to make this announcement on Friday – then it was Monday, then Tuesday. The people of Leicester have made tremendous sacrifices. We deserved clarity and transparency – not dithering and confusion.\nThe Government has been forced to U-turn on their rigged algorithm for A-Level Results. This is a victory for the young people who fought for their futures. I am proud of all students across Leicester who campaigned today (in the rain!) and all weekend. You have powerfully made your voices heard.\nThe Tory govt thought they could get away with downgrading working class students. It was your resistance and challenge that forced the change.\nSolidarity.\nI thoroughly enjoyed volunteering with Islah Trust at Northfield Neighbourhood Centre and Human Appeal where we were packing and delivering emergency food parcels to those in need. I cannot praise these organisations enough for their hard work and commitment over this time.\nDuring the Black Lives Matter movement, we’ve rightly seen renewed calls for our schools to teach the true brutal history of the British empire and the legacy of imperialism, colonialism and racism which continue today to have generational impact.\nThe Sotik Massacre of 1905 is one of the most appalling massacres in the sordid history of the British Empire. If we are to end the scourge of institutional racism and the destructive legacy of colonialism, it is vital that young people are taught the true history of race relations. I have written to the Education Secretary urging him to ensure that this atrocity is included in the national curriculum.\nYou can see my letter to Gavin Williamson here.\nHappy Indian Independence day to everyone celebrating in Leicester East!\nFor months, our government has claimed that the UK will have a “world-beating” Test and Trace system to combat the virus.Yet instead, they have presided over a failed and possibly corrupt programme which prioritises the enrichment of private corporations over the protection of our communities. Leicester is a prime example of the success of local public health led systems. The government must introduce a fully nationalised system which empowers local authorities to protect our communities.\nYou can read my latest article for The Independent here.\nThousands of UK residents with No Recourse to Public Funds have already been driven into destitution during the Coronavirus crisis. The government claims to be ‘protecting public funds’ by preventing vulnerable migrants from accessing basic benefits. Yet they do not exhibit this same frugality when handing out wasteful, multi-million contracts to private companies, or enabling multi-billionaires and corporations to evade tax.\nAs we embark on the deepest recession since records began it is crucial that all residents, regardless of their immigration status, must be able to afford to stay safe during this pandemic. Otherwise we risk creating a forgotten underclass of vulnerable migrants.\nLeicester is home to many workers with NRPF, for whom it is impossible to survive without attending work – often in unsafe conditions. The government must ensure that all migrants have automatic access to resources without fear of detention or deportation by abolishing the NRPF provision.You can read my letter to Priti Patel here.\nWishing everyone in Leicester East who is celebrating over the next two days a happy Janmashtami. Some Temples are now open in Leicester, with social distancing measures in place. Stay safe, and enjoy your celebrations.\nAs I say in this article, the coronavirus crisis has shown that the people who really matter and keep our society ticking are not billionaires and the super-rich, but nurses, carers, cleaners, checkout attendants and many more essential frontline workers.\nWe can no longer live in a society where health workers are underpaid, frontline workers are undervalued or our NHS is starved of funding.\nI stand in full solidarity with all trade unionists and NHS workers who will be out tomorrow to call for the fair and equitable treatment that health professionals deserve. We must oppose the conservatives’ attempts to pit sections of the working class against each other with their divide and rule public sector pay strategy.\nThis crisis has shown that the people who really matter and keep our society ticking are not billionaires and the super-rich, but nurses, carers, cleaners, checkout attendants and many more essential frontline workers.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-problem-is-fascism/content_96.html": "The problem is fascism\nBy Claudia Webbe\nSuccessive governments have nurtured far-right sentiment through policies targeting minorities and protesters, while diverting attention from capitalism’s failures, meeting nine of Umberto Eco’s 14 points of fascism, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE\nTHE horror of riots and naked violence that Britain is facing from so-called far-right activists is not, as is frequently presented by some politicians and sections of the media, an expression of legitimate concerns and grievances of ordinary people at “excessive” or “uncontrolled” immigration or the supposed misdeeds of immigrant communities.\nAnd it is certainly not the fault of the peaceful protesters demanding an end to genocide or the destruction of our environment, even though the former have routinely been categorised as “hate marchers” and the latter have been treated far more harshly in the courts than violent and destructive racist right-wingers who took to the streets, chanting slogans “no surrender” and “England till I die” and even more harshly than those far-right activists who took to social media spreading Islamophobic lies in an attempt to whip up a racist mob.\nBritain is facing the growth of fascism, often funded by right-wing groups and individuals abroad, and the lifting of social taboos against the expression of racism. This is not accidental or simply a natural cyclical phenomenon, as unavoidable as the weather.\nInstead, it grows out of the overt and structural fascism of the British state as manifested in successive governments over decades. This both creates the economic and social conditions in which far-right bigotry can thrive and drives that development through the deliberate use of scapegoating to divert attention from the realities of government failures and agendas creating systemic inequity and inequality.\nAnd as always, this is underpinned by a capitalist system that seeks to protect its interests and, currently, to divert attention from capitalism’s global crisis and to demonise those who demand change.\nFascism, inherently an assault on the working class and its rights, it can be argued, is not far removed from the mindset of the far right of the Conservative Party that held such influence for years — and still now influences the Labour Party under Keir Starmer, which arguably has taken a reactionary stance on immigration, disabilities and benefits and panders to the wishes of capitalism even in these early days of the Starmer government.\nA look at the fundamental characteristics of fascism shows how far it has already advanced in Britain at the hands of successive governments.\nItalian philosopher and academic Umberto Eco noted, in his 1995 essay Ur-Fascism, there are 14 characteristics of fascism. It can be argued at least nine of them are easily recognisable in Britain and driven by government propaganda and language, including under the current government.\nThe Cult of Tradition — the constant appeal to imagined “British traditions” and “British patriotism” as an excuse for repression of difference and dissent.\nDisagreement Is Treason — this kind of rhetoric was common and barely disguised, again in recent Tory governments. But it has also been a defining feature of Keir Starmer’s regime within the Labour Party and is already threatening to replicate itself in government.\nMPs who dared to vote with their conscience on issues from war to child poverty have not only faced the withdrawal of the Labour whip and co-ordinated deselection campaigns but have been maligned and attacked. Members of the party who disagreed with the leadership on its hierarchy of racism and its embrace of Conservative policies have been described as “fleas” to be “shaken off.”\nFear of Difference — the demonisation of refugees and minorities was a defining feature of Conservative governments, but Starmer’s Labour Party has used the same tactics, singling out Bangladeshis during the general election campaign and claiming that Muslim voters in the 2021 Batley and Spen by-election were voting against Labour because Starmer was “being too tough on anti-semitism.” In June, Pink News analysed Labour and Tory policy plans on trans people and found little functional difference.\nAppeal to a Frustrated Middle Class — both Labour and the Tories have demonised the poor, treating benefit claimants as a social problem and wrongly discussing national economic policy as if it is a household budget. The “tough decisions” both parties claim they have to take are heavily weighted against the poor and vulnerable.\nObsession With a Plot — the hyping-up of an enemy threat, with references to the “great replacement,” a well-known far-right theory, this is often directed against Muslim migrants, who are accused of falsifying, faking, or co-ordinating votes or of acting on behalf of foreign powers when they protest against genocide. But it is not limited to them, with Russia cited as behind the recent far-right protests to deflect from the British state’s role in promoting hate.\nPacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy because Life is Permanent Warfare — there must always be an enemy to fight. This can be seen in the determination of the British state to keep funding war — including Starmer’s commitment to increase military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP, a 25 per cent increase — while launching attacks on Yemen and allowing senior military officials to talk up the likelihood of Britain going to war.\nContempt for the Weak — this has been clear in the Conservative policies on the poor and disabled since 2010 and is just as clear in the Labour right’s notorious claim that Labour is not the party of the unemployed, which is now seen in the new Labour government’s refusal to lift the benefit cap that puts hundreds of thousands of children needlessly into poverty and Rachel Reeves’s demand for further cuts that will disproportionately hit the vulnerable.\nSelective Populism — we have seen the rise of populism, in parties like Reform UK who now have four million votes and MPs in Parliament willing to amplify and legitimise their false appeal of being on the side of ordinary people. We also have the claim of governments to represent some monolithic “will of the people,” despite being voted in by a minority of the electorate, especially in the case of the current government which achieved 9.7 million absolute voters or 33.7 per cent. This “will” is the supposed mandate to take actions that harm and “other” many.\nNewspeak — from successive governments we’ve seen the creation of the “hostile environment” and constant use of slogans like “stop the boats” designed to limit critical reasoning or disguise the realities of government policy and action.\nState fascism is also seen in the use of police violence against peaceful protesters, the creeping legislative and procedural assaults on our freedoms to protest and the use of civil disobedience to resist warmongering or the destruction of our environment. It is visible in the brutality of the sentencing imposed on left-wing demonstrators simply for causing inconvenience and in the exploitation of unrest to attack our freedoms to organise and communicate.\nThese state actions against left and humanitarian organising and resistance also fuel the right-wing mindset that those who stand up for the weak and for minorities “promote hate” and deserve to be abused and attacked, while normalising racism and bigotry.\nBritain’s political and media classes have used these tactics to divert from the crisis of neoliberal capitalism that threatens their position and privilege and from their corruption and political failures. Identifying the left and its potential to galvanise the masses as the main threat to their interests — and they are correct — they have emboldened the far right in Britain as a means of dividing and undermining our class.\nAs usual and as the lessons of Britain’s past clearly demonstrate, the burden of the fight against fascism rests on the shoulders of ordinary people. If fascism is to be defeated in this country, it requires the building of a mass popular movement.\nThe Palestinian solidarity and anti-genocide movement can potentially form the foundation of such a movement, but what grows out of it must be even more intentional and cohesive and it must get across the message that what matters is our class solidarity and that this, regardless of skin colour or faith, is what can affect the change that millions need to see in our country.\nWe will not just be struggling against the extra-parliamentary brutality of racist thugs and rioters, but against a political establishment that has amply shown its readiness to incite and exploit them as an excuse for an assault on our rights to resist and to highlight its evils and its collusion in war crimes and imperialism.\nIf we unite around this message and refuse to be diverted from it, we can win the arguments on race, on the structure of our society, on austerity, on justice — and against fascism. More people than ever are waking up to them. Fascism is an existential threat to decency and justice — but a united left movement of “the many” can and will defeat it.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the former member of Parliament for Leicester East (2019-24).

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_its-time-to-make-amends-for-the-crimes-of-the-empire/content_950.html": "It is time to make amends for the crimes of empire\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nBritain’s public apology and reparations to Kenya’s Kipsigis and Talai victims is long overdue. It is vital that we keep fighting for justice for the victims of racism past and present, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nONE of the many benefits of the Black Lives Matter movement is that it has forced an increased reckoning with the corrosive legacy of colonialism. This is especially important in Britain, as the brutal history of the British empire casts a long and enduring shadow on present-day global dynamics.\nWe cannot talk about the present without former empires engaging in a process of recognition, apologies, returning what was stolen and reparations for past atrocities.\nBy 1921, the British empire ruled a population of between 470 and 570 million people, approximately one-quarter of the world’s people. It covered about 14.3 million square miles, about a quarter of Earth’s total land area.\nThis means that a large percentage of the world was subject to the extractive violence of British colonialism. The time has come for former empires to apologise for and take seriously the historical debt that they owe to the countries, communities and individuals who endured their cruelty.\nLast week, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) called on the United Kingdom to make a public apology and adequately compensate the Kipsigis and Talai victims who suffered horrendous violations and land expropriation under the British empire in Kenya.\nIn a recent letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the UNHRC expressed serious concern at the lack of accountability and remedy for the inhumane acts perpetrated against the Kipsigis and Talai people, the failure of Britain’s government to establish facts on the victims and the nature of harm as well as the lack of reparations in accordance with international laws.\nThe letter states that “we would like to remind your excellency’s government of the obligation of states to adopt measures to ensure justice, truth, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence of past human rights violations, as guaranteed by various international human rights instruments.” The government were given 60 days to respond and so far, they have not done so.\nThe letter follows a petition filed before the UN in Geneva, Switzerland by Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony. In November 2018, a request was sent to the British government to consent to arbitrate the dispute with the Kipsigis and Talai people and meet with their representative.\nHowever, in February 2019, the British government replied that it had “no intention to enter any process” to resolve the claims. This is a shameful dereliction of responsibility.\nSocialists have historically been amongst the most vocal and vociferous critics of empire, as we understand that racialised and economic exploitation are implacably interconnected. We must fully support the Kenyan people in their efforts to rectify historical injustices.\nThe British government and British-registered companies must fully comply with the UNHRC’s demands, implement fully the 2019 ruling of the Kenya National Land Commission and address the historical and current day oppression and exploitation of Kenyan people.\nThe extractive, violent interference of the British empire in Kenya began in 1895 and lasted until Kenyan independence in 1964. Kipsigis, Talai and other indigenous people were subjected to gross violations of human rights such as unlawful killing, sexual violence, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary detention, arbitrary displacement and violations of rights to privacy, family life and property.\nAcross Kenya, Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and other regions many were forced to endure the injustice of colonialism — indigenous communities were systematically alienated from their rightful lands.\nOver 500,000 Kipsigis and Talai people were forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in Kericho and Bomet Counties, the best farmland in Kenya and many left to die of starvation in Gwassi, an arid area miles from their home. Around 500,000 acres of land was handed by the British colonial government to white settlers and to British registered companies. Let us call this what it is: ethnic cleansing.\nThe findings of the Kenya National Lands Commission in 2018 demonstrated the enduring human rights violations of the Kipsigis and Talai people. The historical injustice of land theft laid the groundwork for decades of uneven development and corporate extraction — as we see in the persistent damage caused by global tea plantations in Kenya’s Bomet and Kericho counties.\nBritish registered companies, Unilever Ltd, James Finlay Tea, George Williamson Tea, Sotik Tea and Sotik Highlands Tea continue to occupy stolen lands, artificially fix the price of tea to deny local farmers a fair price and exploit tea workers with appalling working conditions and substandard housing, with no investment in local schools and communities.\nI have been campaigning for atrocities perpetrated in Kenya by the British empire to be taught as part of our national curriculum and for the British government to issue reparations and formal apologies.\nIn September 2020 I tabled an Early Day Motion in Parliament to express solidarity with the people of Kenya who are seeking redress for the theft of their lands under the British colonial government. Many of the victims of this exploitative land theft are still alive today.\nThe Early Day Motion called upon the British government and British-registered companies to implement fully the 2019 ruling of the Kenya National Land Commission and address the historical and current-day oppression and exploitation of Kenyan people.\nThe mistreatment of the Kipsigis and Talai peoples is far from the only atrocity perpetrated by the British empire in Kenya alone. The repression of the Mau Mau rebellion in the 1950s has rightly been termed “Britain’s gulag,” in which 1.5 million Kenyans, predominantly Kikuyu, were confined to a network of detention camps and heavily patrolled villages in which they were systematically tortured, starved, beaten, mistreated and raped, with many also executed or hanged by the British administration. It is one of the most shameful chapters of British history.\nIn 2013, the British state issued a half-apology for this institutionalised abuse — as then-foreign secretary William Hague said he “deeply regretted” that these unspeakable crimes took place. £2,600 each was issued to just over 5,200 claimants. This is nowhere near enough.\nIn a further affront, the remains of those killed during the British crackdown have not yet been identified, located and reunited with their families and communities, so that the necessary burial ceremonies and memorialisation can take place.\nA full, unequivocal apology is long overdue for all atrocities perpetrated by the British empire — in Kenya and across the world — along with serious reparations proportionate to the scale of the crimes.\nIt is vital that we on the left keep working with movements for justice across the world to dismantle systems of neo-colonialism, global inequality and racism.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_this-amounts-to-social-murder/content_259.html": "This amounts to social murder\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe left has said it for a year and Cummings has confirmed it: the government’s handling of the pandemic has consistently prioritised private profit over public health. Now we must hold them to account, for their crimes against us, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST week’s explosive testimony by Dominic Cummings, former chief adviser to the Prime Minister, revealed, if true, the extent of the government’s deadly handling of the pandemic.\nThe most shocking admission was that, due to government negligence, unpreparedness and sheer arrogance, many thousands of people died unnecessarily because of decisions made in Number 10.\nCummings was frank in his assessment: “Tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die.” If we trust a word of it, there is no need to wait for an independent inquiry, the Prime Minister must urgently apologise for this deadly dereliction of duty to everyone who lost a loved one due to his government’s carelessness. Then he must resign.\nIt was also unearthed that, contrary to government mistruths at the time, there were significant PPE shortages with British stocks continually being sent abroad even as the pandemic accelerated.\nCummings said that Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock “should’ve been fired for at least 15-20 things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions.”\nPerhaps the most severe and deadly of these “lies” was that, despite persistent government promises, there was no protective ring around care homes in the early stages of the pandemic.\nAs Cummings put it, “infected people went back to care homes and then infected people and it spread like wildfire inside the care homes. Also the care homes didn’t have the PPE to deal with it and they didn’t have the testing for the staff, so you had this cascading series of crises — like a domino effect, rippling through the system.”\nIt would be easy to write Cummings off as a self-confessed liar giving evidence to Parliament about a Prime Minister whom he branded a liar and further whom Cummings indicates was surrounded by liars in Parliament. Or perhaps the Conservatives in power have run out of opposition or people to fight with so they are eating themselves.\nHowever, we know the government’s lack of preparedness meant that NHS staff were fatally exposed. Tragically, more than 500 NHS and care workers have died after exposure to Covid-19, amid a shameful failure to provide them with suitable PPE.\nThis underlines the selflessness of those who dedicate their lives and even put themselves at risk to help others.\nAny reasonable government would ensure that those who have contributed most to our national effort receive a fair compensation for their heroic efforts, including a 15 per cent pay rise. Yet sadly, we do not have a reasonable government.\nThe details of Boris Johnson’s negligence and sheer carelessness are sickening.\nCummings confirmed that herd immunity was the initial policy of the government, which they knew would have cost at least 220,000 lives. Yet, the government denied that this was ever the policy, despite being on record saying exactly that, and got away with it due to our compliant media class.\nIndeed, it should not have taken a disgruntled government employee to expose this government’s deadly handling of the coronavirus. This was a damning indictment of our media ecosystem and reveals the cosy relationship between government and client journalists, which Cummings himself exposed.\nJohnson’s personal culpability and ineptitude was laid bare in the testimony. Johnson was said to regard Covid as “the new swine flu” at the start of 2020 and held a complete disregard for widespread loss of life — keen as he was to prioritise the economy over public health.\nIn a clear bid to grab our attention and headlines, Cummings described how officials had talked of getting the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, to inject Johnson live on TV with the coronavirus “so everyone realises it’s nothing to be frightened of.”\nThis graphic description is only a few steps removed from Donald Trump’s encouraging people to inject bleach to combat the virus and reveals how utterly unfit for office our Prime Minister is.\nWhat this tells us is that the government’s mishandling throughout the Covid pandemic amounts to what Friedrich Engels termed “social murder.”\nEngels used this to describe conditions in Manchester in 1845, in which the ruling class places masses of workers “in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and unnatural death.”\nThere is no other way to describe the government’s handling of the pandemic. It follows that everyone at the top of government associated with this utter calamity must resign.\nEvery community has been hit by this crisis, but it has especially impacted the poor, vulnerable and the oppressed including those in lower-paid work and who cannot work from home. African, Asian and minority ethnic communities, the disabled and those in poorer housing are among those hit hardest by this crisis.\nMy own community of Leicester East has been under lockdown or enhanced restrictions longer than virtually any other area. As one of the most diverse areas of Britain, Leicester is more deeply affected by the disproportionate impact of the virus.\nA leaked government report found that “existing socioeconomic inequality” had left African, Asian and minority ethnic communities at greater exposure to Covid-19 as they were more likely to live in cramped and multigenerational housing in deprived areas and hold public-facing jobs.\nWorkers were denied proper sick pay and were forced to work, even whilst ill, in conditions which were not Covid-secure otherwise, they would suffer a loss of pay. Such were the conditions of wage exploitation in Leicester’s garment Industry.\nThe disproportionate suffering of areas like Leicester is a damning indictment of the government’s failure to prioritise public health and implement a Zero-Covid strategy to suppress the virus. Yet the government continues to make the same mistakes over and over again.\nIt should have been made simple: if you get contacted by test and trace, you must be provided with the material means to isolate. It was estimated that, at the peak of the virus, at least 20,000 people a day were not complying fully with isolation orders, allowing the virus to spread.\nThis is not due to moral failures on behalf of the public — but because it is impossible for people living on poverty wages to comply with guidance on self-isolation and social distancing.\nYet the government failed to ensure this for working-class people in Leicester and across Britain. They were happy to squander billions to enrich private companies but flinched at ensuring that people were not faced with a choice between destitution or infection.\nA Zero-Covid approach was necessary, to suppress the virus and prioritise public health over private profit. This would have avoided a cycle of confusing and ineffective local lockdowns. Even today with the concerning rise of the B.1.617 variant, it would protect both lives and livelihoods by driving down the virus so that the economy can properly restart when it is safe to do so.\nThe government’s handling of the pandemic has been defined by a belief that there is a trade-off between health and the economy. It is clear which side they are on, as they have consistently prioritised private profit over public health.\nYet this is a false dichotomy. Partly due to the government’s many attempts to prioritise the economy, from the initial herd immunity strategy, the Eat out to Help Out scheme and the rush to allow people into high-streets to do their Christmas shopping, we have the highest number of excess deaths in Europe, one of the worst death rates in the world and are also facing our worst recession for over 300 years.\nAcross the world, countries that have pursued a zero-Covid strategy are returning to normality, with all the economic benefits that brings. The government must follow the best examples set by countries across the world, especially across East Asia and the Pacific and adopt a zero-Covid strategy. This is the only way to prioritise the protection of everyone in Britain and especially those whom the virus has disproportionately affected.\nThis episode must be a wake-up call. We have a government responsible for “social murder,” yet they are still running high in the polls — it us up to us on the left to tell the truth in our neighbourhoods, communities and workplaces and continue to fight for a society which is built around people’s needs, health and wellbeing.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Claudia Webbe also paid tribute to all the search teams involved in the operation to find little Xielo Maruziva.\nIt has now been more than two weeks since he fell into the River Soar while he and his family were walking along a towpath near Marsden Lane in Aylestone Meadows. The desperate search to find him has been unsuccessful so far.\nMs Webbe, the Independent MP for the area, said: “The anguish that little Xielo’s family must be feeling is unimaginable to anyone who hasn’t gone through it, but it must be made worse by the fact that the search for him has so far been unsuccessful. What can anyone say in such circumstances, but I want them to know that my heart is breaking for them and I only hope that he is soon found so that they can begin to resolve the questions they must be facing and to process their grief.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-story-of-the-ugandan-asians-inspires-us-to-fight-racism/content_887.html": "The Story of the Ugandan Asians inspires us to fight\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\n50 years and on the resilience and resourcefulness of Ugandan Asian refugees who settled in my community should encourage us to redesign the asylum system along the principles of solidarity and decency, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE identity of my home city of Leicester is forged from a proud history of immigration and welcoming those seeking asylum, with Jewish Russian migrants arriving in the mid-1800s followed by European Jews fleeing persecution and Nazi barbarism in the 1930s.\nAfter the second world war, Leicester welcomed migrants from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent. In the late 1960s and 1970s, thousands of Asian refugees arrived from East Africa, notably those fleeing persecution in Uganda, and this century we have hosted refugees and asylum-seekers from all over the world.\nThis is what makes Leicester special. We are the city where the minorities make up the majority. And we are richer for this vibrant exchange of cultures.\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of the arrival in Britain of thousands of Ugandan Asians. It is vital that we commemorate the anniversary of the exodus in 1972 of those fleeing the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin and also celebrate the contribution the East African Asian community has made to Leicester’s culture and community over the last half a century.\nIn early August, 1972, Amin ordered the expulsion of his country’s Asian minority, giving them just 90 days to leave the country. At the time of the expulsion, there were about 80,000 individuals of Indian descent in Uganda.\nThe expulsion took place against the backdrop of longstanding anti-Indian racism in Uganda, which Amin whipped up with racist tropes of disloyalty, non-integration and commercial malpractice.\nMore than half of those set for expulsion had British passports and eventually settled in Britain and several thousand of those started new lives in Leicester. According to the Uganda Resettlement Board over 28,000 Ugandan Asians came to Britain after being expelled by Idi Amin.\nOf the other refugees who were accounted for, 6,000 went to Canada, 4,500 refugees ended up in India and 2,500 went to nearby Kenya or Pakistan. Twenty-three thousand Ugandan Asians who had been granted Ugandan citizenship were, after some dispute, permitted to stay — yet many chose to leave rather than endure further intimidation, with only 4,000 known to have stayed.\nIt is vital that we celebrate the resilience and resourcefulness of those who were displaced and forced to start all over again, far away from home.\nThe Curve Theatre in Leicester is putting on three plays this summer to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Ugandan Asian refugees in Britain. The plays are being written by three people — Chandni Mistry, Ashok Patel and Dilan Raithatha — whose families and friends were caught up in the expulsions. We need more initiatives such as this, which highlight the experiences of those impacted by this momentous incident.\nYet it is also vital that we understand the history of imperialism, which is central to the historical mistreatment of Ugandan Asians. The presence of South Asians in Uganda was the result of deliberate choices by the British empire, which controlled Uganda between 1894 and 1962.\nSouth Asians were brought to the Uganda Protectorate by the British to, in the words of historian Jan Jelmert Jorgensen, “serve as a buffer between Europeans and Africans in the middle rungs of commerce and administration.”\nIn addition, in the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were brought to south-east Africa under indentured labour contracts to work on the construction of the Uganda Railway.\nTherefore, whilst the forced expulsion of Ugandan Asians was solely due to the cruelty and arbitrary racism of Idi Amin, it is also impossible to understand the forced migration without an appreciation of Britain’s long history of empire.\nIt is also important to stress that this expulsion of an “ethnic minority” was not the first in Uganda’s history as the country’s Kenyan minority, numbering approximately 30,000, had been expelled in 1969–70. We must oppose all forced displacements of people wherever they occurred and learn the lessons from history to prevent further suffering and displacement in our present day.\nIt is also vital that, whilst we celebrate the Ugandan Asians’ contribution to Leicester and Britain, we recall that their achievements were made in the face of enormous obstacles.\nAt a national level government ministers launched a secret search to find a suitable island to settle thousands of British Asians living in East Africa to avoid “an intolerable repetition of the recent influx” of Ugandan Asians, cabinet papers published in 2003 by the Public Record Office under the 30-year rule revealed.\nThe records show that a “deep sense of alarm” developed within the British government, led by Edward Heath, that the expulsion of the Ugandan Asians in August 1972 by the country’s President, Idi Amin, would be swiftly followed by the expulsion of up to 70,000 other British passport holders in Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia.\nThe Foreign Office began to scour the remaining British possessions around the globe, from Bermuda to the Virgin Islands, for a “suitable island with enough space to serve as a place of settlement for British passport holders long enough to make it possible to admit them to Britain over a period of time under a voucher system.”\nYet only the Falkland Islands gave a positive response, saying they would accept doctors, teachers, domestic servants and farm workers. This reveals the inherent racism within the post-imperial British state.\nAt a local level, on the arrival of Asian refugees fleeing persecution from Uganda in 1972, the National Front co-ordinated a spiteful campaign of divisiveness and propagated anti-immigrant sentiment.\nLeicester City Council — on hearing that many Ugandan Asians intended to move there — placed an advert in the Ugandan Argus. It warned of no houses, no jobs and full schools. “In your own interests and those of your family you should… not come to Leicester,” it read. How wrong this proved to be.\nIn the 1976 local elections, the high point of the far-right’s electoral success in my constituency, the National Front had increased its vote share to 18 per cent. This history is a source of pain for those of us in Leicester who despise and oppose racism in all its forms. Yet the history of those who fought back and opposed the far right is a source of great pride and inspiration.\nIt was the efforts of anti-racist activists, campaigners and organisers that beat back the rise of organised racism. I am incredibly proud to have been born and bred in such a wonderfully diverse city. But I do not take tolerance and multiculturalism for granted. The right for different communities and cultures to live side by side has been fought for by generations of struggle.\nIssues of structural racism have never disappeared. That’s why I am appalled by the government’s willingness to divide our communities based on the colour of our skin, our religion and where we come from.\nIt is shameful that, in the 50th anniversary year of the arrival of Ugandan Asians, the government is pushing through the disgraceful Nationalities and Borders Bill. The legislation is anti-refugee to its core. It lacks basic humanity and represents an acceleration in the government’s deeply damaging demonisation of migrants and asylum-seekers.\nThe government’s Nationality and Borders Bill seems to be cut from the same cloth as the brutality and dictatorship of Idi Amin.\nThe callousness of the Bill has been further illuminated by Russia’s shocking invasion of Ukraine, which has triggered what the UNHCR describes as the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II with over three million refugees fleeing the country.\nThe government must provide safe passage and refuge for displaced people, refugees and asylum-seekers arriving from Ukraine as well as all theatres of conflict and war across the globe.\nThe government must redesign the asylum system along the principles of solidarity and decency, provide Indefinite Leave to Remain for all undocumented migrants in Britain, end the destructive demonisation of refugees and asylum-seekers and abandon the deeply damaging Nationality and Borders Bill.\nAbove all, we need our government to reflect the openness and tolerance that — as demonstrated by the story of the Ugandan Asian community — defines the best of Britain’s communal spirit.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_from-the-mullivaikkal-massacre-to-the-horrors-of-gaza/content_47.html": "From the Mullivaikkal massacre to the horrors of Gaza\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Tamil genocide 15 years ago shows governments are refusing to enable justice and apply the lessons to the Gaza genocide today, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nMAY 18 2024, marked the 15th anniversary of the Mullivaikkal massacre in Sri Lanka, the culmination of a genocide in which tens of thousands of innocent Tamils were massacred at Mullivaikkal, mostly women and children, bombed and shelled as they were held in a tiny area by troops and a Sri Lankan government that demonstrated utter contempt even for respected international institutions, including the UN and the Red Cross, whose buildings were also targeted.\nThe perpetrators showed the same contempt for international law against the shelling of hospitals and the killing of the sick and wounded. The UN panel that investigated the mass murder called it “a grave assault on the entire regime of international law.”\nAs many as 70,000 Tamil civilians were killed over a few months according to UN figures, but the International Truth and Justice Project’s analysis of census records suggest the murder toll was almost 150,000. Children were taken hostage, abused, threatened and forced to fight.\nMany more were maimed and traumatised, as the population was trapped in Mullivaikkal and not permitted to leave, forced to endure the horrors inflicted on them by a land-greedy regime that coveted the Tamil birthright and had no qualms about committing the greatest of war crimes to get hold of it. Even those who surrendered under a white flag were murdered.\nThe oppressors’ apparent aim was not just to seize land that was not theirs — it was the eradication of a rich culture and heritage that was perceived as an obstacle to their rule, including one of the world’s great cultural treasures: the Tamil language, one of the oldest living languages in the world.\nThe attempt to wipe out the Tamils in 2009 did not happen in a vacuum. It took place against a backdrop of decades of oppression and murder, constant oppression punctuated by pogroms in 1956, 1958, and 1977 and by an earlier genocide in 1983, known as “Black July,” which killed several thousand Tamils and destroyed tens of thousands of homes and businesses.\nAfter independence from British rule in 1948, Tamil people on the island of Sri Lanka have been undergoing genocidal onslaught by successive governments of Sri Lanka and continuously until 2009. Tamil people have been continuously and intentionally targeted for annihilation for over seven decades. Even today, the Sri Lankan government continues to evade accountability.\nThe political world had plenty of warnings of what was coming in 2009, but still stood by and let it happen. Instead, as Sri Lanka moved toward the Mullivaikkal genocide, the British Parliament and the EU categorised the Tamil resistance movement as terrorists, with MPs and peers challenging the Blair government if it even talked with them. Two months after the massacre, then home secretary David Hanson was describing the Tamil Tigers as “for many years … the main terrorist organisation connected to Tamil affairs in Sri Lanka [that] remains a proscribed organisation in Britain.”\nThose who escaped the killing and managed to leave Sri Lanka came to Britain, where today, they make a valuable contribution to our society despite the deep scars they carried with them, psychologically and often physically. Abisha Prabakaran, who lives in my constituency of Leicester East, told me about her own. She was born in 1983 in the heart of a genocidal war against Tamils in Sri Lanka.\nShe said: “In Sri Lanka, I lost both parents, my brother and grandfather during the war in 1997. I was 15 years old at the time — I also lost my right leg above my knee and lost some of the nerves in my left leg. I can no longer feel my toes. I escaped and fled to Britain as an asylum-seeker without speaking any English.\n“Then I went to college to learn English, I am now married and have two children [and] did an Access to Business course, [then] completed an MBA Master of Business Administration 2020.”\nThe Tamils have shown an unbreakable resilience even in the face of intentional mass murder, but their oppression in Sri Lanka continues today, and many of those who were accused of involvement in the crimes were appointed by the Sri Lankan government to oversee the inquiry, essentially allowed to investigate themselves while the families of victims and the disappeared were ignored and, according to Human Rights Watch, threatened.\nIf the history of the horrors and crimes perpetrated on the Tamil people sounds very contemporary, it’s probably because it is so similar to the war crimes and governmental betrayals being inflicted on the people of Palestine.\nLike the Tamils in Mullivaikkal, the people of Gaza are imprisoned in a tiny area of land, facing daily bombing and atrocities by an Israeli government with deep contempt for the community of nations, international law and basic humanity.\nAs in the case of Rafah, the government of Sri Lanka designated a series of “no fire zones,” where people were told to flee to avoid the bombing. This small strip of land was called Mullivaikkal. Once assembled the Tamils were massacred.\nTens of thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians have already been murdered and maimed, and more every day and their homes, schools and hospitals have been destroyed around them and often on top of them, leaving children orphaned and parents childless. Like the Tamils, they are not permitted to leave the killing zone and are being denied even the basics of existence such as food and water, another war crime.\nThe children of Gaza are being particularly targeted, and not just with bombs. With the Palestinian people refusing to break in the face of mechanised murder and deliberate starvation, Israel has been trying to break their solidarity with each other and create distrust and suspicion among the people it is trying to wipe out.\nJust in the past few days, Israeli aircraft have been dropping leaflets showing the names and photographs of Palestinians it claims have collaborated with the Israeli military and intelligence services — and the leaflets include pictures of children as young as two or three years old.\nSharing an image of the children being targeted by the IDF, Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote:\n“Palestinian children arbitrarily arrested and detained by the Israeli army are often coerced into becoming collaborators/informants, as I outlined in my second report on deprivation of liberty. Now, the situation is considerably worse. And risks to grow even worse if we do not use our power to stop it.”\nThe people of the world are rising up in horror at the war crimes being perpetrated by Israel on the people of Palestine and in solidarity with the Palestinians, in huge numbers, even in the US and Britain eager for an end to the killing and millions every weekend marching and calling for peace and justice.\nPolling shows the majority of people want an immediate ceasefire. Many governments of the global South have followed South Africa’s example and are standing with Gaza. Yet Western governments are at best standing by as another genocide is committed, and at worst are colluding in the war crimes, providing weapons, funds and military support as well as political cover. The Israeli military commits atrocities, then is allowed by Western governments to investigate itself.\nIn December 2023, I signed a complaint to the International Criminal Court calling on them to investigate and prosecute Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Galant and other members of the Israeli government for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. This week the request by the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor, Karim A A Khan KC, to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant is a small ray of hope.\nEvents today closely mirror the crimes and failures of Mullivaikkal 15 years ago. Yet there has still been no justice for the Tamil people. The people of today’s world are increasingly awake to the realities of imperialism, exploitation, oppression and murder on which Western political elites rely for their power, wealth and influence. But the political Establishment is not just failing to learn the lessons of Mullivaikkal and Gaza so that we see an end to genocide. They are refusing and rejecting them in the pursuit of their narrow interests and influence.\nThe consequences for ordinary people can no longer be tolerated. We stand with them in solidarity and demand an end to the war crimes. We stand with them in their struggle for freedom and self-determination.\nBut we must also choose political representatives who refuse to play the game of cheering on war, winking at genocide and occupation for the sake of career advancement or in fear of smears and retribution.\nThe current global system of corruption, exploitation and murder, is unsustainable and if we do not enable peaceful change at the ballot box, it will collapse in chaos. Our movement must carry on championing justice and lasting peace.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_rail-ticket-office-closures-yet-more-managed-decline-of-our-public-services/content_591.html": "Rail ticket office closures – yet more managed decline of our public services\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe government’s goal is to cut staff and maximise profits at the expense of those who most rely on public transport, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nDESPITE some rumoured wavering among some train companies, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) and the government are pushing ahead with their plan to close down almost every station ticket office — over 1,000 in all — in a demonstration of corporate and governmental contempt for the wishes and wellbeing of passengers, especially vulnerable travellers.\nRail unions have seen huge support from the public in their campaign to prevent the closures that will surely have been reflected in responses to the consultation, but the government’s readiness to enable privateers to fatten profits over the wellbeing of the public is well known, despite a large majority of the public favouring the renationalisation of public services, including two thirds for rail.\nThe privatisation of the British rail industry has been a source of contention since its implementation in the 1990s. The closure of railway ticket offices is yet another example of this managed decline away from public ownership and accountability of our public services.\nThe RDG/government plan is based on the claim that ticket offices are no longer vital for the travelling public — passengers can be expected to use automated ticket machines at stations or book online, leaving the way open for reducing the rail workforce, by around 2,000 staff, and fattening dividends.\nBut ticket offices and staff remain a vital resource for many passengers who might otherwise struggle to manage online booking processes and for the security of children, women, disabled and vulnerable passengers on the rail network.\nAnd when it comes down to it, many people simply find it both easier and more reliable to deal with other people, as the RMT’s daily social media posts showing ticket offices with queues out of the door even outside peak periods demonstrates.\nNor is it simply a matter of preference. For many, a ticket office is essential.\nTicket office staff provide immediate and responsive travel advice without technological or ability barriers and, even more importantly, are there in person to provide assistance if someone is taken ill or needs help finding the right platform if they are struggling with signs and displays.\nYet when I asked Transport Minister Huw Merriman last month whether the government has conducted an analysis of the impact of the plans on women, children, disabled people and other vulnerable groups, it was absolutely clear from his response that the short answer is No — the government has not even taken that most basic step.\nAnd it’s not hard to understand why the government would not want proper analysis of the impact of closing ticket offices, because it will be enormous.\nThe Royal National Institute of Blind People has said that the closures would be hugely detrimental to blind and partially sighted people, while the elderly and disabled people would face obstacles to their mobility that make many more housebound and less able to live a full life.\nMore than 50 organisations representing blind, deaf, disabled and autistic people have signed a letter objecting to the planned closures because they will make rail travel “inaccessible” to the people they represent.\nThe idea that ticket offices are no longer needed or justified is debunked daily. Since news of the impending closures broke, images circulate every day of long queues at ticket offices, even in larger and more fully equipped stations.\nEven in these days of online everything, people like to deal with people, especially when there is uncertainty about the best transaction and the wrong outcome can have quite serious consequences.\nThe presence or absence of a ticket office, to quote Transport for All, “impacts everything from the ability to buy tickets, receive assistance, access site facilities, navigate the station, plan routes, and feel confident in making journeys … we believe [these plans] will severely curtail disabled passengers’ ability to turn up and go.”\nAnd the government’s claim that no currently staffed station will become unstaffed as a result of the closure plans is simply untrue — in reality, the plans involve a shocking level of destaffing.\nIn the Midlands where my constituency of Leicester East sits, for example, the East Midlands Railway plan means 16 stations will become unstaffed, while in the West Midlands it will be 78 — these unstaffed stations would have only brief daily or weekly visits from mobile teams, but the rail companies and government are using this kind of arrangement as cover to claim the stations will be “staffed.”\nDespite these cuts to staffing, the train operators claim there will be “greater visibility of staff on concourses and platforms”!\nThese plans are not only an insult to the travelling public, they are a clear demonstration of the deep contempt in which capital — and its many servants in the political class — hold the safety, wellbeing and quality of life of ordinary people and those who work hard to provide the services they need.\nThey are also part of a clear trend of greater profiteering. In 2019, while fares rocketed, services deteriorated and the government provided huge subsidies, the train companies were revealed to have issued over £1 billion in dividends to shareholders over a six-year period.\nJust last year, one operator group, First Group, paid shareholders half a billion pounds in a single year — while its CEO took a 6 per cent pay rise and asked workers to take a cut in wages.\nIn the same year, Avanti paid out £33 million in dividends despite receiving a £343m government bailout.\nAll this is going on against a background of continual worsening and attrition of services, while Britain’s already grossly expensive fares continue to rise — a process that has gone on relentlessly since privatisation.\nIn contrast, many European countries have seen ticket prices rise by a fraction of British fare inflation — and many have actually been reducing prices for years.\nFurthermore, in a complex web of different privatised rail companies, the closure of rail ticket offices will make it even more difficult for passengers to hold anyone accountable for poor service or infrastructure failures, some would argue deliberately so.\nThe future of ticket offices is a key issue in the ongoing rail worker dispute. For the government to be pressing ahead with this so-called “consultation” is a display of contempt for rail workers, who were designated as key workers during the pandemic, and a clear signal that the government has no intention of seeking a constructive resolution of the dispute, despite its rhetoric in public.\nWhile the government and much of the media present the dispute as the unions’ disregard for the wellbeing of passengers, it’s abundantly clear that, as usual, the interests of workers and the interests of the general public and consumers are far more aligned than those of the profiteers and the politicians, to whom so many hefty donations are made.\nThe narrative of the government and rail operators seeks to mislead the public, but even a cursory analysis of the facts makes it clear that the goal of this plan is to cut staff and maximise profits at the expense of those who most rely on public transport.\nIt is clear that for the good of the nation the safety of the public and the future of workers must be put unequivocally ahead of corporate profits and neoliberal ideology — corporate profits must not be put above the lives and wellbeing of the many. But this is a government that has shown precious little interest in the wellbeing of the many.\nThe consultation closes on Friday September 1. We will see whether the government has any interest in the views and welfare of passengers or is simply going through the exercise as a prelude to a predetermined outcome for the benefit of a handful of shareholders.\nBased on the Tories’ track record so far, one is far more likely than the other.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_labours-attack-ads-bang-the-tory-drum-of-hatred-and-division/content_662.html": "Labour’s attack ads bang the Tory drum of hatred and division\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWhen politicians are demonising Asian men, the rest of us must stand strong against dogwhistle politics, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST week saw the shameful scene of Labour publishing an attack ad that claimed that Rishi Sunak does not care about protecting children or jailing paedophiles. The ad appalled many, including Labour supporters — such behaviour is expected from the Tories but Labour is meant to be better. The ad was rightly and heavily criticised as dirty politics that exploited abused children.\nIt was also inaccurate and misleading. The Tories are an appalling party of government, but sentences are decided by the courts, not by Sunak — and the sentencing guidelines were not written in the short period since he took over as Prime Minister. As former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal put it: “There are a thousand reasons to attack the Tories on a broken criminal justice system better than one that Rishi Sunak doesn’t control.”\nThe Labour campaign tweet was also hypocritical, as Keir Starmer as director of public prosecutions had played a central role in setting sentencing recommendations.\nFor Labour to use this issue to launch its attack campaign on Sunak was grossly ill-judged and cynical. But to make matters worse, the way in which the ad was put together showed that Labour is just as eager as the Tories to fan the flames of hate and exploit the politics of division.\nBy putting a picture of a British Asian man next to text claiming he doesn’t care about protecting children feeds into racist stereotypes that degrade our society and our public discourse.\nThis followed hot on the heels of Suella Braverman’s claim that there was a “predominance of certain ethnic groups — and I say British Pakistani males — who hold cultural values totally at odds with British values, who see women in a demeaned and illegitimate way and pursue an outdated and frankly heinous approach in terms of the way they behave.”\nLabour’s leadership and advisers might think that this is a convenient way to win votes, but there can surely be no doubt that it echoes and reinforces white supremacist ideology and the racist trope that Asian men are groomers and paedophiles.\nIronically, the falsity of that stereotype had just been graphically demonstrated in the conviction last week of 21 paedophiles at Wolverhampton Crown Court. All were white.\nDespite this, Labour’s campaign triggered an avalanche of racist comments attacking the many who criticised it. Divide and conquer politics is brutal — and effective if we allow it to work; but that is no excuse for the party that is supposed to stand for equality and justice to sink so low.\nBut of course, the Tories are neither different nor better, as we’ve seen amply in the last 13 years. The so-called hostile environment has demonstrated the racism that lies at the heart of Tory politics, resulting in the detention and deportation of people who have never known life in any other country than Britain, based on their ethnic origin.\nThe racist dog-whistle politics did not begin or end with the hostile environment. The Tories have never hesitated to inflame racial hatred to win votes or to distract from other scandals and unpopular policies.\nDavid Cameron was rightly criticised for talking about asylum-seekers as a “horde” when he sought to win votes by appealing to the worst instincts of small-minded and fearful people.\nMore recently, then home secretary Priti Patel and the Johnson government were taken to task by the campaign group Freedom from Torture and other human rights campaigners for fanning far-right hate and violence by their “inflammatory” language about refugees around their Sovereign Borders Bill.\nAnd last week current Home Secretary Suella Braverman and her department were forced to admit they have no evidence whatsoever to support one of their central excuses for the current racist Illegal Migration Bill: that most refugees arriving by boat are in fact, economic migrants.\nTory use of divide-and-rule dog-whistles is not just generic. Earlier this month, Sunak was forced to distance himself from Braverman’s persistent focus on Asian men as the perpetrators of “grooming.”\nSunak said instead that the government would take a strictly evidence-based approach – and research has shown no link.\nIn late 2020, even the Home Office’s own report concluded that there was “no credible evidence” for any link between Asian ethnicity and grooming gangs. Instead, the evidence showed that “group-based offenders” are “most commonly white.”\nPatel described her own department’s factual findings as “disappointing.” In her analysis of the Home Office report, Dr Ellen Cockbain of University College London attributed this disappointment to the prospect of losing a “politically useful trope.”\n“This looks like a last-ditch attempt to keep a politically useful trope alive. Concerns with ‘cultural factors’ seemingly do not extend to understanding what motivates white British abusers.”\nThe evidence has not been allowed to interfere with the eagerness of sections of the media to amplify far-right smears against Asian communities to the point that those looking at headlines could very easily – and completely wrongly – conclude that “grooming gangs” in the UK are predominantly Asian men.\nThe Labour right’s hands are not clean in this longer-term regard. Then-front bench MP Phil Woolas was ejected from Parliament for lying about his opponent during the 2010 general election, claiming the other candidate was “wooing” Islamic extremists, again making Asians the bogeymen to scare up votes.\nThe common thread in all these instances is cynical political expediency. Right-wing politicians have always assumed that demonising the “other” and whipping up fear and hatred are both vote-winners and useful distractions from political embarrassments or unpopular decisions and have been quick to point fingers. Tragically, it now seems that the Labour Party has climbed aboard that bandwagon.\nThe tripartite propagation of this racial smear is deeply hurtful to my community in Leicester East. It hurts our community to claim British Asian men are apologists for rapists, paedophiles and child sexual abuse.\nIt is also deeply damaging to our wider society, weakening the ties that pull us together and green-housing hatred, suspicion and fear.\nThese smears are counterfactual, flying in the face of actual evidence in the pursuit of cheap points and votes.\nAnd they damage our democracy and our politics, making it all too easy to claim that, in many cases, “they’re all the same,” destroying faith in our democratic and legal systems and discouraging engagement – in effect disenfranchising communities and thoughtful voters while amplifying those who foster hate out of all proportion to their real numbers.\nThese cynical manoeuvres put UK politics even deeper into the sewer in which too many politicians have swum for far too long.\nWe should be challenging xenophobia, hate and racism. Demonising a whole race, community or religion is wrong and must be resisted.\nEvery politician has a duty to stand up for understanding, tolerance and respect for facts. It will come as no surprise to readers that the Tories disregard this obligation, but for Labour’s leadership to not only do the same but double down on it and refuse to acknowledge it was wrong is, many would argue, unforgivable.\nFaced with this void of political integrity between Parliament’s two biggest parties, everyone who wants and believes in a better future for this country must stand up all the more firmly against the forces of hate and division and shout all the more loudly that this will not be accepted.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_wilko-the-killing-off-of-our-high-streets/content_355.html": "Wilko: the killing-off of our high streets\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nIt’s clear ‘market forces’ cannot be trusted with our workplaces, our essential shops and our communities — we need to look at worker control and co-operative ownership models, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIN SOLIDARITY, we must enable the development of worker-recovered companies and the government must act to support retail workers and to protect local high streets and communities that depend on them.\nThese are the clear lessons following the collapse of yet another major high street chain — and one on which many struggling people relied for low-cost essentials.\nOffers from various investors to buy Wilko, which was founded in Leicester in 1930, have fallen through, and all 400 of the retailer’s stores are now set to disappear from our high streets by early October, putting around 12,500 staff out of work through no fault of their own.\nWilko has become the latest in a string of lost British high-street retail brands, costing many tens of thousands of jobs. Woolworths, Thomas Cook, Dixon’s, BHS, Dewhurst, MFI, Principles, Borders, Barrett’s, Maplin and more have all disappeared, each one depleting the substance of high streets as centres for community life.\nWilko was important to many working-class households, but it suffered the same management issues: owners took £3 million in dividends last year as the business lost £37m — and when Wilko and other retailers collapsed, the working class bore the brunt, losing livelihoods and pensions, which ought to be an issue of deep concern to us all.\nThe loss of retail jobs makes the position of those still at work in the sector poorer and more precarious — fewer jobs allows remaining employers to attack pay and conditions. The number of working people in poverty has increased by an appalling 1.5 million under the Tories since 2010 and real-terms pay erosion has played a central role in this scandal.\nThese retail closures have taken place at the same time as British banks have been closing almost 6,000 branches at a rate of over 50 a month. This programme of parallel, greed-driven closures has formed part of a vicious circle that has accelerated the deterioration of high streets and small shopping areas, forcing customers to travel to city centres and slashing footfall for small local businesses.\nThe collapse of Wilko inflicts hardship and worry on thousands of our class, working in its shops, and also on millions more of the poorer and more vulnerable in our communities, who now face either higher prices for things they can’t do without, or longer journeys in search of reasonable prices.\nSqueezed wages in the last 13 years, particularly in the public sector, have contributed to a shameful impoverishment of our people, more than 14 million people in this country — perversely both fuelling the need for low-cost local goods and hitting high street demand.\nNow, a so-called cost of living emergency, driven almost entirely by corporate profiteering in energy and other sectors, has created inflation that has nothing to do with individual profligacy and demand, yet the Bank of England continually raises interest rates, supposedly to reduce inflation even though the bank’s directors have publicly admitted that the rate hikes are hitting those who are not causing the problem and not the corporations that are.\nAnd of course, all this has happened against a backdrop of relentless cuts to local government funding since 2010 that have seen other staples of town and community centres — swimming pools, leisure centres, youth facilities and more — closed by councils scrabbling to cut costs.\nThis ongoing disaster makes it absolutely clear that the decades of governments cutting local budgets while allowing markets to decide what happens to our high streets must end. Austerity, always a political decision and never a necessity, has seen these vital community spaces wither.\nThe government chose to bail out the banks during the banking crisis and subsidised the arms industry to the tune of more than £100m — yet the government will let Wilko disappear from working-class high streets, without lifting a finger to help workers, because of its ideological commitment to neoliberalism and privatisation.\nThe government allows a system in which all the profits of “success” go into corporate and private hands while the costs of failure are borne by those who did not cause it, either in the commercial sector or in the natural monopolies that have been turned into shareholder cash cows for decades.\nLocal high streets should be acting as the heart of each community, especially for disabled, elderly and other vulnerable people, yet they are hit time and again by companies either fattening already grotesque profits or folding because they can’t make enough.\nIt is simply not good enough to allow another major name to disappear, particularly one on which so many ordinary people depend, and simply do nothing.\nMillions in this country are already struggling with multiple crises caused by corporate greed and government inaction. Thriving, easily accessible high streets are vital for millions — and for the healthy economy that this country needs. It cannot be left to market forces to decide whether they exist or not.\nWorkers and their families facing the loss of their incomes is a crisis not just for them but for all of us. The situation demands action by the government — action that in the end will be cheaper than the economic impact of this and other collapses.\nYet ideological resistance to intervention is prioritised above the needs of the public every time unless there is a quick buck in it for government allies and donors. It is a story that has been tragically repeated time and again for many years now.\nThis inflation of profits while the public carries the cost and the hurt needs to end. The “laissez-faire, get rich and to hell with the man” of neoliberal politics and economics needs to be replaced by a philosophy of government that will act for the public good every time and that sees social good as more important than profit — because it is.\nThe damage done by the collapse of Wilko will be felt in hundreds of communities. The only silver lining in this miserable situation is that it has illustrated yet again that the system that has now dominated our country for more than 40 years is toxic and unsustainable. Capitalism carries the seeds of its own destruction, but we must make certain that ordinary people stop being hurt along with it.\nIt is time for workers’ emancipation; putting power in the hands of workers and communities using a co-operative model of management and governance to develop a worker recovered company.\nOnce taken over by workers, co-operative workplaces can offer resilience for the future, equity and workers’ self-management. In the wake of a company collapse, this is a credible alternative vision of organised industrialised action.\nThrough solidarity, worker-recovered companies can be shielded from adopting capitalist forms of organisational behaviour. The failure of neoliberalism is clear; we need social transformation and dignified sources of work.\nIn Parliament we could change bankruptcy law, prioritising worker acquisition rights when businesses close down. Thus, automatically increasing workers’ voice and affording workers greater dignity.\nThe collapse of Wilko showcases everything we know is wrong with capitalism. It’s a brutal class-divided system. Among the many changes that Britain desperately needs, it’s time for the withering of our high streets to end.\nThe government must act to support the change that is needed, or else our local high streets will ultimately collapse disastrously under the weight of their own instability and unsustainability.\nMarkets that care about profit instead of communities, or local authorities who don’t have the resources or reach to be able to act effectively, will never be enough to ensure that our communities and people are not forced to suffer the consequences of greed and corporate mismanagement.\nThe action that is so desperately needed could, if necessary, be funded by a levy on online giants who are amassing vast profits while communities wither. There is no sign of recognition of this fact among so-called elites, but we must not let that stop us from demanding it.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_june-blogs/content_374.html": "It is truly an honour to represent the city where I was born and raised and I thank the people of Leicester East for electing me as their MP.\nTel: 0207 219 3000\nMobile: 07973 816885\nFreephone: 0800 799 9870\nEmail: [email protected]\nThe Coronavirus pandemic, and Leicester’s ongoing high rate of infection, has reinforced the fact that there is such a thing as society, and that our collective wellbeing depends on the strength of all of us – including the most vulnerable.\nIt is possible for us to build a society in which everyone is valued and protected – no matter their country of birth.\nAs this legislation fails to do this, I will be voting against it today.\nIn nearly all cases, undocumented people are not criminals — but simply those who have fallen through the cracks of the government’s callous hostile environment policies.\nIt is imperative — and in the best interest of everyone in our country — that the basic needs of all those who are living in the UK are met.\nYou can read my article in the Morning Star here.\nAt this difficult and distressing time, I welcome the extension of lockdown measures. It is important to put protecting lives and public health first.\nI wholeheartedly reject those seeking to blame Leicester residents for this spike in cases. At every step in this crisis – from lockdown delay, equipment shortages, care home neglect, misleading testing figures and much more – the government has failed to adequately protect our communities. That is why the UK has had the worst coronavirus death rate per capita of any country in the world.\nIt is my view that the government has lifted lockdown measures prematurely when compared to public health indicators in other countries. The UK accounts for more than 10% of all deaths in the world – even though it has less than 1% of the world’s population.\nWith Leicester required to maintain lockdown measures, it will be necessary for economic support to be extended and expanded. Therefore I will be challenging the Government to widen access to the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Scheme to include all hospitality businesses and their supply chains; continuing funding support to businesses to retain furloughed staff and to allow local authorities to apply discretion to help more businesses to access Business Loan Support.\nIt is my view that all workplaces must adhere to health and safety measures, and no workers in Leicester should be forced to work in unsafe conditions. This crisis has demonstrated the need for unionised, accountable workplaces that prioritise employee wellbeing. To ensure that every Leicester resident can seek the medical help they need, it is also vital for full citizenship rights to be extended for undocumented workers, those with No Recourse to Public Funds and people with no Indefinite Leave to Remain.\nWe know that existing racial and class inequalities, coupled with inadequate government support, mean that working-class people, migrants and African, Asian and minority ethnic communities are at greater risk of and exposure to covid-19.\nAs Leicester East is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the UK, and has high levels of in-work poverty, we disproportionately suffer from these discrepancies. The virus itself may not discriminate, but our economic and social system certainly does.\nI strongly encourage everyone to keep taking the safety precautions that they have been, including washing our hands regularly throughout the day, wearing a face mask in public, keeping two metres away from anyone we don’t live with and minimising contact with others.\nI will keep working tirelessly to lobby the government, public health officials and local stakeholders to ensure that Leicester receives the best possible protection from this virus.\nWhen compared to public health indicators in other countries when they lifted lockdown restrictions, the UK is acting prematurely and rashly.\nThe UK accounts for more than 10% of all Covid-19 deaths in the world – even though we are less than 1% of the global population.\nThe government’s recklessness has already cost too many lives. They must ensure that their rush to relax lockdown does not lead to even greater suffering in Leicester and across the UK.\nRead the relating article here.\nHear my thoughts on the Coronavirus in this interview with BBC new here.\nIt was a pleasure to be involved in the Brazil Solidarity event. You can catch up on this excellent meeting with myself, former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Jeremy Corbyn and Glenn Greenwald here! This is also standing in solidarity to the Brazilian community in Leicester and the Midlands.\nI am monitoring the track and trace system as it is developed in Leicester to ensure that it operates effectively and transparently. I have been concerned with the delays, detail and quality of data, and inefficient involvement of private companies in the Government’s national testing plans. We deserve better.\nRead my article in the Leicester Mercury here.\nI am proud to have joined this call urging the government to consider a four day working week in response to the Coronavirus pandemic.\nA four-day week would bring multiple benefits to society, the environment, our democracy, and our economy (through increased productivity). Mental health and wellbeing would likely improve across the board with more time available for socialising, family and community.\nIt’s in no one’s interests to return back to the pressure and stress that people were under before this pandemic.\nRead the full article in the Independent here.\nLike many Leicester residents, I am concerned about the increase in Coronavirus cases in our city.\nI am working tirelessly to lobby the government, public health officials and local stakeholders to ensure that Leicester receives the best possible protection from this virus.\nI will keep fighting for the safety and wellbeing of everyone in Leicester East.\nAt every step in this crisis – from lockdown delay, equipment shortages, care home neglect, testing lies and much more – the government has failed to adequately protect our communities. That is why the UK has the worst coronavirus death rate of any country in the world.\nWhilst they boast about prematurely and recklessly relaxing lockdown measures, the government must ensure that Leicester residents receive the best possible protection from this virus.\nRead my article for the Leicester Mercury here.\nSadly, we cannot rely on this government to take the urgent, radical action that is required to mitigate climate breakdown.\nIt is up to the Labour Party to pressure the government into taking this life-or-death issue seriously. To do that, we must ensure that our own climate justice policies are on the same scale of the crisis we face.\nThanks to our 2019 manifesto, trade unionists and member-led campaigns like the excellent\nLabour for a Green New Deal, we already have many of the policies to do this. It’s up to all of us to keep fighting and make them a reality.\nMoments of crises often shape the future. From the horror of the Second World War, we created the welfare state and our treasured NHS.\nWhilst we rightly focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, the well being of the entire planet relies on us also to take this opportunity to mitigate the existential threat of climate change.\nCheck out my article for Labour List here.\nam proud to have joined over 1000 representatives across 25 European countries to oppose plans by Israel to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.\nUnilateral annexation would be fatal to the prospects of Israeli-Palestinian peace and will challenge the most basic norms guiding international relations.\nAmid the disruption of Covid-19, the international community cannot allow this unlawful act to be pushed through.\nYou can see the letter signed by over 1000 Parliamentarian’s here.\nBelly Mujinga, her family and her friends and colleagues deserve justice.\nIf the government truly believe that Black Lives Matter, they must launch a public enquiry to examine and minimise all deaths associated with the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nYou can see my letter to Grant Shapps MP here.\nWe must build international solidarity with those in the front line in the battles against the far-right across the globe and struggling for a different kind of society, including those heroic people fighting in Brazil.\nSee my article in the Brasil Wire here.\nBritain and other Western countries have a moral duty to ensure that economically poorer countries do not disproportionately suffer from the coronavirus due to the unjust hindrance of global debt.\nThe Jubilee Debt Campaign found that more than 60 countries are spending more on paying their debt creditors than they are on their population’s health. This is a direct consequence of the uneven power dynamics forged through centuries of violent, extractive colonialism and imperialism.\nNow is the time for Britain to seriously consider calling for an end to this historical unfairness.\nOn Windrush Day, we celebrate the huge contribution that my parents generation made to our society.\nYet huge numbers of those affected by the Windrush scandal still have not received compensation.\nThe government’s cruel hostile environment policies led to thousands of legal residents being sacked from their jobs, denied access to NHS, made homeless, arrested and deported.\nRead this article in the Guardian here.\nUnemployment claims have doubled to almost three million during the Coronavirus lockdown.\nCatch up with my interview with Bloomberg here about why the chancellor needs to deliver an emergency Budget this summer.\nI am proud to support these demands for justice.\nIt us up to all of us to ensure that Black Lives Matter evolves from a galvanising slogan to a reality of daily life.\nAs the inspiring radical Angela Davis said:\n“If we don’t take seriously the ways in which racism is embedded in structures of institutions, if we assume that there must be an identifiable racist who is the perpetrator, then we won’t ever succeed in eradicating racism.”\nNow is the time for us to interrogate our systems of government so that we can end the global scourge of racism, no matter what form it takes.\nMy column in the Morning Star here.\nThank you, Marcus Rashford for your inspiring campaigning.\nThe fact is, in the sixth richest country in the world, we should never have to debate how to feed our children.\nMy statement on the COVID-19 spike in Leicester East.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has shown that the time for empty commitments and heel-dragging is over.\nNow is the time for our leaders, in the UK and across the world, to meaningfully and immediately address the scourge of institutional racism.\nRead my latest article for the Independent here.\nAfter this crisis, we can no longer live in a society defined by extreme racial and class inequality.\nThe task ahead of us is not only to defeat this virus but to build a world free of the inequalities which have exacerbated its brutal impact.\nWe are all indebted to Marcus Rashford for his tireless work against child hunger. His victory is an inspiration to us all.\nHowever, it should not be up to well-meaning footballers to paper over the cracks created by a decade of cruel austerity.\nIn 2020, in the sixth richest country in the world, it is appalling that we are even having a debate about how we feed our children.\nRead my comments in this article in the Metro here.\nPublic Health England has confirmed that African, Asian and minority ethnic communities are at greater risk of dying from COVID-19. Yet the government has still failed to outline any protective measures to deal with this disproportionate impact – despite promising to do so over three weeks ago.\nGiven the Prime Minister’s long history of racist comments, many members of the African, Asian and minority ethnic community have legitimate concerns regarding his personal commitment to tackling racial inequalities.\nTo assuage these concerns, his government must urgently publish all reports into the race equality impact of COVID-19, legislate to implement existing recommendations from relevant official inquiries to tackle systemic, structural and institutional racism, and issue practical COVID-19 guidance and protections for at-risk communities.\nYou can read my letter to Boris Johnson MP following the PMQ’s asking to protect African, Asian and minority ethnic communities from COVID-19 here.\nam proud to have signed this joint letter calling on the Government to increase the pay of social care workers and nurses to at least the living wage, in recognition of their immense effort during the Coronavirus public health emergency.\nSocial care staff in Leicester East and across the country have been underpaid and undervalued for far too long. One in four earn less than £10 an hour, and the average employee earns just £16,400 per annum.\nThe Government must urgently recognise their sacrifice and contribution to our society.\nThis week, we’ve seen renewed calls for our schools to teach the true brutal history of the British empire and the legacy of imperialism and colonialism.\nThe government must introduce a curriculum that teaches children and young people about the enduring impact of racism.\nYou can read my article in the Morning Star here.\nOn the 33rd anniversary of her election as the first Black woman to be Member of\nParliament, I pay tribute to the inspirational Diane Abbott\nA true giant of the anti-racist movement, Diane has always been on the right side of history and remains a powerful voice for equality and justice.\nMy hero, Diane Abbott. We love you. Thank you Dianne.\nIt was a privilege to join an inspiring range of speakers at Stand Up To Racism’s Black Lives Matter virtual rally.\nAs the inspiring Angela Davis said, “I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.”\nIt is up to all of us to ensure that ‘Black Lives Matter’ evolves from a galvanising slogan to a reality of daily life.\nThe shocking events of the last few weeks have demonstrated how much we need education about Black History and the violent history of the British Empire.\nThe national curriculum skips the extractive history of colonialism, excludes Black histories and omits the vast contributions that African, Asian and minority ethnic communities have made to the UK.\nToday in Parliament I asked the Education Secretary to learn from recent events and ensure that our children are taught a full and accurate version of British history.\nI wholeheartedly oppose the downgrading of Leicester General. I am concerned that it will have a detrimental impact for the residents of Leicester East and for people living across our city.\nThe fragmentation of our NHS has left all of us more vulnerable. This Coronavirus crisis demonstrates the need for a properly funded health service that can withstand unexpected crises.\nFascinating insight: the Leicester Walkers Factory was featured on BBC2’s “Inside the Factory” Coronavirus special edition, this evening at 8pm.\nIt was an interesting deep dive look at how the Walkers‘ team at the Leicester site, many of whom are constituents of Leicester East, have kept the nation’s best loved crisps supplied, and grocery shelves stocked.\nInteresting to see the hard work, energy and enthusiasm throughout the pandemic to keep the nation fed from what could arguably be classed as the world’s biggest crisp factory.\nAmongst its many achievements they are proudly ‘zero waste’ and have a thriving Apprenticeship Scheme and union recognition.\nI look forward to learning more particularly how they have continuously kept workers safe throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic.\nI’m proud to be one of the 166 MPs calling for the UK to ban the sale of ‘anti-riot’ equipment, including tear gas, rubber bullets, riot shields and weapons, to the US. Many constituents in Leicester East have written to me regarding this important issue.\nIt would be a disgrace if Britain supplied the equipment that is used to brutally clampdown on those protesting state-sanctioned racism.\nThe UK government must condemn the racist actions and rhetoric of Donald Trump if they are serious about standing up to racism of all kinds, wherever it appears in the world.\nYou can read the full article in the Independent here\nSanjay Foods UK LTD is a multi-award winning 20 year-old business in Leicester East which provides hundreds of hospitality jobs throughout the course of year.\nThey are one of the many hospitality businesses that have not qualified for the Retail Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund or business rates relief during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTheir owner, Atul, has eloquently pointed out the contradictions in the government’s policy, as takeaways, restaurants, bars, coffeeshops and pubs meet the Coronavirus support criteria – but key businesses in Leicester miss out.\nI will continue to work with Atul and other business owners in Leicester East. The government must close these gaps in financial support in order to protect the Hospitality and Asian Wedding Industry – which provides many jobs in Leicester.\nWe must stand in solidarity with the family and community of George Floyd, as well as all those peacefully protesting state sanctioned racism in the US.\nBut we must also not forget the scourge of institutional racism that exists in the UK.\nAlthough I know many in Leicester East and across the country will not be in a financial position to donate, I encourage those that are to consider supporting these important anti-racist organisations and causes.\nYou can see list of organisations here.\nEarlier this week, I asked the government to stand up and defend those protesting state- sanctioned racism and violence across the world. I was disappointed that the Foreign Secretary did not even mention the United States in his response.\nI support a ban on the sale of ‘anti-riot’ equipment, including tear gas, riot shields and supposedly non-lethal guns, to the US. It would be a disgrace if Britain supplied the equipment that is used to brutally clampdown on those protesting state-sanctioned racism.\nThe UK government must condemn the racist actions and rhetoric of Donald Trump if they are serious about standing up to racism of all kinds, wherever it appears in the world.\nIn Parliament I stood up for the many British Airways workers in Leicester East who have contacted me with grave concerns for their future.\nBA, which has benefited from COVID-19 taxpayer support, has issued redundancy notices to its entire 42,000-strong workforce. It intends to make 12,000 redundant and rehire the remainder on much worse contracts.\nIn the words of one BA employees in Leicester East, this is “immoral, opportunistic and greedy.” The government must stand up to this corporate bullying to protect workers’ jobs and rights.\nAs Vice-Chair of the cross-party APPG for Air Pollution, I am proud of this report on the need for an air quality strategy to reduce Coronavirus infections.\nIn Leicester East and across the country, pollution must be kept at low levels to help avoid a second peak of this disease.\nThe full report can be found here. Read the article in the Guardian here.\nWe should invest in people and health – not weapons and war. Read my full article in the Labour List here.\nWith Zarah Sultana MP at today’s Black Lives Matter protest.\nAs I argued in my latest Tribune Magazine piece, now is the time to end the severe class\nand racial inequalities which exist across the world.\nThe UK government must take this opportunity to address the severe racial disparities in our own criminal justice system.\nRenters are one of the many groups being badly left behind and let down by this Government. Policy decisions over the last ten years have left UK renters in a precarious position at the outbreak of Coronavirus. So far, the Government’s handling of the crisis has only made things worse for them.\nRefusing to extend the evictions ban is a political choice. Refusing to help renters facing financial hardship is a political choice. For the sake of renters in Leicester East, the government must prioritise secure housing over private profits.\nNow is the time for a new internationalism, which prioritises global justice and collaboration while ensuring that human rights, international law and climate justice are at the heart of our international policies.\nBritain, and other Western countries, have a moral and historical duty to ensure that economically poorer countries do not disproportionately suffer from the Coronavirus due to the unjust hindrance of global debt.\nMy latest column for the Morning Star here.\nIt is a grim testament to the inescapable nature of state-sanctioned racism that viral videos of unarmed African Americans being killed by white police officers have become commonplace in recent years.\nYet even within this depraved normality, the footage of George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police has understandably provoked a wave of revulsion, anger and revolt amongst African, Asian and minority ethnic communities across the world.\nThe UK government must take this opportunity to reassess the racial disparities in our own criminal justice system. Now is the time to end the severe class and racial inequalities that exist across the world.\nWe must stand in solidarity with the family, friends and community of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nWe in the UK are not immune from the disease of institutional racism.\nYour Member of Parliament working for you across Leicester East\nClaudia Webbe MP, Member of Parliament for Leicester East is responsible for the production of the content of claudiawebbe.org.\nClaudia Webbe MP\nMember of Parliament for Leicester East\nHouse of Commons\nLondon\nSW1A 0AA\nTel: 0207 219 3000\nMobile: 07973 816885\nFreephone: 0800 799 9870\nEmail: [email protected]\n©2021 Copyright Claudia Webbe All rights reserved.\n| Cookie | Duration | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| cookielawinfo-checkbox-analytics | 11 months | This cookie is set by GDPR Cookie Consent plugin.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_exposing-integrated-care-stirred-a-hornets-nest/content_442.html": "Exposing Integrated Care stirred a hornet’s nest\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe are being told to ignore the evidence of US policy influence and the revolving door from private healthcare to NHS bodies – and even mentioning what’s happening causes a backlash, warns CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nA month ago, I stirred a hornet’s nest when the Morning Star published my piece titled “It’s time to call out Integrated Care.”\nIt seems simply highlighting the influence of unpopular US policy was enough to visibly rattle some of Britain’s influencers of public opinion on healthcare.\nThis “health establishment” backlash involved no attempt to discuss the evidence presented — much of it taken from their own archives — instead resorting to ad hominem attack on the mere idea of raising the issue.\nIn my article, I cited evidence showing how primarily (though not exclusively) US health interests and those close to them are quietly institutionalising a system that rewards “providers” — not for providing healthcare, but for pruning back local GP and general hospital services, as we’re seeing with the Leicester General Hospital in my constituency of Leicester East.\nThis system, at first termed “Accountable Care Organisations” (ACOs), has now been rebadged as “Integrated Care Systems” (ICS).\nUnder its perverse incentives, providers receive a cut of the money “saved” by not treating people.\nThis is masked by a narrative that claims the primary issue in the so-called “sustainability” and performance of our NHS is lack of funds or resources.\nIn fact, the issue is one of intentional and strategically managed destruction of the NHS and the universal service it is meant to provide, while what’s left is hoovered up by private health corporations.\nThis explains why when the Tories throw another few hundred million pounds at the NHS — it goes straight into the pockets of their donors.\nThe purpose of this policy is to leave people increasingly deprived of the care they need, rationing the NHS to increase profits while the public, like the slowly boiled frog of the parable, sits for too long unaware of what’s being done.\nIn the US, this arrangement has long been baked into law, ensuring healthcare business growth in a system that is outrageously expensive for the little care it provides and that leaves human misery, poverty and death in its wake.\nDistinguished Harvard physician and professor of health policy David Himmelstein has explained that institutionalising such corporate rewards has “driven corporate control of our healthcare system rapidly ahead.”\nHimmelstein says the US needs a system similar to our original NHS. A few years ago, he warned Britain that it was going down the same road as the US — and that the ACO/ICS system is how it is being perpetrated, saying: “If that’s the success that one wants, ACOs [now called ICSs] are the way to do it.”\nIf you’re a campaigning organisation dedicated to removing private business from our healthcare, here is the cold truth: those assisting in the rollout of this deadly system — including MPs — may not even know they are growing the private healthcare industry. They just need to get on board with the carrot-and-stick principle.\nAt the same time, many have absorbed and regurgitate a narrative that makes money the key issue — far above the people, the system is meant to serve — making health services a problem to be solved not an intrinsic good to be protected and expanded.\nThis crucial narrative battle led to those online reactions to my article a month ago — a battle that many on the left are unaware has even been fought and a narrative many have swallowed, one that redefines the most controversial, popularly hated aspect of privatisation, bulldozing local NHS services for the sake of cost and profit, as somehow “not privatisation.”\nThis dry narrative allows the enemies of the NHS — and some of its supporters — to portray the for-profit closure of services as some kind of public-spirited response to unavoidable circumstances.\nThose who spin this line throw cold water on the righteous anger of health campaigners who know what is really going on.\nThe reactions to my article have been standard when anyone raises this subject. When the late Stephen Hawking joined a judicial review against this “Americanisation” of the NHS, the same talking heads rolled out the same tactic to mock and intimidate anyone paying attention to the evidence.\nThe condescension of the health establishment saw it portray even Hawking as intellectually and evidentially “outgunned,” telling him essentially to “put a sock in it.”\nThen, as now, there was no attempt to engage with the fundamental issue: that the system rewards the destruction of our services and claims it is desirable for the public.\nEven though, in my article, I pointed to primary evidence and even the health establishment’s own sources, the reaction was not to debate, but to indulge in an attitude of ridicule, which appears to be driven by fear.\nThe two overriding ideological postures were to deny privatisation — in ICSs and in general — and to deny that we’ve copied the US government at all, again with no attempt to address the evidence of both that had been provided.\nTo this was added, with the tone of the condescending academic, that privatisation — which supposedly isn’t happening, remember — isn’t the important factor anyway.\nNothing to see here, just move along and believe that the major problems of the NHS are a range of technical issues that transcend politics, so we should let the technocrats get on with it.\nMany of these respondents’ own websites show they are heavily involved in helping private healthcare companies find NHS contracts, or that they have an enthusiastic history of encouraging England to imitate the deliberate limitations of US government provision, from Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) in Nixon’s 1973 legislation or the renamed “ACOs” of Obamacare.\nSome of these critics had even co-hosted high-level US-UK talks on the subject; another think tank, in an earlier incarnation, brought in people behind Nixon’s HMO legislation to successfully influence Thatcher, then Major’s, internal NHS marketisation — a move that culminated in last year’s ICS legislation.\nWith a scoff and a pat on the head, we were being told to ignore the evidence — from their own publications — of US policy influence and the revolving door from private healthcare to “NHS” bodies created by Andrew Lansley’s 2012 Act. Solid data that their own organisations openly share was dismissed or denied.\nAnd this was not done just by the “usual suspects” of shadily funded lobby groups, but by “serious” sources that elected officials often base their judgements on.\nLet’s be charitable about the motives of some politicians: if you are told by apparently impartial sources, heavily involved in key areas of healthcare research, that a programme of hospital closures, designed to keep the lucrative areas of care and jettison as much as possible of the rest, is in fact a response to a crisis of old people supposedly clogging A&Es, who are you to say any different?\nThis selective narrative reflects government policy, and is also in tune with how that policy is framed to NHS managers and councillors — and because of who the sources are, the left, including some NHS campaigners, may buy into it.\nThat is a huge strategic and tactical error. Right-wing politics is hegemonic in Britain and their form of the NHS must be fought and exposed, not adopted.\nIt cannot be allowed to be treated as common sense, with too few voices from the left or from the public majority that backs the NHS’s original purpose, challenging corporate influence as the core problem it is.\nThe question is simple: do we want underestimated problems and sticking plaster solutions, or do we explicitly demand the full rights our original NHS gave us?\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_claudia-webbe-calls-on-boris-johnson-to-act-immediately-over-child-q-case/content_647.html": "‘Child Q report findings must be acted upon’\nLeicester East MP Claudia Webbe has called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to act immediately on the recommendations for the Child Q racism report. It follows an apology from Scotland Yard earlier this week.\nA report concluded that racism was an “influencing factor” in deciding to strip-search a 15-year-old girl on her period after she was wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis. A safeguarding report found that Met Police officers searched the girl without another adult present and in the knowledge that she was menstruating.\nThe report said that the “traumatic” search by officers had a “profound” impact on the secondary school pupil, the repercussions of the search are “obvious and ongoing”. Her family have said she has changed from a “happy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks”.\nThe incident happened at the end of 2020, with police arriving at the school after being called by teachers – who said they were concerned the teenager had drugs in her possession because she smelt of cannabis. She was then taken to the medical room at the school and strip searched by two female officers while teachers remained outside.\nIn the search, the report said that “intimate body parts” were exposed and she was asked to take off her sanitary towel, leaving her having to reuse the soiled towel after the search. No drugs were found on her possession or in the room she was in prior to the search, and the girl was sent home by taxi where she shared her distress with her mother.\nThe family believe that the strip search was a racist incident, and the review found that the girl’s experiences were “unlikely to have been the same” if she was not black. The report also said it was highly likely that ‘adultification bias’ was a factor, where adults perceive black children as being older than they are because they are seen as more ‘streetwise’.\nThe report said: “The disproportionate decision to strip search Child Q is unlikely to have been disconnected from her ethnicity and her background as a child growing up on an estate in Hackney.”\nIn a written statement to the review, the girl said she cannot go a single day “without wanting to scream, shout, cry or just give up.”\nShe said: “All the people that allowed this to happen need to be held responsible. I was held responsible for a smell… but I’m just a child. The main thing I need is space and time to understand what has happened to me and exactly how I feel about it and getting past this exam season.”\nShe said: “All the people that allowed this to happen need to be held responsible. I was held responsible for a smell… but I’m just a child. The main thing I need is space and time to understand what has happened to me and exactly how I feel about it and getting past this exam season.”\nShe added: “I need to know that the people who have done this to me can’t do it to anyone else ever again, in fact so no one else can do this to any other child in their care.”\nThere were 14 recommendations given following the Child Q report, suggesting a number of changes such as reviewing and revising stop and search powers, safeguarding children, and changing police guidance on strip searching children.\nClaudia Webbe has called for these recommendations to be adopted immediately, as well as addressing the racism and misogyny shown in Child Q’s ordeal to make sure that it does not happen to anyone else.\nWriting to the PM in an open letter, Webbe said: “It is important that all 14 recommendations of Jim Gamble QPM’s investigation into this incident are immediately adopted. Yet it is even more vital that the racist and misogynist attitudes underpinning Child Q’s ordeal are addressed, so that, in the child’s own words ‘the people who have done this to me can’t do it to anyone else ever again.”\n“What steps is your government taking to end the scourge of racism that plagues our police forces, our educational institutions and all aspects of our society?”\nChild Q and her family are now intending to sue the Metropolitan Police for their actions, as well as taking civil action against her school.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_a-wealth-tax-is-crucial-in-the-transition-to-a-fairer-society/content_483.html": "A wealth tax is crucial in the transition to a fairer society\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nNot only is it morally right for wealth to be taxed at the same rate as income, but the government also has the potential to raise up to £174 billion a year by doing so, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE Covid-19 crisis is, of course, unprecedented in the scale of its economic and social disruption. Yet much of the unequal impact of the pandemic is because it is operating in a world in which half of global wealth belongs to the richest 1 per cent and in which global and regional inequalities are defined by racial, gender and class oppression.\nWhilst billionaires increase their wealth and self-isolate on luxury yachts, workers in Leicester and across the world are forced to put themselves at risk in order to pay the bills.\nWe know that, as we rebuild from this crisis, we cannot sustain our fundamentally unequal social order. I believe that a wealth tax is crucial if we are to transition towards a fairer society.\nWealth inequality in Britain is even greater than income inequality, with the richest 10 per cent of households owning 40 per cent of all household wealth. Unlike income, wealth keeps growing automatically and exponentially because it is held in investments that generate even more wealth.\nWealth is also passed from generation to generation, and this dynastic aspect also magnifies existing race and gender disparities.\nA recent study by Professor Richard Murphy found that, over a recent seven-year period, income was being taxed at almost 10 times the rate of wealth. Income had been taxed on average at 29.4 per cent while wealth — generated mostly from rising house prices and the increased value of personal pensions — had been taxed at 3.4 per cent.\nThis means that our overall tax system is incredibly regressive. Whilst gains from rising wealth are near-exclusively concentrated amongst high earners, universal taxes such as council tax, VAT, the BBC licence fee and duties on alcohol and tobacco are disproportionately felt by poorer households.\nProfessor Murphy concluded that the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population — once income and wealth were combined — was 18 per cent, less than half the 42 per cent effective tax rate for the bottom 10 per cent.\nThe aphorism “the rich get richer and the poor get poorer” has become something of a cliche. Yet comparing wealth and income tax reveals the underlying truth behind this saying.\nThe most recent Wealth and Asset Survey found that, between 2016 and 2018, the wealth among the richest 10 per cent of households increased almost four times faster than those of the poorest 10 per cent.\nA study by the Office for National Statistics also found that the poorest 10 per cent of households had debts three times greater than their assets compared with the richest 10 per cent who amassed a wealth pile 35 times larger than their total debts.\nThe cumulative effect of this is that the richest 10 per cent hold 45 per cent of national wealth, with the poorest 10th holding just 2 per cent. This is an unacceptable distribution of our national resources.\nOur government is in effect subsidising the obscene inequalities that exist in our country. Indeed, research by Tax Justice UK found that the government is giving some of the wealthiest families in Britain up to £666 million a year in generous inheritance tax reliefs on land and business property. In 2016, just 51 families shared a £327m tax break — which worked out at roughly £6.4m for each person.\nA YouGov poll found that 69 per cent of the public agree that income from wealth should be taxed at least as much as income from work. But our billionaire-owned right-wing press consistently portrays a wealth tax as an unacceptable affront to enterprise and freedom.\nThis is despite mainstream economists, such as Thomas Piketty, persuasively arguing for the direct taxation of wealth as a policy tool for redressing inequality.\nIt is obscene that, in the sixth richest country in the world, vast amounts of wealth are hoarded away while 14 million British residents live in poverty.\nThe crises we face require radical solutions. We stand on a precipice, in which the crises of climate breakdown, rampant racial inequality and the shockingly uneven distribution of resources seem irreversible.\nNot only is it morally right for wealth to be taxed at the same rate as income, but the government also has the potential to raise up to £174 billion a year by doing so. This kind of spending power is crucial if we are to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, economic recession, rebuild our public infrastructure after 10 years of austerity and urgently transition to a green economy.\nIn 1974, a Labour government came to power which was committed to introducing an annual wealth tax. Sadly, we left office without doing so. Yet our 2019 manifesto pledged to end the unfairness that sees income from wealth taxed at lower rates than income from work by raising the capital gains tax.\nRedressing our illogical, regressive system of tax must remain a central goal of Labour’s policy as we organise to build a fairer world.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_no-ifs-no-buts-ceasefire-now/content_469.html": "No ifs, not buts: ceasefire now\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe scale of the slaughter in Gaza must drive us to make one clear and united demand, despite the prevarications of the Labour leadership, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE refusal of Britain’s political class to call for a ceasefire in Israel’s all-out assault on Palestinian civilians is one of the greatest and most shameful episodes in modern British history.\nAccording to Unicef, 420 Palestinian children are being killed every day in Gaza. Around 10,000 people have already been killed, including 5,000 children.\nMore are trapped under rubble, dying or already dead, but not counted in official totals, as neighbours try and often fail to dig them out by hand, lacking any kind of heavy equipment and still under bombardment.\nMany thousands more are suffering life-changing injuries and trauma. As well as life-altering physical injuries, Unicef reported last week that Gazan children are suffering “devastating emotional and psychological harm” with consequences that will “last a lifetime.” The appalling scenes on television and social media barely scrape the surface of the horror.\nAs well as the crime of depriving more than two million civilians of food, water and medicines and targeting hospitals, schools and refugee camps with bombs, Amnesty International has said it has compelling evidence that Israel is indiscriminately dropping white phosphorus on civilians, a substance that can burn even through bone and is almost impossible to extinguish. This is another clear war crime.\nWhile the taking of civilian hostages by Hamas has rightly been condemned, in Israel 1,450 Gazan labourers were detained without charge just after October 7 and eventually expelled into the bombing zone last week.\nIsrael also currently has at least 1,300 Palestinians in “administrative detention” without charge and more than 3,000 others in long-term jail.\nAnd in the West Bank, where Hamas is not a factor, Israel has killed dozens of Palestinians — on occasions 10 to 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a single night, making an even greater mockery of Israel’s claim that it is carrying out this violence only in pursuit of Hamas.\nThe contempt for human life and international law has also seen a grim toll among those trying to help the people of Gaza and those trying to report on what is happening.\nSeventy UN Relief Agency staff have been killed — primarily doctors, teachers and engineers, according to the UN — and many more are missing; the Committee to Protect Journalists says that at least 36 journalists and media workers have been confirmed dead: of these, 31 were Palestinian, four Israeli, and one Lebanese.\nEight other journalists were reported injured and at least three more have been reported missing, with another eight arrested.\nAt least 135 medics have been killed, at least 25 ambulances targeted and destroyed, and hospitals and refugee camps have been repeatedly bombed in the supposed “safe zone” in the south as well as in the north. There is no safe place in Gaza.\nThis country’s media have repeated Israeli government claims that these atrocities were committed in pursuit of Hamas figures; the same goes for the claim that mass civilian deaths are happening because they are being “used as human shields.”\nBut Israeli military spokespeople have said, live on air, that they don’t know whether the targets they were supposedly pursuing were even in the refugee camps that they have bombed — and that they only think that there are tunnels beneath and will confirm when their troops arrive there.\nIsrael said on Friday that it had killed 10 “Hamas commanders” since its assault on Gaza began. Even if that figure is accurate, it means that it has killed a thousand Palestinian civilians for every Hamas leader.\nAnd international law does not say that the mass killing of civilians is acceptable “if they are being used as human shields.” Knowingly blowing up innocent people to get at one or two “targets” is still a war crime.\nThis unchecked slaughter is utterly horrific on its own, but it is also threatening to ignite a region-wide conflict: Yemen has declared war on Israel; Bahrain has expelled Israel’s ambassador and cut diplomatic and economic ties; Hezbollah figurehead Hassan Nasrallah has threatened retribution for every Gazan civilian death and the danger of Iran becoming directly involved is ever-present.\nThose best placed to see the consequences of the appalling violence and to understand the wider risks have been unequivocal about what is now required. The UN leadership, the World Health Organisation, the World Food Programme, UN Women, UN Children’s Fund, the UN human rights body, Amnesty International and other groups have called for an urgent, immediate and complete ceasefire.\nAnd after two earlier resolutions were torpedoed by the US and Britain, the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to call for an “immediate and sustained” ceasefire.\nOrdinary people know too that nothing short of a full ceasefire is enough. Every weekend sees larger and larger protests in London and cities around Britain, with more than half a million people marching in London.\nLast week Jewish groups led a huge sit-in at London’s Liverpool Street station demanding an immediate ceasefire and thousands of Jewish Voice for Peace activists took over New York’s Grand Central Station, wearing “Not in our name” T-shirts and chanting “No more war” and “Ceasefire now.”\nThis demand for an immediate halt to the bombing and invasion is not limited to pro-Palestinian activists and left-wing Jewish groups. A recent YouGov poll showed that three out of every four people in Britain want a ceasefire, with only 8 per cent against one.\nAnd in the US, a poll by Data for Progress yielded similar results, with two-thirds of US voters wanting a ceasefire, including a clear majority even of Republican supporters.\nDespite the huge, global groundswell of support for an immediate ceasefire, the British political class has united in refusing to support one. Keir Starmer’s excuse amounted to a claim that there would be more violence if Israel stopped bombing. Rather than recognise public demand and work for peace, the Tories have instead attempted to criminalise protest for Palestine and to demonise those who want an end to the killing of innocent civilians.\nThis determination to ignore both obvious human decency and the global consensus against the slaughter and massacre is inexcusable. The sop of a “humanitarian pause” so that food and medicines can reach civilians before they are bombed again is utterly inadequate.\nThe excuses given by political leaders for refusing to call for a ceasefire amount to gaslighting the public and are an insult to our intelligence and our compassion. The cycle of violence has to be broken and the idea of continuing to bomb helpless civilians is unconscionable.\nIt should not be controversial anywhere to say that civilians — innocent children, women and the elderly — must not continue to face such an onslaught for one more minute.\nThere is no excuse for killing civilians, either Israeli or Palestinian. There is no excuse either for the betrayal of decency and humanity by political leaders who are prepared to allow the murder to continue. There is no time to waste — the cost and consequences of delay and obfuscation are too great. There must be a ceasefire — and it must be now.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_from-the-wreckage-of-the-pandemic-we-can-build-a-more-equal-world/content_900.html": "From the wreckage of the pandemic, we can build a more equal world\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nOur history is marked by women who sought to radically transform our society for the better – we cannot be silenced, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nOVER a year after my maiden speech in Parliament, I remain as proud as ever to be the first woman member of Parliament for Leicester East.\nI stand on the shoulders of all the amazing working women who shaped my community and fought against the odds for equality. Our history is marked by their struggles.\nIn 1974, an inspirational group of Asian women in Leicester East led the Imperial Typewriters factory strike against unequal pay and discrimination.\nIt was a key moment in shaping race and employment relations nationally and helped shine a crucial light on the issue of racial discrimination in the workplace.\nIt also inspired the union-backed strike at Grunwick in 1976, where Asian women led by Jayaben Desai put their livelihoods on the line to say enough is enough.\nYet despite the heroic efforts of generations of women, our current world is still shaped by severe inequities.\nAs the Covid-19 crisis has shone a brutal light on existing racial, class and gendered inequalities, International Women’s Day feels even more important than ever.\nFor it is we who have been disproportionately affected by 10 years of austerity.\nThe Women’s Budget Group found that women have shouldered a shocking 86 per cent of the burden of Tory cuts.\nLast week, the Chancellor had an opportunity to reverse that injustice. Yet he refused to take it.\nIndeed, the 107-page Budget document contained just three references to women, two of which were regarding women’s football.\nConsidering just 21 per cent of the current Cabinet are women — the lowest proportion for decades — this should not come as a surprise.\nThe neglect of women by this government is even less surprising when we recall Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s long history of sexist comments, including referring to women politicians as “hot totty” and encouraging bosses to pat secretaries “on the bottom and send her on her way.”\nFor all the bluster that last week’s Budget would see a radical break with the failed politics of the past, the reality for most women is more of the same.\nThe Budget should have set us on a course for a radically more equal society. Yet instead, it barely papers over the cracks created by the government’s catastrophic handing of the coronavirus pandemic.\nBefore Covid-19 hit, women made up 69 per cent of low earners, no different than in 2011.\nThe recent Marmot Review 10 Years On report found that the life expectancy of women in the most deprived areas fell between 2010-12 and 2016-18.\nIn the sixth wealthiest country on Earth, falling life expectancy should be a thing of the past — yet the Conservatives have somehow revived this Victorian trend.\nFor people of colour, the issues of class and gender are compounded by those of race.\nAs a black woman from a working-class background representing Leicester East, one of the most diverse constituencies in the country, I know only too well how inequalities intersect.\nThe Runnymede Trust has found that the poorest black and Asian households have lost out the most under austerity and are projected to have experienced a 20 per cent real-terms loss in living standards by this year.\nThat’s equivalent to a loss of £8,400-£11,700 per year. This Budget will not change that.\nThis Budget, like all Tory Budgets, does not deliver for women because it makes no attempt to acknowledge, let alone address, the sexist structure of our economy.\nThe Budget also did nothing to end the scandal of exploitation in significant parts of Leicester’s garment industry.\nThe recurring issues in my constituency are disgraceful. Garment factories have remained open throughout the pandemic, they routinely under-report hours, and the threat of being laid off without pay is often used as leverage to stop workers from whistleblowing.\nFactory overcrowding is also commonplace, and with a lack of personal protective equipment, this has undoubtedly contributed to the high levels of Covid-19 in our city.\nThe crisis of exploitation is a gendered crisis. There are a significant number of migrant workers who are either undocumented or have no recourse to public funds.\nThey are predominantly women, who are often particularly vulnerable for wage exploitation and at risk of contracting the virus.\nIndeed, recent Office for National Statistics figures found that women working in Britain’s garment factories are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than the average woman worker, with women sewing machinists having the highest death rate (64.8 per 100,000) of any female occupation.\nThese appalling statistics demonstrate that it is not only a feminist, moral and ethical imperative for the crisis of exploitation to be addressed, but a major public health issue too.\nI have been campaigning to encourage global solidarity with Indian farmers who are peacefully protesting against government attempts to railroad exploitative, extractive free-market capitalism into their farming communities which will have a devastating environmental impact.\nI have been extending my solidarity to these protesters, who argue that recent legislation would lead to the privatisation and corporate takeover of the country’s agricultural sector and remove longstanding government protections for farmers, including guaranteed minimum prices for crops.\nJust like the garment industry crisis, this has a devastating impact on women.\nFor instance, Disha Ravi, a young climate activist, has been arrested by Delhi police for sharing an online toolkit that Greta Thunberg posted in support of the farmers’ protest.\nA climate activist from India, she campaigns for clean air, clean water and a liveable planet.\nShe is now facing state-sanctioned violence for peacefully supporting farmers.\nSilence is not an option — we must all condemn this act of suppression.\nYet there has been a disgraceful lack of solidarity from the British government and the wider international community.\nWith political leadership sadly lacking, I am grateful for the inspiring women who have stepped forward to speak out on this issue — including the climate activist Greta Thunburg, international acclaimed singer Rhianna, and Meena Harris, the niece of Kamala Harris, the US vice-president.\nYet I, along with these supporters of the farmers’ cause, have been subjected to horrific, racist, misogynistic and violent online abuse for standing in solidarity with Indian farmers.\nSocial media companies and government must work together to root out the epidemic of internet abuse that plagues the online political sphere and disproportionately targets women.\nHowever, I will not be silenced. I shall continue to stand in solidarity with peaceful protesters — in India, Britain and across the world.\nWhen we look at the gendered and racial inequalities in Britain and globally we know that there has been an unacceptable breakdown of our social contract.\nWe’re facing three urgent crises: coronavirus, climate change and crumbling social infrastructure.\nWomen, and particularly women of colour, are at the forefront of these crises.\nOnly radical solutions will address these systemic gendered and racial inequalities.\nWe need women leaders with the strength and courage to recognise that our responsibility is not to mediate an unjust system — but to transform it.\nFrom the wreckage of the pandemic, we can build a world that is radically more equal, environmentally sustainable and in which every person — regardless of their gender — can live in dignity.\nThis International Women’s Day, we must all resolve to keep fighting for this better future.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_mass-deportation-of-drug-offenders-is-a-cruel-racist-and-disproportionate-punishment-says-mp/content_949.html": "Mass deportation of drug offenders is a ‘cruel, racist, and disproportionate punishment’, says MP\nThe MP for Leicester East has called on the Government to cancel a mass deportation flight to Jamaica later this month.\nIn December 2020, after the Windrush scandal, a deal was struck between the Home Office and the Jamaica High Commission that those who came to the UK as children would not be sent ‘home’ on charter flights.\nClaudia Webbe claims a deportation flight of people originally from Jamaica who have completed prison sentences for drug offending was breaking that deal.\nAccording to information compiled by Movement for Justice, some of those facing deportation on Wednesday, August 11, came to the UK as children – five of them were under 12 – and all had served their full sentences.\nThe MP said the charter flight was not going to make people safer and would just ‘stoke the flames of racial hatred’.\nMs Webbe said: “The Government will once again try to say that this callous charter flight is about protecting the public from dangerous criminals. Yet this could not be further from the truth.\n“Deportation flights have nothing to do with protecting the public.\n“They force black people who have lived in the UK for decades into exile for what are often minor crimes, destroying their lives and that of their families in the process.\n“Often, people are deported to countries they either have no memory of or traumatic experiences of horrific abuse.\n“This is cruel, racist, and disproportionate punishment that is not designed to make Britain safer but instead designed to stoke the flames of racial hatred and division.\n“The Government must cancel the upcoming deportation flight to Jamaica.”\nA spokeswoman for the Home Office told LeicestershireLive: “We make no apology for seeking to remove those with no right to remain in the UK and dangerous foreign criminals.\n“That is why we regularly operate charter flights to different countries – to remove foreign offenders, and those who have no right to be in the country but refused or failed to leave voluntarily.\n“This flight is not linked to the Windrush Review or the wrongs that the Windrush Generation faced, none of those to be deported are British Citizens, British Nationals or members of the Windrush generation.\n“Our new Nationality and Borders Bill will create an immigration system that is fair but firm, welcoming those in genuine need but cracking down on those who come to the UK illegally.”\nThe Windrush scandal erupted in 2018 when at least 83 British citizens, mostly from the Caribbean, were wrongly detained and deported despite having the right to live in Britain. Others were threatened with deportation or denied the right to return here.\nMany lost homes and jobs and were denied access to healthcare and benefits.\nThe Empire Windrush was a ship that brought many Caribbean immigrants to the UK in 1948.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

To give one example from Leicester, in one recent week the success rate of our privatised contact system was just 55.5 per cent — and this had decreased by more than 5 per cent on the previous month.\nThat means that, in one week alone, nearly 700 Leicester residents who may have been exposed to the virus were not informed, and therefore did not self-isolate.\nAs the member of Parliament for one of the most diverse areas of Britain, I am especially concerned by the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nJust weeks ago, the government was warned by its own expert advisory committee that, unless it introduced a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, there would be catastrophic consequences.\nThe group of scientific experts specifically warned that the second wave of the virus would ‘“fall disproportionately on the frailest in our society, but also those on lower incomes and BAME communities.”\nThe fact that the government ignored this clear scientific advice is a scandal and demonstrates its contempt towards the working class and African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nRecently published research by the Universities of Leicester and Nottingham supported by the National Institute for Health Research found that people of black ethnicity are twice as likely and Asians were 1.5 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19, compared with white individuals.\nThe data also showed that those of Asian ethnicities may be twice as likely to be admitted to an intensive therapy unit, compared with those who were white.\nPerhaps most importantly, their findings suggest that the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and Asian communities is mainly attributable to increased risk of infection in these communities.\nThe report cited risks including the greater likelihood of living in larger household sizes comprised of multiple generations; having lower socioeconomic status, which may increase the likelihood of living in overcrowded households; and being employed in front-line roles where working from home is not an option.\nIndeed, the proportion of intensive care beds filled with Covid-19 patients from African, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds is back at the level it had been during the first peak — despite pledges from the government to learn lessons and protect the vulnerable.\nIt must urgently act to repair this broken promise.\nNews of the possible breakthrough on the vaccine will give hope to millions that there is light at the end of the tunnel.\nThe whole country has made extraordinary sacrifices during this pandemic.\nThere is still a long way to go, but after a long, tough year this news should be welcomed.\nYet despite the government suggesting the vaccine could be available in a matter of weeks there is no published plan for its rollout.\nThe government’s many failures, such as relying on a top-down privatised contract-tracing approach and delays with testing, mean there are added questions about whether it has learned the right lessons.\nIt is the responsibility of those of us on the left to push for a vaccine to be distributed based on need, not the ability to pay.\nThis is relevant at a national and international level, as it is crucial that poorer countries in the global south are not denied access to vaccines.\nThis crisis has disproportionately affected working-class and African, Asian and minority ethnic communities — and it is vital that we ensure these groups are not marginalised when it comes to receiving a vaccine.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-can-no-longer-live-in-a-society-defined-by-extreme-inequality/content_884.html": "We can no longer live in a society defined by extreme inequality\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe strikes must be the beginning of a mass movement in this country against our broken economic model, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nBRITAIN is facing a series of interlocking crises that are hitting working-class people the hardest.\nLast week, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that UK inflation has risen above 10 per cent for the first time in 40 years, driven by soaring prices for food and fuel as households come under mounting pressure from the cost-of-living crisis.\nIt is only the fourth time in 70 years that inflation has breached the 10 per cent threshold.\nHouseholds are expected to come under further pressure this autumn from a fresh rise in energy bills, which the Bank of England forecasts will drive inflation above 13 per cent and trigger a long recession.\nThis is a national emergency. A new study by the University of York predicts that two-thirds of all UK households will be trapped in fuel poverty by January 2023 — with 18 million families, or 45 million people, forced to choose between heating their home or going hungry.\nLast week also saw another spike in the climate emergency — as droughts were officially declared across Britain due to extreme, climate change-driven heat.\nIn the face of this dystopian development, we have a Tory leadership contest in which both candidates are refusing to take the necessary action to combat poverty and climate change and protect families across Britain.\nThe only real “solution” offered by both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak is to cut tax. Yet this Thatcherite fantasy will only deepen inequality and poverty.\nUnder their plans the billionaires, large corporations and super-rich that this government truly represents will continue to pay a lower rate of tax than people who are struggling to make ends meet.\nFor all their empty talk of levelling up, the Conservatives are continuing to rig the economy in favour of the privileged few.\nThe next prime minister must raise their ambition by setting a fuel poverty eradication target, as well as a commitment to end all forms of poverty for good.\nThis can be achieved by raising taxes on those who can afford it most — the super-rich and big businesses. Failing energy companies must be brought into common ownership and we must end the privatisation rip-off with the full nationalisation of all essential services.\nThis crisis is not one that will be felt equally. Poorer households already pay as much as 50 per cent more on their utility bills than the wealthiest.\nAs the inspiring James Baldwin once said: “Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.”\nAfter half a century of privatisation and increasing inequality, too many people are forced to live pay cheque to pay cheque — meaning they are always teetering precariously over a financial cliff-edge.\nAfrican, African-Caribbean, Asian and other racialised groups, who are disproportionately poorly paid, will be hit the hardest by this crisis.\nWhile so many of us have suffered, billionaires and the super-rich have increased their obscene fortunes in recent years.\nYet this government only raises funds by squeezing the struggling many while allowing the astronomical wealth of the few to continually grow.\nWe can no longer live in a society defined by extreme inequality. The government must act now to end the cost-of-living crisis and prevent the further impoverishment of the working class.\nFor starters, it must introduce energy price freezes, as well as freezes on rents and basic food costs — funded by a wealth tax on the super-rich.\nA £15 minimum wage must be introduced, immediately. It must also look to Europe, where governments in Spain and Germany have introduced full rail travel for as little as €9 a month to combat the climate and cost-of-living crises.\nYet this must be the bare minimum — we require a radical transformation in this country along the lines of equality and justice.\nThis summer has seen the largest wave of industrial action for decades. Let us hope that this is the moment the working class in this country realises its strength and power.\nThe strikes must be the beginning of a mass movement in this country against our broken economic model, which preserves the obscene wealth of the few at the expense of the basic necessities of the many. A general strike must be considered as a viable option to prevent more workers from falling into poverty.\nWorryingly, we currently have two Thatcherite tribute acts vying to replace Boris Johnson in No 10. It is clear they wish to strike another devastating blow to the labour movement.\nYet during an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis and with record inflation the working class of this country have simply had enough.\nThey will not take the obscene wealth inequality in this country lying down. Nor will they listen to this government of the super-rich, try to justify the grotesquely uneven wealth of the select few while more and more people struggle to afford the basic necessities upon which they need to survive.\nThat’s why I am incredibly grateful to all striking union members who are bravely asserting the collective power of the working class.\nWe must continue to stand in full solidarity with all striking workers, and to learn from their example with continued trade union mobilisation until every worker in the country has a job upon which they can build a happy and stable life.\nFar from the vilification we have seen over the last week from the government and the billionaire-owned press, it is important for us to celebrate everything that the trade union movement has fought for and won.\nFrom fairer pay to weekends, everything that makes the lives of workers tolerable has been won by generations of struggle.\nWe on the left need to remain committed to not only helping those impacted by the cost-of-living crisis, but also to outlining a clear radical vision for a fairer and better society.\nPolicies such as a radical green new deal, scrapping universal credit, and extending public ownership are popular with the public, and must be developed.\nDespite what the billionaire-owned press might say, public ownership policies are not unpopular. A clear majority of the British public believe that mail, rail, water and bus companies should be run in the public interest — not for private profit.\nWe must also give full support to all those young people and others who will continue to engage in direct action to highlight the need to tackle the climate emergency, while also building support for a Green New Deal and socialist solutions to climate chaos.\nBecause the climate crisis lays bare the delusion of moderate politics being the “safe,” “sensible” option. Only rapid, collective action will give us a chance of defending vulnerable communities in the global South and allow our children to inherit a liveable planet.\nWe must phase out carbon-intensive industries while transferring to renewable energy as soon as scientifically possible.\nIt is vital that workers are protected, and that the transition is predicated upon justice for global South countries, improving living standards for all and an economic stimulus to revitalise our recession-hit economy with well-paid, unionised jobs.\nWith Johnson governing with such a reactionary agenda, it is vital that we on the left resist the Tories every step of the way, and do not compromise our socialist, anti-racist and internationalist principles.\nWith the most right-wing Tory leadership contest in decades, I fear that the conditions are ripe for a turbo-charged shock doctrine, disaster capitalism that will tear further holes in our public safety net after nearly half a century of brutal privatisation.\nWe on the left must therefore urgently confront this sinister programme by advocating a different wholesale reimagining of society; one which aims to radically overhaul our depraved economic and social settlement.\nBecause the crises we face require radical solutions. We stand on a precipice, in which the crises of climate breakdown, price inflation and the shockingly uneven distribution of wealth seem irreversible.\nYet as socialists, we know that there is an alternative, that it is possible to build a society around the needs of all its citizens and the principles of solidarity.\nThe road ahead looks long and dark. But if we go down it together, we can, and we will, build a society that works in the interest of all of us, not just a privileged few. Because when working people stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_lets-go-further-and-demand-a-peoples-budget/content_324.html": "Let’s go further and demand a people’s Budget\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nA new social settlement is needed to bring about greater equality and an environmentally sustainable future, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE government is engaged in a massive fraud against the British people, which was crystalised during last week’s Budget and Spending Review.\nThis fraud is that this government of the super-rich, led by the same millionaires and billionaires who have spent the last decade slicing through our social fabric, have overnight become concerned with “levelling up” and governing in the interest of working people.\nThe coronavirus forced this dogmatically Thatcherite government to reluctantly increase the role of the state — but even this was done in an uneven way that disproportionately benefited the wealthy (and Tory donors) while failing to protect many communities.\nNow, they are continuing the empty rhetoric of investment while balancing the books on the backs of the poor and continuing to transfer wealth upwards.\nAs we rebuild from the pandemic, the lessons from the 2008 financial crash are clear.\nThe 99 per cent must never again be forced to bail out the super-rich. The Budget should have recognised that, in our country of deep and unequal wealth, the ultra-rich and large corporations should be asked to contribute more, including through a progressive income tax, a wealth tax and a windfall tax on corporate profits.\nYet instead it barely papered over the cracks created by the government’s catastrophic handing of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt has handed tax cuts to big companies like Amazon, while putting taxes up on working families and cutting universal credit. Far from “levelling up,” it has not even reversed the decade of devastating cuts under its austerity agenda.\nThe Resolution Foundation projected that average household bills will increase by £3,000 by 2027, while those at the top continue to pay a far smaller proportion of their wealth.\nRaising taxes on working people, as we approach a winter of interlocking cost-of-living crises from fuel to groceries, while giving tax breaks to the ultra-rich and large corporations, encapsulates the dishonesty of the government’s claim to act in the interest of working people.\nWe needed a people’s Budget that seriously addresses racial, class and regional inequalities — rather than paying nauseating lip service to them. Yet this is not what the Chancellor delivered.\nFor instance, over the last decade of Conservative rule, in-work poverty has increased to the point that a job no longer guarantees a route out of poverty.\nThe Budget should have introduced a minimum wage increase to at least £15 per hour to end in-work poverty. Yet the paltry minimum wage increase is still below what the Living Wage Foundation calculates as being essential to afford the necessities of life.\nWe need a genuinely liveable minimum wage, not poverty pay wrapped up in misleading rhetoric.\nLargely due to austerity, rough sleeping in England increased by 141 per cent between 2010 and 2019, while deaths more than doubled in a recent five-year period.\nThe current £750m which is earmarked each year to end rough sleeping for the next year is an inadequate investment.\nThe government should have set in place a credible and properly funded plan to permanently eradicate rough sleeping, yet they failed to do so.\nIt is also vital that this is accompanied with a radical increase in local authority funding to reverse a decade of unprecedented cuts that have decimated communities across the country.\nThe scandal of wage exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry has been virtually ignored by the government.\nI called on the Chancellor to ensure that the Budget reversed this trend and invest in Leicester and regulatory institutions to end this endemic exploitation.\nYet workplace exploitation was once again ignored by the Chancellor. It is vital that the government reverses this unacceptable approach, including by establishing a garment industry trade adjudicator.\nMuch has been made in the press about the Chancellor’s last-minute decision to partly reduce the cut to the £20 uplift to universal credit, which robbed 15,350 working-age families in Leicester East of £1,040 a year at a time of an unprecedented cost of living crisis.\nYet it is vital that the full uplift is immediately reinstated and extended to legacy benefits to prevent further impoverishment.\nMore importantly, the notion of cutting universal credit must be abandoned — instead it must be substantially increased until it is replaced with a more universal and generous system, funded by taxes on the ultra-rich.\nFinally, with the climate crisis already here, and with Cop26 taking place, the government should have used the Budget to halt a number of destructive, environmentally damaging initiatives that make a mockery of its claim to be a leader on climate justice.\nThese include the new Cambo oil field, oil drilling in Horse Hill, Surrey, the Whitehaven coalmine, and international projects such as the offshore liquid natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique.\nYet instead, the Chancellor halved the taxes for domestic flights which are already far cheaper and more polluting than train journeys — at a cost of £30m for the taxpayer.\nDoing this just days before Cop26 is an abdication of global leadership on the biggest threat facing our planet.\nFar from cutting taxes on flights, the government should have introduced a frequent flier levy to reduce the carbon footprint of the richest.\nAfter all, it was discovered by the Cambridge Sustainability Commission on Scaling Behaviour Change that the world’s wealthiest citizens — the “polluter elite” — produce twice as much carbon emissions as the poorest 50 per cent.\nThe government must make a complete U-turn in its approach to climate justice.\nA 2030 net-zero target is essential to meet the scale and severity of this crisis. Britain must also end all subsidies for fossil fuel companies, which are estimated to cost $5 trillion per year worldwide.\nWe must forge a new social settlement — a properly funded Green New Deal to rebuild the country with new green jobs and a more just and sustainable economy.\nWe must consider every urgent and radical action, including the nationalisation of fossil fuel companies, to save our future. Ultimately, it must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs — not ordinary people.\nWe should never forget the significance of the working class. Workers have the power to shut down production of polluting and harmful companies demanding that they switch to non-carbon technologies; develop green new skills and jobs; improve working conditions and pay decent wages.\nFrom the wreckage of the pandemic, we can build a world that is radically more equal, environmentally sustainable, and in which every person can live in dignity.\nThe Budget was an opportunity to begin working towards that world, yet the government’s deceitful rhetoric failed to mask the fact that it utterly failed to do so. It is up to those of us on the left to continue fighting for that fairer future.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_afghanistan-was-a-war-without-a-just-cause-and-simply-a-continuation-of-western-imperialism/content_445.html": "Afghanistan was a war without a just cause\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Afghan crisis demonstrates that Western interventions only serve to create power vacuums that exacerbate the suffering of innocent people, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nThe rapidly accelerating crisis in Afghanistan has been heartbreaking to witness.\nYet even more distressing has been the cruel, ignorant response of the British government — which has been one of the key architects of the disaster.\nWe have learnt that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab could not be bothered to take a five-minute break from his holiday to make a phone call that could have saved the lives of many Afghans who had helped the British occupation.\nWe have also learnt that Britain is unwilling to provide a safe haven for the guards who are securing evacuations from Kabul airport. This is the encapsulation of neoimperial arrogance.\nThe rapid advance of the Taliban and the scenes of widespread suffering and chaos demonstrates the devastating error of Britain’s participation in the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.\nThis was a war without a just cause, underpinned by neocolonial ambitions, which set in motion a cycle of unimaginable suffering.\nIt is also important to recognise that US-led Western military interference has been ongoing in Afghanistan for 40 years.\nThe crisis in Afghanistan demonstrates that Western interventions only serve to create power vacuums that exacerbate the suffering of innocent people.\nThe racism and Islamophobia of such military interventions also cannot be ignored. Neither can the enduring legacy of the British empire which left a legacy of instability in the region that persists to this day.\nBritish interference in Afghanistan stretches back to the so-called “Great Game” in which the Russian and British empires fought for control over Afghanistan and neighbouring territories during the 19th century.\nThere were three Anglo-Afghan wars between 1839 and 1919, during which the British empire repeatedly invaded the country and controlled Afghanistan’s foreign affairs.\nThe current crisis in the country must be seen in this historical context, in which Western powers still believe they can act with impunity in a region from which they have violently extracted resources for centuries.\nThe economic incentives of these violent adventures also must be considered. An investigation by The Intercept found that defence stocks outperformed the stock market overall by 58 per cent during the Afghanistan war.\nThe top five defence contractors — Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics — have profited handsomely from the 20 years of suffering.\nTherefore, while the war has been an unmitigated failure at a political, moral and military level, it has been a success for a handful of wealthy shareholders. We cannot allow such profiteering from misery and suffering to continue.\nThe defeat of the US and British militaries in Afghanistan means that this intervention joins those in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen as a calamity that has cost tens of thousands of lives and vast resources to no purpose. It is time that these neocolonial interventions and forever wars are abandoned for good.\nConsidering Britain’s role in destabilising Afghanistan and the wider region, we now have a unique obligation to welcome as many refugees as possible from the country by providing safe, open passages, rapidly processing asylum claims and supporting existing Afghan asylum-seekers in Britain.\nThe images of Afghans risking their lives to flee the country are dreadful and reflect the utter failure of Western interventions, the desperation of refugees and asylum-seekers and the heartlessness of this government’s approach to and demonisation of asylum-seekers and refugees.\nSimply put, you do not cling to the outside of a moving plane if your need for asylum is not genuine.\nThe government’s plan to accept 20,000 refugees over a five-year period is simply not good enough.\nCanada, for example, is welcoming 20,000 this year alone — while it is expected the UK will only accept 5,000 refugees by the end of 2021.\nIt is especially concerning that 20,000 is the same number of Syrian refugees that the UK has allowed entry, even though Afghanistan has a population twice that of Syria.\nWe must abandon these arbitrary limits and instead accept refugees and asylum-seekers based on need.\nThe government must put in place specific safe and legal asylum routes and help support Afghans who are fleeing to neighbouring states.\nIt is especially vital that we provide routes for family reunion and permanent settlement for Afghan nationals who are currently working and studying in Britain.\nRather than processing asylum claims before arriving in Britain, the government must consider introducing an “arrive first, process later” policy to address this crisis with the urgency it demands.\nIt is also essential that all Afghan nationals are released from immigration deportation detention centres, given the inability to carry out removals safely, and that the safe return of all recent Afghan deportees is secured.\nI am gravely concerned that it was reported in the Sunday Times that the Home Office does not want to grant asylum to Afghans fleeing violence “because of the message it will send to other refugees.”\nThis callous approach must be abandoned, along with the devastating Nationalities and Borders Bill, which is excessively cruel to asylum-seekers, and replaced by a fair and welcoming asylum system.\nDue to the government’s inadequate support, many Afghan refugees will be forced to try and claim asylum by navigating the unnecessarily onerous system introduced by the appalling Nationalities and Borders Bill.\nThis is the unforgivable pattern of Western neocolonialism. With one hand Britain drops bombs and creates the conditions that drive the mass displacement of people, and with the other they create unmanageably strict asylum systems that prevent vulnerable people from safely fleeing the chaos that the West has created.\nIt is a cruel, deadly cycle that we cannot allow to continue in our name.\nThere is also a real risk of a humanitarian disaster, particularly for women and girls.\nIt is utterly shameful that the government has slashed development support to the country by 45 per cent just as it faces a grave crisis.\nThe government must restore foreign aid spending to 0.7 per cent, as this has a crucial role in supporting wider humanitarian work within Afghanistan and the region.\nBritain must also show it is taking immediate steps to ensure aid can reach those in need, end all arms sales that can be used against Afghan civilians and prevent a humanitarian crisis.\nWe must support and assist all those fleeing the incoming Taliban regime, in particular those who have aided and assisted international efforts to provide ongoing humanitarian assistance and support.\nIt is also vital that the British government calls on the international community to put pressure on the new regime in Afghanistan to respect all religious minorities, journalists, trade union leaders and LGBT+ people while simultaneously providing safe routes of escape for such groups.\nIndeed, it is vital that the British government is consistent over human rights.\nIt is welcome that the inhumane, discriminatory practices of the Taliban have been widely condemned. Yet this same lofty condemnation cannot be found when it comes to Britain’s geopolitical and economic allies such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Gulf oil states who have an equally shocking human rights record.\nNeither can it be found when the government introduces legislation — such as the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill — that disproportionately affects British residents, especially women and African, African-Caribbean, Asian and other racialised communities.\nHuman rights and equality must become unshakable principles of governance, not reduced to tools of political convenience.\nAbove all else, the government must learn the lessons of the failed forever wars of intervention and turn to international co-operation as the means of resolving conflict.\nThe “war on terror,” which was only ever a pretext to expand extractive practices abroad and clamp down on civil liberties at home, must now be consigned to the dustbin of history — along with all other neocolonial projects.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_windrush-75-the-fight-to-honour-a-generations-legacy-is-still-far-from-over/content_219.html": "Windrush 75 – the fight to honour a generation’s legacy is still far from over\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe government’s obfuscation, evasiveness and delay since the Windrush scandal was exposed makes clear that those in power cannot be trusted to do the right thing, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHIS week marks the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Empire Windrush at Tilbury Dock on June 22 1948, which started the process, which continued until 1971, of pioneers from all over the Caribbean paving the way to support and meet the needs of a nation recovering from war.\nBritain invited them to help in the aftermath of World War II, and in solidarity they came.\nMy own family were among that generation. My parents arrived from the Caribbean Island of Nevis and settled in Leicester and, like others of their generation, made huge sacrifices to build the Britain we know today.\nThe arrival of the Windrush generation was not just vital for the history of black communities, but for the whole of Britain.\nIt emboldens black history as British history, and its lessons are important for all of us.\nBut this week also marks 75 years of discrimination and scandal. Within a few years British firms would be actively seeking overseas workers from the Caribbean and elsewhere, but when the Windrush first docked, then-secretary of state for the colonies Sir Arthur Creech Jones wrote a Cabinet memorandum noting that the British government was strongly opposed to immigration.\nTragically, that opposition and the racism that underlies it has persisted now for generations.\nThe Windrush scandal brought the issue of the Conservative government’s 2012 “hostile environment” policy to the public’s attention in 2018.\nUnder the policy, landlords, employers, service providers, banks, schools and other institutions became state-sanctioned immigration enforcement officers.\nThe policy led to many of the Windrush generation who came in the ’50s and ’60s as children, without documentation, being classed as “illegal immigrants” and denied access to medical care, benefits, housing and employment.\nMany have been detained and even deported, despite having lived in Britain for most of their lives. Many lost their homes and livelihoods. They lived in fear and were frightened, they hid and they struggled to survive.\nTheir mistreatment, through no fault of their own, had a significant impact on their mental health, causing stress, anxiety and depression.\nThe attitudes that underlie this discriminatory and oppressive policy that disproportionately impacted people of the Caribbean are deeply rooted in the colonial mindset that persists among the political, corporate and media elite.\nThe “naked violence” of colonialism that Frantz Fanon identified may have metamorphosed at least partly into a subtler form, but his principle that it must be met with equally resolute resistance applies as much now as when he wrote it.\nThis week presents an opportunity to foster that resistance. The struggles and achievements of the Windrush generation and their descendants are representative of the global struggle of the working class for equality and justice and the need to continue to critically examine the social, economic and political context that shaped their experiences and remind us of the centrality of solidarity and collective action.\nThe exposure of the Windrush scandal eventually forced the government to make a headline U-turn and pay compensation to the victims of its racism.\nBut the government has put control of the compensation scheme in the hands of the Home Office — the same body whose racist conduct created the scandal in the first place.\nThe so called “independent” compensation administrator answers directly to the Home Secretary, and the scheme has moved glacially slowly, torturing applicants through an overly complex process, requiring huge amounts of information they don’t have, keeping claimants waiting years and leading to dozens of people dying before receiving the payments they were owed.\nIn May 2021 a second National Audit Office investigation specifically into the compensation scheme, drew attention to the low number of claims received and the length of time taken to process claims.\nA report by the parliamentary public accounts committee found the Windrush compensation scheme too complex for victims to engage with.\nAccording to new data published by Human Rights Watch, victims of the Windrush scandal are still facing long waits and inadequate offers for compensation more than five years after the scandal was first uncovered.\nTo date, according to the Home Office’s own fact sheet, by the end of January 2023, 100 claimants had received compensation offers of over £100,000, 677 had received offers of between £30,000 and £100,000 and 806 claimants had received offers of less than £30,000.\nYet these numbers are well below the original estimates of all those who might be eligible, which the Home Office put at 11,500, while the National Audit Office put it at 15,000.\nThe official independent review by Wendy Williams into the Windrush scandal, published in March 2020, identified “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race” and laid bare the inherent racism of the British state.\nIn April 2022, a Home Office report was leaked, which stated that the origins of the “deep-rooted racism of the Windrush scandal” lie in the fact that “during the period 1950-1981, every single piece of immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and work in the UK.”\nThis report has never been made public and every freedom of information request to the Home Office regarding its publication has been denied.\nJust this week the government has announced that the unit established to reform the Home Office following the Windrush scandal is to be disbanded, with Home Secretary Suella Braverman saying that it is “time to move on.”\nThe Windrush scandal serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle for justice; the government’s obfuscation, evasiveness and delay since the scandal was exposed makes clear how those in power cannot be trusted to do the right thing even when they have been caught in the act.\nDiscrimination and injustice pursue the Windrush generation even in retirement. Those who worked hard for the benefit of Britain and then retire to their country of birth have seen their pensions frozen at the lowest possible point.\nThe campaign group, End Frozen Pensions, has highlighted that the policy applies to almost every Caribbean country and extends to many countries in Africa and elsewhere.\nIt is an injustice so extreme that many have campaigned against it, yet the government has said it has no intention of changing it and even declined to assess the information from a recent all-party parliamentary group inquiry into the issue, claiming any change would place an unsustainable strain on public spending, even though the government’s own analysis in 2019 said the cost of uprating pensions for all UK pensioners globally would be around £640 million a year — approximately 0.3 per cent of the UK pensions budget.\nThe economic exploitation experienced by the Windrush generation also shines a light on the exploitation of all working-class and disadvantaged communities.\nMany Caribbean migrants came to Britain with high hopes of economic opportunities, only to find themselves in low-paid jobs and subjected to abuse and poor working conditions, which continues to this day.\nOur fight must encompass not only the rectification of past wrongs but also the creation of a society that is fair, inclusive and committed to addressing systemic racism and discrimination.\nOur collective response must be to reject this government’s attempts to exploit us and divide us and in solidarity, work towards a world free of racial and class inequalities.\nThe 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush generation is an opportunity for us to remind ourselves what we stand for and what we must stand unflinchingly against.\nAnd we must fight not only to tear down every structure set up to divide, to weaken and exploit.\nWe must build the better country and world that we know can be. One place to start that building, as we remember the arrival of the Windrush generation and all who followed, is to advocate for a fairer and more humane immigration system that recognises the contributions of migrants and ensures their rights and welfare.\nIn honouring the courage, resilience and contributions of the Caribbean migrants who helped to shaped modern Britain, we must set our faces against every manifestation of racial and class prejudice, refusing to settle for less than an end to exploitation, systemic racism and discrimination as we continue to fight for an end to racial injustice in the interests of our class.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_child-poverty-is-appalling-and-discriminatory-no-party-unwilling-to-commit-to-fixing-it-is-fit-to-govern/content_167.html": "Child poverty is appalling and discriminatory – no party unwilling to commit to fixing it is fit to govern\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nYears of neoliberal capitalism have poisoned our societies since the 1980s, driving down pay and causing misery for families up and down Britain, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTO THE UK’s deep shame, 4.3 million children are now living in poverty. This is a record figure — and an increase of 100,000 children in just the last 12 months. Inequality is hard-baked into the British economy and is becoming ever more entrenched.\nAccording to the latest figures from the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), in an average class of around 30 children, nine will be living in poverty — and more than two-thirds of those children will be in families with at least one working parent. The government presents work as a “route out of poverty” — and the Labour “opposition” agrees, as recent statements by frontbenchers have shown.\nBut it is clear that in a nation of increasingly insecure and low-paid jobs, work represents drudgery and struggle — and, for millions of working people and their children, it means continuing in poverty.\nAs CPAG notes, this poverty is perpetuated by government policy. Ending the two-child benefit cap would immediately lift 300,000 children out of poverty and massively improve the situation of 1.2 million more, in over 400,000 families. A mere £20 a week increase in child benefit would lift another half a million children out of poverty.\nThe conscious cruelty of the two-child cap is fundamentally perverse, because it costs Britain many times more to keep it in place than to scrap it. Getting rid of the cap would cost around £1.3 billion annually, but keeping it is estimated to cost the economy £39-40 billion a year. We are spending billions every month to keep children and their parents in grinding poverty.\nThe wider impact on the economy of child poverty also appears substantial. The European countries with the lowest rates of child poverty also rank highly for both economic performance and economic stability. Denmark, Sweden and Norway, for example, which have for decades kept child poverty percentages down to low single digits, all rank in the top 10 for economic stability. Finland, which has similar child poverty statistics, ranks at number 15 globally.\nHowever, while child poverty is cruel, unjust and deeply destructive to our society and economy, it serves the narrow interests of capital and of political elites as part of the structure of poverty that keeps wages down and maintains a pool of cheap and easily exploited labour, just as the Bank of England monetary policy committee openly advocates the maintenance of a pool of unemployed people to depress wages. The appalling impact of poverty and hunger on children’s education also serves these interests, propagating inequality and exploitation into the future, while providing an easy target when the government requires a scapegoat.\nThis phenomenon is most closely linked to the particular US/British neoliberal capitalism that has poisoned our societies since the 1980s. While child poverty in most industrial nations has stayed broadly stable since the 1990s, in Britain — where even in the 1990s after years of Thatcherism it was already far higher than in most comparable countries — it has soared.\nShamefully, Keir Starmer and his front bench have repeatedly said they will not abolish the two-child cap under a Labour government, even though they say they want economic growth but face a shortage of cash. Ending the cap would save far more than the yearly £28bn of the green investment plan that Labour promised to invest — a promise that Starmer has now scrapped, implying it’s unaffordable. Ending poverty is not only morally right, it would allow Labour to create a green economy, yet Starmer refuses it.\nBoth the current and prospective governments plan to maintain a system of appalling and needless cruelty. But even inequality is unequal. In every region and country of Britain, children from African, African-Caribbean, Asian and other racialised groups are at far greater risk of poverty than their white counterparts. Children of Bangladeshi, Pakistani and black (African and African-Caribbean) families are especially likely to live in poverty. A recent survey by the Runnymede Trust shows that more than six in 10 Bangladeshi British children are in poverty, almost matched by children of Pakistani heritage at six out of 10. Well over half of black children face the same bleak situation. In all of these groups, children’s risk of poverty is well over double that of white children.\nChildren from black communities and other racialised groups are exposed to an array of risk factors that create a greater likelihood of poverty, for example living in a family with only one working parent, in a single-parent family or in private rented housing.\nBut beyond these, black and Asian children face old and deep-rooted disadvantage. Black and Asian workers face systemic low pay, insecure work and poorer promotion prospects than white workers, as the TUC’s latest labour force survey again confirmed.\nBarriers and discrimination at work inevitably compound child poverty. Black and Asian people in Britain generally have far lower levels of savings or assets than white British people: Indian households have 90-95 pence for every £1 of white British wealth, Pakistani homes 50 pence, black Caribbean households 20 pence and black African and Bangladeshi households around 10 pence.\nThese inequalities make black and Asian families more likely to have to rely on social security top-ups, meaning that government cuts and freezes to benefits are also discriminatory, hitting those families hardest. On average, white families receive £454 less a year in cash benefits than 10 years ago — but black families receive an average of £1,635 a year less.\nIf nothing changes, the TUC estimates that these gaps in opportunity will take at least another 20 years to close.\nThese issues are not theoretical. According to the latest household income statistics published last week, 18 per cent overall of people living in the UK and 30 per cent of children were in absolute poverty in 2022/23 — defined as receiving less than 60 per cent of the 2010/11 UK median household income, uprated for inflation. This is a huge rise of 600,000 people, to 12 million — the biggest year-on-year increase in 30 years.\nEighteen per cent, almost one in five people, and almost a third of children living in poverty is horrific and a national scandal. But in my constituency of Leicester East, where two-thirds of residents belong to Asian and other racialised groups, 43 per cent of children are living in absolute poverty.\nWhat can be done to improve the situation for children and their parents? An array of measures could be implemented — and almost none of them are, by a government that seems to have no regard for the suffering its policies inflict on millions of British children.\nBalancing work and care through properly paid maternity and paternity leave and access to affordable and flexible childcare is essential, as is the restoration of secure work. A real living wage and guaranteed hours would go a long way toward alleviating the worst of child poverty. So would a government commitment to measurable performance on child poverty. The Scottish government unanimously passed the 2017 Child Poverty (Scotland) Act putting in place legally binding targets for reducing poverty among children — Britain used to have a similar act, but the Tories were quick to abolish it when they entered government in 2010, to obscure the impact of their policies.\nBut as CPAG notes, the most urgent policy need is to restore an adequate social security system to ensure that families receive proper financial support. We need a social security system that’s fit for the 21st century. Many countries with low child poverty rates pay universal child benefit for all children — and those countries have healthier economies than that of Britain, as well as greater pools of skilled and educated workers: hungry children do not thrive educationally.\nNo party that is unwilling to commit to eliminating child poverty — and to making itself legally accountable for doing so in office — is fit to govern.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

In a powerful statement he said “The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war.”\nOn my first appearance (see here), I questioned former US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power on my firm belief that such a global ceasefire is necessary during the current global coronavirus crisis.\nThis would create the conditions for the delivery of lifesaving aid and to bring hope to war-torn places that are among the most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as it spreads to new parts of Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.\nAs part of this campaigning effort, a cross-party group of MPs recently wrote (see here) to the Secretary of State for Defence demanding action towards a Global Ceasefire, and it is important we keep up campaigning pressure on this issue.\nDominic Raab pledged that the UK was backing the ceasefire on 19th April but amongst peace campaigners there is great concern that little action seems to have been taken in this direction.\nThe MoD has admitted to bombing Iraq on April 10 – the first British airstrike there in 7 months, and additionally Britain is also continuing to support the deadly Saudi-led war on Yemen.\nin mid-April it was revealed that BAE Systems was still flying supplies and equipment to assist the Saudi operations, and in early May the coalition launched over 100 air strikes on Yemen.\nAdditionally, some have even called for an increase in military spending during this crisis.\nTo take one example, former General Sir Peter Wall recently made calls for huge increases in the military budget, arguing that an increase is needed to prove “from America’s perspective that Britain has the resources to make it a credible player on the world stage and a worthwhile ally.”\nThis shows you that for all the Tory rhetoric about “taking back control,” large parts of the British political, military and economic establishment are actually committed to even further outsourcing our foreign policy and security to the increasingly erratic and reactionary Trump administration.\nThis seems to be the case no matter how much it costs the taxpayer and with little concern about what those resources may be better spent on.\nSurely this crisis has shown how other threats to our security (such as pandemics) have actually been under-prioritised by the British Government?\nThe reality is that Britain already has the sixth biggest defence budget in the world and it is the fourth largest area of government spending, meaning that s 5p in every tax pound is going towards the military. To put it in a very much relevant context, this is equivalent to just under one third of total health spending.\nFurthermore, the military budget has increased in recent years both in absolute terms and relative to GDP. The Tories have also committed to raising the military budget by 0.5% above inflation annually during this parliament.\nLooking at these issues in detail, a recent audit of British military activity and spending comparing it to spending required to stave off the current crisis. It found that “the obscene financial cost of war is starkly apparent, and the redeployment of tax-payers money has never been more urgent.”\nAs part of demanding our Government fully takes part in the Global Ceasefire we should demand that the government draw up a plan to withdraw troops from war zones and reconsider this recent hike in the military budget.\nPeople and health should come before profit and war.\nYou can sign the Stop the War Coalition have petition here to encourage the British government to act on the call for a global ceasefire.",

I will continue to oppose this heartless policy every step of the way.”\nThe income cut will also hit 15,440 working-age families in Leicester West – which has the highest number of families in receipt of Universal Credit or Working Tax Credit.\nA further 14,950 families will be affected in Leicester South.\nThe JRF has warned that taking away the uplift would be the biggest overnight cut to the basic rate of social security since World War II.\n“The economic crisis caused by the pandemic will cast a long shadow and government support must continue to reflect this reality.\n“Yet rather than tax big business and the super-rich, this government is determined to ensure that the post-covid recovery falls hardest on the shoulders of the poorest.”\nShe added: “The government must act now to prevent the further impoverishment of working people and their families.\n“Ultimately, the notion of cutting Universal Credit must be abandoned – instead it must be increased until it is replaced with a more universal and generous system, funded by taxes on the ultra-rich.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-vaccine-must-be-distributed-equally-at-home-and-abroad/content_885.html": "The vaccine must be distributed equally, at home and abroad\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThroughout the pandemic, the government has proved that its priority is not to keep people safe but to protect the interests of the few. When it comes to the vaccine, they must abandon this unequal approach, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nBritain currently has the highest coronavirus death rate in the world. For 10 days in a row, we have tragically lost over 1,000 people a day to the disease, with this figure hitting 1,820 last week.\nBritain has recorded the fifth-highest number of deaths behind the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico, and each of these countries have at least double the population of the UK. Indeed, in one day Britain has recorded more deaths than the total Covid-19 fatalities in Taiwan, New Zealand, Thailand and Australia put together, despite these countries having a combined population nearly twice the UK’s.\nThis was not inevitable, but a devastating political and ideological choice. At every stage of this crisis, the government has dithered and delayed before taking common-sense actions far too late. Tragically, this will have cost an unimaginable number of lives over the last year.\nAs the vaccine is mercifully rolled out, we cannot afford any more life-and-death errors. Progress on the vaccine will give hope to millions that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Yet at a local, national and global level — it is vital that we collectively push for the vaccine to be distributed based on need, not the ability to pay.\nOne of the most concerning aspects of Britain’s vaccine approach is that the government is allowing up to 12 weeks between the doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine — which is three times the length recommended by the vaccine’s producers and the World Health Organisation. The British Medical Association has called on the government to urgently review this strategy.\nIndeed, the latest available data demonstrates that whilst 5,529,101 UK residents have received their first dose of the vaccine, just 441,074 have received the crucial second dose. With a more dangerous strain of the virus rampaging through the country, the 12-week rule must urgently be changed.\nThere is also a worrying lack of information regarding how housebound over-80s will receive the vaccine. This is likely to disproportionately impact older people who live in areas with high levels of poverty, including my constituency of Leicester East. Some local authorities, such as Nottingham, have begun to roll out a home vaccination service, and the government must make funding available to ensure that this is possible in every community across the country so that no-one is left behind.\nThe disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on African, Asian and minority ethnic communities also remains a major concern. Research by the University of Leicester found that people of Black ethnicity are twice as likely and that Asian people were 1.5 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19, compared to white individuals.\nWhen a Public Health England review published in the summer of 2020 found that people from African, Asian and minority ethnic communities were more likely to contract and die from Covid-19, government ministers promised to reduce these disparities. Yet this promise has been broken. Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch MP recently dismissed the role of structural racism in medical outcomes. If the government does not believe in institutional racism, how can we expect them to protect communities who are clearly vulnerable to the virus?\nA recent poll by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London found little more than a third of African, Asian and minority ethnic Londoners (39 per cent) said they were likely to take the jab compared with 70 per cent of white people in the capital. That is despite African, Asian and minority ethnic communities continuing to be disproportionately hospitalised and killed by Covid-19.\nDr Zubaida Haque, a member of the Independent Sage group of scientists, recently accused the government of not doing enough to make specific efforts to reassure these communities about the safety of the vaccine and not addressing the disproportionate risk of infection. The government’s unclear, confused and contradictory messaging has contributed to this lack of confidence in the vaccine.\nI welcome the fact that the Labour Party is now urging the government to publish daily data showing the progress of the vaccine roll-out across people from different ethnic backgrounds; an analysis of the impact that pre-existing health inequalities are having on lower uptake among some communities; and a vaccine communications strategy that reaches all communities and tackles disinformation. This crisis has disproportionately impacted working-class and African, Asian and minority ethnic communities — and it is vital that we ensure these groups are not marginalised when it comes to receiving a vaccine.\nIt is also vital that we ensure that those with No Recourse to Public Funds and undocumented migrants are not excluded from this necessary protection. For instance, it was deeply worrying to see reports that so-called “foreign-born” NHS workers — who have been on the front line of this pandemic — are at risk of being denied vaccinations because of internal NHS guidelines requiring that vaccine recipients display an NHS number.\nNot only are such exclusionary practices morally abhorrent, but they also undermine the whole purpose of a vaccine. Whilst people and institutions discriminate, the virus does not. The only way for the vaccine to be effective is to ensure that everyone is protected from this virus.\nThere is also concern that the wealthy and large corporations are attempting to use their power to skip the vaccine cue. For instance, The Hacking Trust, a property investment company, offered GP surgeries £5,000 for coronavirus vaccine doses. A £25,000-a-year UK-based private concierge service is flying its members to the UAE and India to receive vaccinations.\nTragically, this greed is evident at a global scale. Richer countries, including Britain, have secured over three times more vaccines than they need to treat their entire populations, while 67 of the poorest countries will only be able to vaccinate one in 10 of their population over the next year.\nMuch of Africa, for instance, is not expected to have vaccines widely available until 2023. The WHO’s Covax scheme has so far secured 700 million doses to be distributed among 92 countries — but with 3.6 billion people in these nations requiring two shots, it is clear that much more is required to prevent a future of vaccine nationalism that will further entrench global inequality.\nAcross the globe, we must ensure that the vaccine is distributed fairly and not along discriminatory lines. It has therefore been alarming to see Israel receive widespread international acclaim for its vaccine roll-out, despite the fact that the country has been criticised by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations for systematically denying vaccinations to Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Such inequalities in vaccine distribution must be strongly condemned by the international community, wherever it appears in the world.\nI believe that, as a former empire, Britain has a unique responsibility to ensure that we honour our commitments across the world. Indeed, countries including India and South Africa have called for vaccine patents to be suspended to radically reduce the cost of production and distribution. This is a proposal that the UK must take seriously.\nThroughout the coronavirus pandemic, the government have proved that their priority is not to keep people safe but rather to protect the interests of the few. When it comes to the vaccine, they must abandon this unequal approach. Instead, they must finally act to ensure that everyone — in Britain and across the world — receives the best defence against Covid-19.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_spending-review-the-working-class-should-not-be-made-to-pay-for-this-crisis/content_451.html": "Spending review: The working class should not be made to pay for this crisis\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe government is frivolous when it comes to handling money out to Tory donors or private companies, but penny-pinching when it comes to bailing out communities, says CLAUDIA WEBBE\nLAST week, the Chancellor made one of the most important Spending Review statements in recent years.\nDue to the government’s negligent handling of the pandemic we are facing the worst of both worlds: the highest number of excess deaths in Europe, one of the worst Covid-19 death rates in the world, and our worst ever recession — which is nearly twice as severe as in comparable nations.\nThe 11.3 per cent slump in UK GDP forecast for this year will be even worse than the recession of 1921, when Britain’s economy shrank almost 10 per cent in the aftermath of the first world war and the Spanish flu epidemic.\nIt means 2020 will see the biggest economic contraction for over 300 years — since 1709, when the “Great Frost” ravaged Europe’s economies, creating food shortages as livestock froze.\nThis historical low point was not inevitable. At every step in this crisis — from initial herd immunity and lockdown delay, equipment shortages, care home neglect, testing delays, a corrupt and expensive overreliance on the private sector, and much more — the government has failed to adequately protect our communities.\nInstead of using the November lockdown and people’s sacrifices wisely by fixing the failing test, trace and isolate system, they’ve been bickering among themselves over who has what job in No 10.\nA leaked Cabinet Office briefing admitted that Britain faces an increased likelihood of “systemic economic crisis” as we exit the European Union in the middle of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.\nIt is surprising and risky that the government is reducing restrictions, especially when a vaccine is on the horizon.\nThe pre-lockdown tier system failed as it did not do enough to contain the virus, it confused the public and too many places and businesses were left with insufficient support.\nIt is crucial that, during this next stage, the government provides adequate support for workers, businesses and indeed everyone in our community — which it has so far failed to do.\nIt is vital that everyone in our community has the material means to self-isolate.\nThe Conservatives’ irresponsible choices have wasted and mismanaged billions, led to our country experiencing the worst downturn in the G7 and created a jobs crisis.\nThe Chancellor’s delay in offering certainty on employment support has cost jobs. There were a record 314,000 redundancies between July and September 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nSince the start of the crisis the UK has lost over a million jobs. The Prime Minister and his government talk a good game.\nBut they haven’t delivered on their promises — and regional inequality has got worse on their watch.\nFrankly, we cannot trust them when they say that austerity is over.\nThis crisis has shown that the people who really matter and keep our society ticking are not billionaires and the super-rich, but nurses, carers, cleaners, checkout attendants and many more essential front-line workers.\nThe government clapped for key workers — but now it has frozen their pay, and it is looking to scrap planned minimum wage increases for the private sector.\nThat will hit people’s pockets and pull spending out of our small businesses and high streets when many are already on their knees, choking off the recovery.\nA pay freeze will hit many of the front-line workers who contributed to the coronavirus relief effort and who will be essential to the recovery, including firefighters, hospital porters and teaching assistants.\nMany social care workers, seven in 10 of whom earn less than £10 an hour, are also in the public sector and would be hit by a freeze.\nWhile it is welcome that doctors and nurses will receive a thoroughly deserved pay rise, these divide-and-rule tactics are straight out of the Conservative playbook.\nWe must oppose these attempts to pit sections of the working class against each other.\nBecause by standing together, united, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.\nJobs that, before this crisis, were wrongly decried by the government as low-skilled are now rightly recognised by the public as essential.\nThis must be reflected with a significant restructuring of our economy along the lines of justice, with pay rises for those who we clearly cannot live without.\nThroughout this pandemic, the government has given billions to private companies in shady deals that have led to accusations of cronyism and corruption.\nThis is a government that is frivolous when it comes to handing public money out to Tory donors or private companies, but penny-pinching when it comes to bailing out communities across the country.\nAs a former empire, Britain has a unique responsibility to ensure that we honour our commitments across the world.\nIt is vital for us to consider the impact of Britain’s colonial legacy on modern-day global insecurity.\nIt is therefore shameful that the government is cutting development funding at a time of global crisis, especially at the same time they announced an unprecedented peacetime increase in military spending.\nTurning their backs on the world’s poorest is a political choice the government has made, not a political necessity.\nOver the last decade, Conservative governments have implemented an ideologically driven programme that has left our public services weakened, vulnerable and underfunded; which has escalated insecurity at work; and which has brought about a long and continuing squeeze on living standards.\nThe lessons from the 2008 financial crash are clear. The 99 per cent must never again be forced to bailout the super-rich.\nDuring the costly neoliberal project of the last half-century, conservatives have so successfully torn apart our social safety net and transferred the wealth that workers create to the super-rich, that they are now petrified this crisis will usher in a fairer economic settlement.\nHaving taken extraordinary action to prevent economic collapse, the Tories are terrified that the British public will become accustomed to what should be a basic level of state support.\nThat’s why the government is already introducing a disastrous privatisation agenda in response the coronavirus crisis.\nInstead of yet more austerity, we desperately need a recognition that, in our country of deep and unequal wealth, the top 1 per cent should be asked to contribute a little bit more, including through increased taxes on corporate profits.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_underhand-gerrymandering-politics-at-its-very-worst/content_911.html": "Underhand gerrymandering politics at it’s very worst\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nNew election laws are a blatant attempt to rig the polls in favour of the wealthy and the wealthy and the political elite – we must oppose, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST week, Conservative MPs lined up to vote through yet another law that pushes Britain further down the road of authoritarianism.\nThe Election Bill is an anti-democratic piece of legislation that will weaken our electoral system by making it harder for already marginalised communities to vote.\nIt is a backwards, Trumpian-style attempt to rig elections in favour of the Conservative Party.\nMost worrying of all, is that voter ID will make it harder for working-class, older and African, African-Caribbean, Asian and other racialised groups to vote.\nLiberty, the Electoral Reform Society, Age UK, Stonewall, Operation Black Vote, Centrepoint and many others have raised serious concerns that this will limit access to voting, damage our democracy and lead to voter suppression.\nThree-and-a-half million citizens — 7.5 per cent of the electorate — do not have access to any form of photo ID. A survey by the Department for Transport found that 76 per cent of the white population hold a driving licence compared with 52 per cent of the black population.\nThis legislation will therefore be disproportionately felt along class and racial lines.\nA UK paper passport application costs £85, while the cost of a provisional driving licence is £34 if applied for online, or £43 if applied for by post.\nFor many people in low-paid work, those receiving social security or those unable to work, such costs are prohibitive.\nThe application process is also inaccessible for those with disabilities, the elderly and those without access to the internet.\nWe saw with the Windrush scandal how the struggle to provide official documentation has severe consequences that are disproportionately felt by black communities.\nYet the government has learnt no lessons from this glaring example of institutional racism as this legislation would knowingly disenfranchise millions of people.\nVoter ID is also a total waste of taxpayers’ money, set to cost millions of pounds at every election at a time when the government claims they cannot find the money to give our nurses a pay rise or guarantee a decent level of sick pay during a pandemic.\nIf the government really cared about making elections fairer, it could instead strengthen Britain’s safe and secure voting system by extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds.\nMinisters should be promoting confidence in our election system instead of spreading baseless scare stories.\nIt could therefore be said that these laws offer a solution without a problem, as in 2019 there was just one conviction for impersonation out of over 59 million votes.\nYet the truth is that this Bill is a nefarious, wildly disproportionate solution to a different problem facing the Conservative Party — as it will disenfranchise people who are less likely to vote for them. This is underhand, gerrymandering politics at its very worst.\nThe Election Bill will also bring in new measures that limit how political parties can campaign jointly with non-party campaigners, such as trade unions and campaigning charities.\nThis is an attack on free and fair campaigning which will see significant changes to the legitimate role of non-party activist to campaign for, or work with political parties for a joint goal.\nFor these reasons the Electoral Commission, Transparency International and the Electoral Reform Society have all criticised the government’s Election Bill proposals.\nRather than limiting their campaigning role, it is important for us to celebrate everything that the trade union movement has fought for and won.\nFrom fairer pay, to weekends, everything that makes the lives of workers tolerable has been won by generations of struggle.\nAttacks on the labour movement are an attack on working people. The role of trade unions and campaigning organisations must be celebrated and amplified, not further curtailed.\nWhile this Bill limits the role of trade unions and charities, it threatens the integrity of our democracy by allowing political donations from abroad to flood our system.\nOnce again, we see the Conservatives bending the rules to benefit themselves. Donors located overseas will be able to legally donate to bankroll political campaigns for their own benefit from their offshore tax havens or luxury second homes.\nThis reveals the government’s contempt for working people and underlines that the people they truly represent are the super-rich and large corporations.\nThe Election Bill will further tip the already intolerably unequal balance of power towards the wealthy few and away from people and democratic institutions.\nThe Bill will also politicise the independent democratic watchdog. By dictating the agenda of the Electoral Commission, the Conservatives are attempting to remove scrutiny and proper accountability.\nWithout an independent Electoral Commission, no-one will prevent the Conservatives from continuing with their web of “conflicts of interests,” secret loans and cover-ups.\nAfter two years in which we have seen this government embroiled in endless list of scandals and accusations of corruption, this Bill will enable them to act in secret while extinguishing accountability.\nThere is a dangerous connecting current that runs between the Elections Bill, the Nationalities and Borders Bill, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill and many other initiatives taken by this government.\nThey would all not look out of place within the world’s most authoritarian regimes and further reveals a deeply troubling broader political project, which is designed to disenfranchise people and distract from the real causes of inequality and injustice.\nThe government must abandon this damaging, anti-democratic legislation and commit to governing in the interests of all British residents — not just the privileged few.\nThere is a kernel of hope within this bleak situation that can be found if we ask ourselves why the Conservatives are desperate to exclude people from voting.\nThe truth is that they know their policies that fuel greed, hatred and inequality are unpopular. For instance, polling collected by We Own It shows that a majority of the British public are in favour of public ownership, be it for buses, council services, education, energy, the NHS, prisons, rail, mail, water and social care.\nThe young generation, who have been excluded from many of the opportunities that their parents could access, are also increasingly radical — as a recent poll found that a high majority (67 per cent) of Britons between the age of 16 and 34 would like to live under a “socialist economic system.”\nThe electoral success of the Conservative Party is propped up and dependent upon super-rich donors and a compliant, right-leaning, billionaire-dominated media class.\nThe Election Bill is therefore a desperate and deceitful recognition that its long-term viability depends, not on the popularity of their policies as should be the case in any legitimate democracy, but on rigging elections in their favour.\nIt is up to those of us on the left to prevent this stitch-up, and to protect free, fair and indiscriminatory elections. It is also up to us to build the popular, people-powered movement that can defeat this increasingly reactionary and authoritarian government.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_leicester-disorder-2022-any-review-must-be-impartial/content_85.html": "Leicester Disorder 2022: any review must be impartial\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe chair of the government’s review has already been widely rejected – we need a truly independent probe that confronts the issues of poverty and political extremism, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP.\nTHE government’s recent announcement that it will conduct a review into the unrest in Leicester last summer has caused significant furore and disquiet, with many condemning both the timing of the announcement and its claim of independence and impartiality.\nThe government is correct to recognise that Leicester has developed a visibly strong record on cohesion and community relations — and thus it must have come as a shock both domestically and internationally to witness the scenes of disharmony and violence that emerged last year.\nThe location of the unrest itself occurred entirely in my constituency of Leicester East, covering both the Belgrave and North Evington Wards.\nThe announcement of the review during the parliamentary recess effectively thwarted any potential questioning that may have been raised in the House of Commons.\nMichael Gove’s appointment of Lord Ian Austin to chair the “independent” review has caused grave concerns among residents of Leicester East and elsewhere, as well as among others who want to see a genuine and non-partisan outcome.\nBoth the Muslim Engagement and Development organisation and the Muslim Council of Britain have urged the government to reconsider his appointment because of what they describe as Austin’s “Islamophobic” and “anti-Palestinian” record, which, as they state, makes the impartial outcome of the inquiry unlikely.\nIn response to the news of his appointment, nine Leicester councillors have written to the Prime Minister that they will not participate in the review if Austin remains involved. In their letter, they say that Austin’s alleged racism and lack of integrity mean any recommendations will have little if any value.\nLeicester’s Federation of Muslim Organisations also wrote to the Prime Minister warning that they “will not support or contribute to an inquiry without integrity from the outset.”\nThe Labour Muslim Network has cited that in July 2021, Austin used an image and derogatory words which they called “Islamophobic” to attack Ben and Jerry’s ice cream for its principled stand of supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against illegal settlements in Palestine. There has been no apology to date and the offensive Tweet remains visible.\nThey also point out that Austin has also faced legal consequences for his behaviour and comments.\nIn 2012, he was forced to apologise after Friends Of al-Aqsa, whose headquarters are in Leicester, started legal proceedings against him for accusing them of Holocaust denial — and just last year, he and the Telegraph had to apologise unconditionally to former Labour staffer Laura Murray after libelling her as anti-semitic, with the newspaper paying an estimated £40,000 in damages.\nEven if Austin were to genuinely attempt to be impartial, local communities in Leicester — and to date, I have received over 100 letters from constituents — will not seemingly accept that a review chaired by him could be fair or meaningful.\nBut what should any really independent review be looking at? It’s clear that the issues go far beyond the simplistic representations put forward by some of the media — with some even lazily pinning the blame on the outcome of an India-Pakistan international cricket match.\nThe review needs to thoroughly examine the real issues of exploitation, the politics of division, right-wing nationalism and far-right fascism that have been rising in Britain and elsewhere.\nThere also needs to be a detailed analysis of the way in which overseas political “influencers” and media fuelled the unrest in the city. Independent analysis already conducted by Logically, a global research firm, confirmed a co-ordinated series of false narratives were portrayed through social media.\nThe research firm found that 81 per cent of tweets that contained inflammatory hashtags relating to Leicester between September 17-21 2022 originated in India and BBC Monitoring has already shown that as much as half of the hundreds of thousands of posts containing hashtags that spread false rumours to inflame tensions and even attempting to co-ordinate protests and rioting also came from accounts located in India.\nFurther afield, the Network Contagion Research Institute at Rutgers University in New Jersey, in its report on the violence, found that “malicious online narratives … played an essential role in instigating attacks in Leicester.”\nAccording to the research, an estimated 500 false accounts that called for violence and promoted memes and incendiary videos were created on Twitter.\nThe fact that large numbers of those “rioting” appeared to come from outside Leicestershire may be a sign of the effectiveness of this output.\nFar-right accounts in the US also played a significant role — third after accounts in India and Britain — in fuelling hate, according to traffic analysis by the BBC’s Abdiraheem Saeed. Hate spreaders like Tommy Robinson were quick to try to capitalise on the events to demonise Asians.\nThe abuse of incidents like the unrest in Leicester by politicians and right-wing groups to smear south Asian communities and fan the flames of racial hatred needs to be investigated.\nSupremacist and nationalist ideologies in Britain and abroad are invested in the oppression and marginalisation of racialised groups.\nIt is evident from the information presented to me by the people of Leicester East that false claims, tropes and myths were spread from abroad through social media and tools like WhatsApp, fuelling suspicion, outrage and racism.\nThe material being circulated aimed to stoke fear, defensiveness and hyper-nationalism in the face of perceived identity attacks.\nOn top of all this, any review must also address itself to the fact that Leicester East is one of the most poverty-stricken areas of the country and to the tensions and sense of injustice this fuels.\nBoth child poverty and in-work poverty are very high in the city, with a horrifying 42 per cent of children in Leicester East living below the poverty line. The constituency has been at the epicentre of wage exploitation for decades.\nThere are too many who are not paid the basic minimum wage. The median annual pay per person in Leicester East is the lowest in the country at £20,300, according to HM Revenue and Customs statistics announced in April 2022.\nThe national average for the same period was £31,461, meaning the people of Leicester East are losing a third of their income to inequality.\nThere is a lack of high-quality local jobs and high levels of disaffection. This affects the opportunities available to specific groups, like young men, who witness the exploitation their parents suffer, which is bound to worsen unrest when it occurs.\nOrganisations to help build resilience, including statutory youth bodies, have long disappeared with austerity. It is time for the government to properly invest in areas like Leicester East, take seriously the politics of division, and stand against those who wish to pit communities against each other to distract from the real causes of inequality and injustice.\nIf the government really wanted to “develop an independent, thorough, objective and impartial process” it would be creating a review in which all our communities feel they can have confidence.\nThere have been other inquiries, analyses and reviews conducted into the unrest, including the one by the Henry Jackson Society, and another by the Centre for Democracy Pluralism and Human Rights, but none have addressed themselves to the political, social, environmental, international and economic trauma and inequalities that deeply affect the communities of Leicester East.\nAt the very least, the review must be chaired by an independent expert with a track record of neutrality towards all of Leicester’s communities.\nThis is essential — and would show Leicester’s communities that the government intends to address the real causes of the disturbance, instead of using communities for political point-scoring.\nIt should be noted that quite separately Soas university has announced its own independent inquiry into the Leicester disorder, which it says will be led by academics and have leading community figures playing a full role on its panel.\nIt is my view that we must recognise that the events in Leicester and the efforts to inflame them form part of an overall trend of right-wing groups and politicians inflaming divisions for political and destructive purposes.\nDivide and rule is an abhorrent political tactic used to split the strength of the working class — the strength which can create the democratic, equal and peaceful societies we all deserve.\nWhether in Britain or elsewhere, building unity and organising together for material changes to our societies is what the ruling class are frightened of most.\nPolitically motivated destitution, inequality, indebtedness, exhaustion, fear and alienation from each other create fertile ground for the unrest spreading from Leicester to other places.\nThe government must recognise that any attempt to use this review to deliberately conceal those factors cannot be excused or tolerated — and thus the government has an opportunity here to show some actual leadership.\nI urge the government not to neglect this opportunity and I stand in solidarity with all our communities who are demanding it.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-must-fight-to-oppose-this-energy-rip-off/content_613.html": "We must fight to oppose this energy rip off\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe cannot wait for capitalism to grow a conscience — without direct government intervention, consumer prices will never get lower and the transition to a truly sustainable energy system will never happen, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nBRITAIN is at a moment of crisis. Fuel poverty is now our number one societal scourge. People are worried about the months ahead and bills arriving on the doormat that they simply cannot afford to pay. We are the fifth richest country on the planet, we should be able to keep our citizens warm at an affordable price.\nThat eight million of our citizens were already living in fuel poverty before any of the recent price rises is alarming, but that figure is set to triple this winter. We cannot allow the push for profits to condemn yet more people to a cold and miserable winter, where cold homes place a burden on the health of our communities.\nI am very worried that the 77 per cent rise in energy bills over the last year will make the figures above even worse. We used to say that people faced a choice between heating and eating. My fear and I suspect the reality, is that people can no longer afford to do either.\nThere is also a hidden racism behind this poverty that it is important to call out. Recently, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) concluded that deaths linked to poverty are more than twice as likely to affect ethnic minorities. With nearly 60 per cent of British Bangladeshi children, for example, born into poverty, we know that energy price rises will hurt our minority communities even more.\nWe need to pause and think about what the reality of living in fuel poverty means. Poverty kills. ONS data shows that 80,000 deaths in the UK over an eight-year period were directly linked to living in a cold home. The government say that one in seven winter deaths can be directly linked to fuel poverty.\nAll this data was gathered before any of the recent rises in energy bills. In other words, this is what things were like when bills were lower. Someone needs to speak out now before the drive for yet greater profits pushes more people into desperate levels of poverty where cold and damp homes cause disease and illness.\nAnd what makes all of this even more lamentable, is that it is perfectly avoidable. We must not allow our politicians to get away with the mistruth that energy price rises are unavoidable. Energy companies paid £200 billion to their shareholders since 2010. Energy companies made £40 billion in profit last year alone.\nThey tell us that price rises are a consequence of the cost-of-living crisis, the Ukraine war or inflation but if this was the case, energy companies would struggle to make a profit. In fact, the opposite is happening. Shell tripled their profits in the first three months of 2022, BP doubled theirs. Energy companies are now making £1 billion profit a week. And their CEOs are paid on average more than a million pounds a year.\nWe often hear the excuse that wholesale gas prices have shot up and whilst that is sometimes true, we never hear about what happens when those wholesale prices fall. The reality is that our household energy bills went up 54 per cent on April 1 but wholesale prices have fallen back considerably.\nBesides, energy corporations buy their gas months in advance so they can cope with the fluctuations in prices. Put simply, it is unacceptable for energy corporations to pass wholesale rises onto their customers and then sit on their hands when those prices fall. That is why we are right to call this an energy rip-off.\nThe privatisation of energy has failed, thus in reality there is only one solution to the energy crisis and that is bringing energy companies back into public ownership, with control of prices and nationalisation.\nThere is also another solution the political elite are choosing to ignore. Onshore wind and solar farms are four times cheaper than gas and twice as cheap as nuclear energy.\nThe government’s resistance to building green energy solutions is because they want to protect their political donations from the fossil fuel industry, which have surpassed £1.3 million since the 2019 general election. Ordinary people are being denied access to cheaper energy because the government are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.\nThe government could create green investment that allows communities to build their own renewable energy projects. It is simply unacceptable to continue to ignore green solutions to fuel poverty. Green energy could eradicate fuel poverty and save many thousands of lives. Every day we remain at the mercy of big energy corporations we risk losing more of our citizens.\nEnergy independence is what makes sense, but capitalists don’t look at the world in terms of what makes sense in the long run. What matters to them are the profits they are making today, regardless of the impact this has on lives and our planet.\nFor them, the more green energy is deployed, the more it lowers the price. The problem as they see it is that the rise of renewables is making it more difficult for big energy companies to make the kind of profits they are accustomed to making.\nMarkets are not capable of solving major social problems, precisely because they focus on individual behaviour when collective action is needed.\nNow more than ever we need to fight to challenge and disrupt the fossil fuel industry and oppose their energy rip-off. We need an energy system that centres on human need, rather than private profit; one that can utilise the latest in renewable technology to provide an affordable and reliable supply of green energy to benefit all.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_lulas-victory-is-a-sign-of-hope-for-brazil-and-the-world-but-he-faces-a-huge-fight/content_629.html": "Lula’s Victory is a sign of hope for Brazil and the world, but he faces a huge fight\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nCLAUDIA WEBBE MP warns that although the left-wing Workers Party’s win has been recognised domestically and internationally, the deep roots of Bolsonaro’s cronies and the wealthy elite will mean a bitter battle now begins\nTHE news of Lula’s defeat of Jair Bolsonaro in the Brazil presidential election has broken through like a ray of light on the horizon, reminding us that the sun still shines despite the gloom and bringing hope, not just for the people and environment of Brazil, but for the rest of the world too.\nLula’s triumph at the polls is the world’s most significant election of 2022. On winning, Lula vowed to unify the country with a politics of peace, love and hope.\nThe election outcome is a powerful demonstration of the determination of progressive forces in Brazil to reclaim democracy against all odds. He is the first person to be democratically elected as president of Brazil three times.\nBut he faces an almighty struggle to change that country for the better, internally and externally.\nThe headline result appears narrow — less than two percentage points separating the left-wing Lula from the right-wing extremist Bolsonaro. But in an election where reports of attempts to intimidate and even physically block voters in Lula’s strongholds from reaching polling booths, the real public support for Lula’s plan to restore what was taken from ordinary people is likely to be considerably higher than the figures reflect.\nAnd how badly that change is needed. Bolsonaro’s macho refusal to react to the pandemic saw almost 700,000 Brazilians die of Covid. Offered vaccines for his people by the international community, he declined for months even to respond, only trying to shake off his image as a Covid-denier when the soaring death toll turned public opinion against him.\nBolsonaro’s oppression of indigenous people was described by Survival International as a “devastating and criminal onslaught” and a “war” against them. It enabled murders of activists trying to protect their communities and habitat, alongside intentional starvation of communities, and was classified by the International Criminal Court in the Hague as requiring investigation for “incitement to genocide and widespread systematic attacks against indigenous peoples” and saw widespread calls for him to be indicted for crimes against humanity.\nAnd that oppression and starvation was not limited to indigenous groups. A hundred million Brazilians live in dire poverty and 33m face acute hunger, while Bolsonaro focused on policies to make the rich richer and fill corporate bank accounts.\nUnder Bolsonaro, the felling of Brazilian rainforest — the “lungs of the earth” — reached its highest level since at least 2008, displacing indigenous tribes, devastating species and damaging the whole planet’s ecosystem.\nLula, by contrast, has promised to drastically cut the deforestation that became rampant under Bolsonaro’s corporate-friendly presidency and to grant protected status to half a million square kilometres of rainforest.\nThis is not just talk: in his previous two terms as Brazilian president, deforestation was cut by 70 per cent. Experts say it will fall by 90 per cent in his new term — or even be halted completely if he is allowed to enact his political plan.\nLula has also always been a supporter of the rights of indigenous tribes. That consistency saw indigenous groups wear Lula’s campaign colours in combination with their traditional clothes and headgear as a sign of their steadfast support for him.\nAgain, Lula’s track record shows that his promises to them — which include the rainforest pledge and a commitment to end the illegal mining that has devastated many communities, as well as to enshrine and uphold their human rights — are not just campaign rhetoric to be dumped as soon as power is won.\nAnd Lula has promised to make lifting people out of poverty and improving their lives his first priority. In his victory speech, he told a huge crowd of cheering supporters that in Brazil, the world’s third-biggest producer of food, “We can’t accept it as normal that in this country millions of men, women and children don’t have enough to eat… We have the duty to guarantee that every Brazilian can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.”\nLula’s political will to turn these promises into reality and the popular support for the measures he plans in order to achieve it may not be an issue, but he will have to overcome huge structural barriers to do so.\nBolsonaro has spent the past four years stacking as many of his allies, relatives and backers into Brazil’s political structures and in particular into Brazil’s congress, where most of the key positions have been filled with hard-line right wingers with deeply anti-indigenous views.\nEven if fears of an attempt to defy the election result prove unfounded — by no means a given until the hand over of power has actually been carried out — the prevalence of the far right in the congress will mean that Lula faces the political equivalent of hand-to-hand fighting for every inch of political advance he wants to make for the sake of the people.\nIn regional administrations, too, Bolsonaro’s men hold much power and will do all they can to obstruct Lula, while the corporations profiteering from oppression of communities and the destruction of the environment will not easily relinquish their power.\nAnd that resistance will not just be internal. As we’ve seen in so many cases, when a left-wing government takes office, especially in Latin America, it’s never long before the international neoliberal establishment turns the screws to try to impede it and then bring it down, while the media spins a narrative that the fall was the inevitable result of bad management and the unfitness of left-wing policies.\nBritain cannot be relied upon to be any kind of positive influence, especially after revelations that the Conservative government spent millions pushing Bolsonaro to open Brazil’s oil and gas industries to British corporate interests.\nThe sheer size and resources of Brazil are likely to have a limiting effect on the effectiveness of external pressure, but while Western governments might feel some relief that Bolsonaro’s outright fascism is no longer running Brazil and various prime ministers and premiers offer the obligatory and rote congratulations required by convention, many also cannot bring themselves to actually welcome the election of a government with left-wing politics and intent.\nEven in the hours after his victory, political leaders and media are already showing evidence of that ambivalence. Political leaders have offered congratulations, of course, but in terms of positives few have gone further than to say they are “looking forward to working with him” to achieve mutual ends, whatever those may be.\nMedia coverage has seen right-wing commentators free to talk without contradiction about Lula’s “conviction in a corruption scandal” as boding ill for his country and presidency, despite the fact that the conviction was overturned by supreme court judges as grossly political and unfounded.\nThe path forward for Brazil under Lula’s presidency will not be smoothed by Western assistance, nor even moral support of political leaders in most other countries, beyond empty words.\nIn spite of the obstacles and dangers Lula faces, his victory is a cause for hope and celebration for those around the word who see the diminishment of political hate and corporate power as essential for the future of the planet, its people and its wildlife.\nBut the international left must support Lula in what will be a pitched battle against the forces of reaction, hatred and exploitation to achieve his goals in a presidency that he has said will be his last. For the sake of Brazil and the world, it is a challenge that he simply must win.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_lloyds-confirms-latest-city-branch-closure-as-mp-fears-disproportionate-impact-on-vulnerable/content_673.html": "‘People facing 2-mile-plus trip for in-person banking’\nLocal MP Claudia Webbe has hit out at mass closures across the city\nA busy city road is set to lose its last remaining bank branch. Lloyds, in Uppingham Road, Rowlatts Hill, will shut on Thursday, November 2.\nThe branch is located in a busy shopping area of the A47, near North Evington, which used to be home to other banks. The branch’s closure will leave the next closest Lloyds branch in the city centre.\nLocal MP Claudia Webbe, who has an office a stone’s throw from the closing branch, has hit out at the decision, along with other closures that she said would disproportionately impact the most vulnerable people. She also claimed Lloyds only began to discuss the impact of the closure with locals once it had already been announced.\nA decision published on the Lloyds website says the decision was made following an “in-depth review”. The review assessed how often customers used the branch and what for, among other factors.\nMs Webbe said in a statement: “The closure of the Lloyds branch on Uppingham Road in November will leave an entire community without a bank branch and facing a journey of over two miles for in-person banking, while the bank only began discussing the impact with the community or its representatives when it had already announced the closure. At least another eight bank branches will close across Leicestershire this year, including at least two more in Leicester already closed or about to – and some parts of the city have already lost more than three-quarters of their branches.\n“This closure forms part of a mass nationwide programme of closures by high street banks that has seen branch numbers cut by almost six thousand since 2015 at a rate of over fifty a month. The loss of a bank branch has a huge and disproportionate impact on elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, who rely more on in-person banking and face the greatest difficulties in reaching more distant branches.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_dozens-of-mps-back-rmts-save-our-ticket-offices-campaign/content_589.html": "Dozens of MPs have backed RMT’s Save Our Ticket Offices campaign which will end tonight.\nLeciester East MP Claudia Webbe, who has written about the issue in the Morning Star, tabled an early day motion opposing the plans to close 974 offices in England in July.\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was among 20 Labour, SNP, independent and Green MPs who backed her motion.\nNeither Sir Keir Starmer, who has been criticised by rail unions for not backing their fight for better pay and conditions, nor any member of his shadow cabinet was among the signatories.\nShadow minister for higher education Matt Western has however backed a local campaign against the planned closures by the Rail Delivery Group, along with several Tory MPs.\nSpeaking before a public consultation on them ended tonight, he said on Twitter: “Our ticket offices are at risk of closure and it’s so important we make clear how valued they are.”\nMore than 460,000 people have responded to the proposals, and London TravelWatch and Transport Focus will assess the response to the consultation.\nTSSA interim general secretary Peter Pendle said: “It is clear from the overwhelming response to the consultation that the public will not tolerate this attack on our services.\n“The Conservatives must now listen to the voting public and shelve these reckless plans.”\nRMT general secretary Mick Lynch has called the fight to stop the closure of ticket offices at railway stations a “fight for the future of our communities” at a march and rally against the plans on Thursday night.\nAddressing the crowd, he said: “People up and down this country are sick and tired of their communities being hollowed out.\n“Everywhere we go, all the community assets are being hollowed out in the name of profit, in the name of modernisation.”\nMs Webbe told the Star: “It’s not hard to see why the government deliberately chose not to assess the impact of the plan given the huge potential for harm to vulnerable travellers that has been raised by disability groups.\n“A large majority of the public favours full renationalisation of public services, including two thirds for rail, including among Tory voters, yet their wishes continue to be ignored.”\nShe pointed out that the breakdowns of ticketing machines, apps and websites showed that there really was “no substitute for ticket office staff — real people.”\n“It’s sadly very clear that this government favours the profits of its corporate donors above the wellbeing of ordinary people — and they and the rail delivery operators have shown themselves ready to mislead on the consequences of this plan,” Ms Webbe added.\n“Rail companies are paying out huge dividends despite enormous public subsidies, while failing operators get bailed out with more public funds. All this is money that would be reinvested in services if rail was renationalised as it should be and as the public wants. It’s time for the needs of the people to come first for once.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_reckless-tory-government-not-taking-safety-seriously/content_696.html": "‘Reckless Tory government’ not taking safety seriously\nLabour calls for audit of all public-sector buildings after schools forced to close over collapse-risk concrete\nLABOUR called for an urgent audit of all public-sector buildings containing concrete at risk of sudden collapse today as teaching unions demanded that the government covers the related costs for schools.\nThe party’s deputy leader Angela Rayer accused the Tories of sitting on their hands before telling 104 schools and colleges containing the material they must close classrooms days before the school year begins.\nMs Rayner said: “The safety of the public is not being taken seriously by this reckless Tory government. If public safety is at risk, we need to know urgently.\n“The government sat on their hands for years and then shut schools the week before term starts. We cannot let them lurch from crisis to crisis.\n“The public needs to know how much damage the Tories have done to our schools, prisons, hospitals and job centres over the past 13 years of incompetent government.\n“An urgent, full audit is required to find out the extent that Conservative ministers failed to replace this dangerous concrete across the public sector estate,” she concluded.\nNEU general secretary Daniel Kebede criticised schools minister Nick Gibb for blaming schools for a Department for Education U-turn over what costs schools would have to cover due to concerns over the presence of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac).\nGuidance issued to schools on Thursday night said rental costs for emergency or temporary accomodation for education settings or additional transport costs would not be covered by government — however Mr Gibb, who this morning said more schools could be asked to close buildings than the 104 contacted so far, reversed this decision.\nMr Kebede welcomed the “U-turn on costs that could well have been almost impossible for already beleaguered schools, given the lack of school funding and budgets already stretched to the limit.\n“Nick Gibb must now be absolutely clear on what costs will or will not be taken on by government. The current guidance should not be left to interpretation. No costs should come out of existing school budgets, and it must be funded from government.”\nHe blamed the Tories for “never adequately” replacing the £55-billion Building Schools for the Future funding programme axed in 2010, adding: “The NEU and sister unions have been raising concerns ever since and pressuring Education Secretary Gillian Keegan in recent months to release a list of Raac-affected schools.”\nNASUWT general secretary Dr Patrick Roach said: “It would appear that mere luck rather than judgement has prevented a major disaster. Today’s announcement highlights the impact of more than a decade of wilful underinvestment in school building refurbishment and the renewal of our school estate.”\nOn Thursday, the DfE said it had contacted 104 schools after just 52 of the 156 containing the concrete took protective steps so far this year.\nMr Gibb insisted: “We took the decision as soon as the evidence emerged.”\nBoth the NEU and Labour have demanded that the government name all the affected schools.\nThe DfE has been considering Raac — a lightweight building material used from the 1950s up to the mid-1990s — a potential issue since late 2018.\nThe possible presence of the concrete was being assessed in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, where education is devolved.\nThe Welsh government said councils and colleges have not reported any presence of Raac.\nLeicester East MP Claudia Webbe told the Morning Star: “This danger has been known about for almost 30 years and a topic for supposedly urgent action since the collapse of a building at Singlewell primary school in Kent in 2018.\n“But as we have seen in the case of flammable cladding [in the case of the Grenfell Tower fire], the government has been slow to act, putting cost ahead of people’s safety.”\nFormer Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad said: “It was Michael Gove as education secretary in 2010 who scrapped Labour’s £55bn Building Schools for the Future programme.\n“There was no survey to follow of the structural integrity of the numerous buildings — schools but also hospitals — built with Raac with a life expectancy of 30-40 years.\n“It is a miracle that no lives have been lost to his and the Tory government’s disdainful and ignorant neglect. Will Labour do any better?”\nA Justice4Grenfell spokeswoman said: “In the face of mounting evidence and expert warnings, it is deeply disheartening to witness government inaction that puts the lives of countless children at risk.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_i-will-fight-to-oppose-those-who-try-to-divide-our-communities/content_468.html": "‘I will fight to oppose those who try to divide our communities’\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nLeicester is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the UK, and each of our interlinked communities contribute significantly to our collective religious, cultural and political life.\nI am incredibly proud of the multiculturalism and diversity of my home city. As your new Member of Parliament for Leicester East, I will be a friend and ally to all communities in our wonderful city.\nOur city’s identity is forged from a proud history of immigration, with Jewish Russian migrants arriving in the mid-1800s and European Jews fleeing persecution in the 1930s.\nAfter the Second World War, Leicester welcomed migrants from the Caribbean and the Indian sub-continent. In the late 1960s, Asian refugees arrived from East Africa, and this century we have welcomed refugees and asylum seekers from all over the world.\nThat’s why last week, like many of my constituents and people across the country, I was appalled by the government’s decision to deport dozens of people to Jamaica despite widespread protests from human rights organisations.\nThis deportation shows that the government has not learned the lessons of the Windrush scandal, in which British citizens of Caribbean descent, were wrongly detained, denied legal rights and threatened with deportation.\nThese included Rolston Knight, a Leicester resident for more than fifty years who was refused status as a British national.\nLabour is calling on the government to suspend all similar deportation flights pending the publication of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review and the implementation of its recommendations.\nLeaks from the review clearly said that it failed to take account of racial discrimination when implementing the hostile environment, and that the government shouldn’t deport people who arrived in this country under the age of 13. The Government’s flagrant disregard of its own advice is shameful, and this report must no longer be suppressed.\nIt is disputed that last week’s deportees were all foreign nationals, and many of them were convicted of non-violent offences.\nThirteen of them came to the UK as children – nine were under the age of ten, eleven had Indefinite Leave to Remain status, and one had a British passport. One came to this country at the age of five and was the victim of county lines grooming and compelled to carry drugs.\nThat person was released five years ago, and never re-offended.\nI completely oppose the deportation of British citizens.\nOn February 10, the day before the government’s planned Jamaican deportation flight, I used my contribution in parliament to ask if any of the people scheduled for deportation had been able to have access to legal advice and representation.\nThe importance of this particular issue I raised was then confirmed shortly afterwards by the Court of Appeal’s ruling that the deportations of least 25 people should be suspended until they are given their constitutional right to access justice.\nIt is totally unacceptable that those being held at detention centres at Heathrow were not able to access appropriate legal advice due to mobile signal problems that the Home Office did nothing to fix for 23 days.\nBefore any charter flight takes off, it is crucial that evidence is provided that all reasonable avenues have been explored to establish the deportees’ legal status.\nLegal aid, which has suffered excessive cuts under the Tories, is not automatically available, meaning it is very difficult for people to secure legal advice before they are deported.\nDeportations have an immense human cost.\nI have been campaigning for years to highlight the abuses suffered in detention centres, especially for women held in the notorious Yarl’s Wood centre.\nExclusive, horrific and explosive footage was released on the February 11, which I have seen in full, which leaves me in no doubt that detention centres like Yarl’s Wood are inhumane and ought to be shut down.\nWe also know that vulnerable individuals with serious medical conditions are forced to fly. One of the people deported last week, a 34-year-old father of two who left Jamaica when he was 12, was made to leave without his medication.\nThere is also often a real risk of serious harm, even death, in the countries that people are sent to.\nIn a statement, the government said that “We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove immigration offenders and dangerous foreign criminals.”despite the fact many were not dangerous criminals and have lived most of their life in Britain.\nAs a black woman representing an incredibly diverse constituency, it worries me that the Government are following Donald Trump’s playbook by generalising BAME people as criminals.\nBy stoking the flames of division, this government are shamefully trying to distract from the fact that they only govern in the interest of the super-rich.\nAt a time when hate crime has more than doubled since 2013, it has never been more important for communities to come together and unite. The government will not end the Windrush scandal unless it completely changes course.\nThat means repealing the 2014 Immigration Act and ending the ‘hostile environment’.\nWe must oppose any attempt to divide our communities based on nationality or religion.\nAs Leicester East’s new MP, I will work hard to protect all my constituents and fight against those who wish to pit communities against each other.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_a-scandal-of-our-time/content_283.html": "A Scandal of our times\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe disregard for the human rights of Jagtar Singh Johal is mirrored by the British government’s contempt for rights and lives in this country, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nThe situation of Jagtar Singh Johal, a British citizen, and the British state’s involvement in his imprisonment and torture is one of the great scandals of our time, but one that is receiving scant attention from the government and the British media.\nHis detention in India in 2017 has been condemned by the United Nations for its arbitrary nature, apparently simply for being a Sikh who campaigned for religious freedom and for human rights.\nThe authorities had years to try to dig up evidence against him but took until last year to bring what appear to be charges based on nothing more than hearsay — and a tip-off from the British security and intelligence services.\nThe UN described Jagtar’s arrest as “arbitrary” and said he should be released immediately — and even now, years later and with his trial supposedly about to take place, his lawyers told the BBC last autumn that they had still not been told what supposed evidence the authorities think links him to any crime.\nThere was all too brief a scandal in Britain after the Times revealed last summer that Britain’s security and intelligence services were involved in the arrest of this peace-loving human rights activist — an arrest that was followed by brutal torture to force him to sign blank pieces of paper that were subsequently filled in by the authorities as a supposed “confession.”\nThe Indian government, unsurprisingly, denied the torture — but the events were confirmed, though initially anonymised, in an official report by Britain’s Investigatory Powers Commissioner, which also confirmed the involvement of both MI5 and MI6 in his arrest.\nBritain is bound by the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights not to surrender its citizens for torture — neither convention allows any exception.\nYet despite the obvious concerns about the whole process, the British government appears to have taken no action and minimal interest in his case, beyond Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, saying that he “raised” the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a visit to India.\nThat’s it. It doesn’t even qualify as hand-wringing.\nAfter his arrest and torture, Jaggi — as his family and supporters call him — was held in prison for five years without charge and his case has understandably been compared to that of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, both in its injustice and in the dithering and ineffectiveness of the Foreign Office, in spite of the obvious obligation to put right a situation directly caused by the British security and intelligence services.\nBut that comparison falls short. Jaggi wasn’t imprisoned because of the loose talk and incompetence of a foreign secretary — instead the British state played a direct and entirely intentional role in what has been done to him.\nAnd then last year, after years of investigation had come up with nothing against him, Jaggi was arbitrarily charged with conspiracy to murder and terrorism — but despite his trial supposedly being set for November, there has still been no start to proceedings.\nYet there has been little meaningful coverage of his situation, let alone scrutiny and calls for action over Britain’s role in his detention, torture and abuse.\nIn December, Jaggi’s brother Gurpreet had to write an opinion piece demanding to know why the British government won’t do anything, to try to build some awareness and pressure.\nThat article noted that the government is systemically failing Britons detained abroad — and pointed out that the British government was aware from the earliest days that Jaggi was being tortured, yet five foreign secretaries and four prime ministers have done… nothing.\nIn fact, the British government is doing worse than nothing. To adapt Tony Benn’s well-known saying, you can tell how this country’s government would like to treat its citizens here by how it allows them to be treated elsewhere.\nThe government is said to be preparing to make it illegal to say anything positive about asylum-seekers arriving here in desperation by boat.\nThe tragically famous image of Alan Kurdi, the little boy whose body washed up on a beach after he drowned while trying to flee war in Syria, stirred international empathy toward the millions who are driven to desperate measures by conflict and famine — yet if Suella Braverman gets her way, it would be a crime to publish it now for that very reason.\nAnd as we saw last week, the Tories are not satisfied with their new law to criminalise protests for being “inconvenient” and imprison protesters for as much as 10 years.\nThey now plan to give police power to clamp down on protests on the grounds that they might become an inconvenience — and to stop, search, detain and ban anyone they think might be associated with a protest that hasn’t even started yet.\nThe government’s refusal to act to help Jagtar Singh Johal and others is a horrific abdication, for the sake of trade and profit, of its primary duty to protect British citizens, including those abroad — all the more so when the British state has played a direct role in the harm done to them.\nBut that attitude is mirrored in the government’s behaviour toward British citizens at home as well — which is just as driven by profit.\nAnd just as the British state played an active role in the targeting, arrest and ultimately the torture of Jagtar, it is the key actor in the assault already well under way on our rights, freedoms and living standards here.\nThe political class’s contempt for wellbeing and indifference to injustice that lies at the heart of what is being done to Jaggi and others is the same foundation for the mass attack on our freedoms in this country: to protest; to strike; to resist when government exceeds its bounds; to live free from hunger and fear and to build a decent life for ourselves and our children.\nInaction has never been good enough. Silence is not good enough. And that doesn’t just apply to government and the media, but to all of us.\nWe are faced with a political class that is willing both to ignore the abuse and imprisonment of our people in countries where human rights are regarded cheaply if at all — and to weaken and undermine our rights and freedoms here — the only sane and acceptable response is to resist and to demand better until we have it.\nWe need to meet media silence with noise. We need to meet inaction with action. And we need to meet contempt for and attacks on our humanity and our rights with an absolute, intransigent No: in the political sphere, in the workplace and where necessary in the streets.\nBritish governments often refer to their most important duty as being that of protecting British citizens. It’s time for that to be seen in action, not just talk.\nFor the sake of Jagtar Singh Johal and for ourselves we must settle for nothing less than immediate and decisive action from the government.\nWhether that’s on behalf of Jagtar and every other wrongly detained British citizen abroad, or in the abandonment of the Establishment’s attacks on us and the rebuilding of what’s been vandalised and destroyed by those in power, it has to be now.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

The 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — seen by scientists as a tipping point past which climate disasters will be locked in — then oil and gas production has to fall by 20 per cent by 2030.\nI am gravely concerned that, if the fossil fuel companies are left to their own devices, crucial targets such as these will be missed.\nTo give one example, ExxonMobil is internally projected to extract 25 per cent more oil and gas in 2025 than in 2017.\nOil companies like Exxon and Shell knew that their extractive industries were causing climate change in the 1980s, but instead of informing the public they funded climate change denial and lobbied against environmental policies.\nA 2017 study in the scientific publication World Development found that worldwide fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $4.9 trillion in 2013.\nIt estimated that eliminating those subsidies would have cut global carbon emissions by 21 per cent and air pollution deaths by over half.\nIt is vital that these subsidies are ended, and that government bailouts are subject to stringent commitments to workers’ rights, tax justice and rapid decarbonisation.\nWithout immediate government intervention, the urgent action required to preserve a habitable planet will be too slow.\nThis will cause unimaginable disruption and could cost millions of lives, most immediately and sharply in the Global South — countries which have contributed the least to climate change.\nThe current crisis has demonstrated that we are only as secure as the most precarious among us.\nIt has revealed the power of the state to transform industries, provide a safety net and tackle injustices.\nIt has shown that profound social and economic change really is possible.\nThe lockdown and its consequences have changed many people’s way of working and opened up the possibility of work and society being organised differently.\nInvesting in the local and creating streets for people and the habitat must be high on our agenda.\nAt this unprecedented moment, the government must consider all possible interventions and regulations, including nationalisation, to phase out the extraction of fossil fuels and transition to renewables as soon as scientifically possible.\nIt must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs, not ordinary people.\nThis will require an unprecedented effort, and it is vital that the protection of all workers and communities is guaranteed during the transition to renewable energies.\nThe concurrent mass creation of well-paid, unionised jobs would be vital in the mass re-employment which will be required after the coronavirus crisis.\nIt is crucial that the government seizes the once-in-a-generation opportunity presented by the need to rebuild in the aftermath of the pandemic to rapidly decarbonise our economy through a green recovery.\nWe need that plan now so that we can invest in the green industries of the future, put people back to work in good, green jobs across the country and support workers and communities as we make the transition to a low-carbon and socially just economy.\nUltimately, as we rebuild, we must bail out workers and the planet — not big polluters.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

It’s completely wrong that it has to bear the brunt of climate change.\nOn the other hand, the UK government announced providing urgent life-saving support of £15 million to Pakistan following devastating floods that have left a third of the country underwater.\nThe flooding in Pakistan has affected more than 33 million people, with 1,100 lives lost. The latest funding announced by the Foreign Secretary comes after the UK provided £1.5 million to the disaster last weekend.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_rebecca-long-bailey-can-take-the-fight-to-the-tories-and-win-for-labour/content_345.html": "Rebecca Long Bailey can take the fight to the Tories and win for Labour\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\n”Rebecca Long Bailey is the leader who can best ensure Labour is both a strong effective opposition to the Tories and has a path to power”\nIn recent years, Labour has become a firmly anti-austerity party committed to putting people and planet before private profit.\nI believe that going forward — to rebuild Labour and to win the next election — we need to remain committed to not only opposing austerity, but also to further developing a radical “investment not cuts” agenda.\nTo me, this is the key issue in the current Labour leadership election and why I’m backing Rebecca Long Bailey, who has again and again showed she can walk the walk as well as talk the talk when it comes to fighting the Tories on this ground.\nReturning to “austerity-lite” policies would not only hinder us in effectively challenging the Tories and their reactionary, divisive agenda but also lead to us losing more support.\nIn fact, policies such as a radical green new deal, scrapping universal credit, and extending public ownership are popular with both Labour members and the public, and should be maintained and developed.\nWe will not win by rolling back on this transformative agenda. Instead we must develop and popularise it — showing how real change is possible and that we can transform the lives of the majority for the better.\nTake, for example, an issue which has been highlighted in the Labour leadership race itself — namely, whether we should continue to support public ownership of key services and utilities.\nPublic opinion on this matter is as follows.\nFor Royal Mail public ownership is supported by 69 per cent of the public. Railways by 64 per cent. Water companies by 63 per cent. And when it comes to bus companies, by 55 per cent.\nSo despite what some in the Tory-supporting parts of the media say, Labour’s public ownership policies were not unpopular or what lost the election.\nIn fact, their popularity shows they can be a vote-winner for Labour.\nPublic ownership is also essential to the strategic, sustained investment we need in our economy, including for the genuine industrial strategy that all our nations and regions so desperately need.\nAs a key architect of our Green New Deal and industrial strategy, Rebecca knows that we can’t protect our planet, and improve the living standards of the majority, without these core planks of our economic alternative.\nLabour members mustn’t let anyone tell us that abandoning our opposition to austerity — or abandoning support for an “investment not cuts” agenda including through extending public ownership — will win us more support.\nIndeed, every one of our sister parties in Europe that has embraced austerity and cuts have seen support fall to unprecedented levels.\nThat doesn’t of course mean that we mustn’t learn the lessons from our general election defeat and recognise how devastating that defeat is for millions of people across Britain who need an end to Tory rule.\nBut it does mean we need to learn the right lessons, and not throw the baby out with the bathwater.\nMoving forward, as Long Bailey has said, “we must rebuild trust, not only in our party but in the idea that change really is possible. This means we cannot return to the politics of the past.\n“Our transformative agenda is principled and popular, while triangulation and soft pedalling will only take us backwards.”\nLinked to this, I also think that what Long Bailey is saying in terms of how we mustn’t wait until the next general election to change people’s lives for the better is vital.\nNot only must we win Labour mayors and Labour councillors this year, we must also continue organising in communities now, strengthening Labour’s support across all the nations and regions.\nWith Boris Johnson governing on such a reactionary agenda, it is vital that we resist the Tories every step of the way, including by not compromising our anti-racist and internationalist principles.\nYes, we need to lead the resistance to the Tories in Parliament and in the council chamber.\nBut we also need to also do this by supporting trade unions in our workplaces and standing by communities, migrants and all those under attack from the Tories.\nThat’s why I was pleased to see Long Bailey commit to supporting workers in dispute and say that we will be on the picket line as well as in Parliament.\nWe must also protest on the streets against their reactionary policies, whether that be against the Tories supporting Donald Trump’s warmongering abroad or against their inhumane deportation flights, or against their insistence on carrying on with dehumanising universal credit here.\nWe must also give full support to all those young people and others who will continue to engage in direct action to highlight the need to tackle the climate emergency in the months ahead, while also building support for our Green New Deal and socialist solutions to climate chaos.\nThe fightback is starting against the Tories. Now we must organise in every community — and on every day of the year — building trust in the idea that we can change Britain for the better, empowering people and communities.\nWith these factors in mind, I believe Long Bailey is the leader who can best ensure Labour is both a strong, effective opposition to the Tories and has a path to power.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_this-government-have-normalised-hunger-poverty-hopelessness-claudia-webbe-mp/content_775.html": "The Government have normalised hunger, poverty & hopelessness\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe are pleased to reproduce below Claudia Webbe MP’s maiden speech:\nFirst, I want to express my deep gratitude to the people of Leicester East for electing me to this place. It is truly an honour to represent the city where I was born and where I grew up—the city my parents made their home. Leicester, of course, is full of surprises. I mean, who would have imagined that it would become home to the most famous car park in the world, where the remains of King Richard III were found, and who would have imagined that Leicester City football club, ranked 5,000-1 outsiders, would be crowned premier league champions in 2016\nLeicester is bursting with talent and inventiveness. We have the National Space Centre on the edge of my constituency, vibrant theatres and concert halls, and our world-famous Diwali festival on the Golden Mile. Leicester’s Attenborough arts centre is one of only five in the country to be purpose-built for disabled artists and audiences. You know, in any fish and chip shop across the country, you will find no better pie than Leicester’s Pukka Pie. There is no better cheese than Red Leicester, no better packet of crisps than Walkers and no better vegetarian curry house than in my constituency of Leicester East.\nI would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Keith Vaz, the longest-serving British Asian MP, who represented Leicester East for 32 years. The 1987 election, when Keith Vaz was elected, was a watershed moment in the history of race relations in this country. There had been no black MPs for over half a century. Keith Vaz became only the third British Asian ever elected to this Parliament. That election also brought to this House pioneering black MPs Paul Boateng, Bernie Grant and—my inspiration—my right hon. Friend the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), the first black woman ever elected to Parliament. I am proud to be part of the Parliament with the highest number of African, Asian and minority ethnic MPs ever. Over his long parliamentary career, Keith Vaz advanced the cause of representation and race equality while also holding major positions, including Minister for Europe and, famously, Chair of the Home Affairs Committee. Keith is of course a passionate campaigner on the issue of diabetes. He also did truly important work in highlighting the UK’s involvement in what he rightly called the “forgotten war” in Yemen. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will join me in wishing Keith Vaz and his family well in his retirement from this House.\nAs a feminist, it is a privilege to be addressing this House as the first female Member of Parliament for Leicester East. I am also proud to be the first British-born Member of Parliament of African descent from the beautiful Caribbean island of Nevis. My parents came from Nevis to the UK and, remarkably, given a Nevisian population of just 11,000, they met for the first time here. They settled in Leicester, where I was born, so Leicester of course runs through my veins.\nI am a daughter of the Windrush generation, and we must never forget the history of struggle of African, Caribbean and Asian people in this so-called United Kingdom, without whose blood, sweat, toil and tears there simply would be no kingdom and no form of modern prosperity. I have no doubt that my ancestors are here with me today. And I share the pain of their suffering because of the historical injustice of slavery and colonialism, but I also share their joy at the liberation that brings me to this place today. Throughout the centuries my foremothers argued for and suffered and died for the freedoms I enjoy here today in this place. With my presence in this House, Commonwealth history and the British empire cannot hide.\nWe cannot talk about the present without recognition, apology, returning what was stolen and reparations for the past. One fifth of the billionaires in Britain owe their wealth to the transportation of my ancestors, because they benefited from the compensation of the equivalent of £20 billion in today’s value for the “human property” they somehow lost at sea. It is to our shame that Members of this House during the mid to late 1700s represented slave plantations, and let us not forget that British colonialism reduced India from holding 23% of the world economy to 4% by the time the British left.\nHow many in this House know or care about the British torture camps in 1950s Kenya, where members of the Kikuyu tribe were systematically tortured, starved, beaten, mistreated and raped? How many in this House know or care about the massacre committed by British colonial groups in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar massacre? And let us not forget that working people here from all over the Commonwealth died in their thousands in both world wars, only to see their descendants shackled and deported in the continued shame that is the hostile environment.\nMy father, along with his his identical twin brother, worked as an engineer’s hand at the former Wadkin factory on Green Lane in what is now my constituency of Leicester East, but those unionised factories, jobs and industries of the past were destroyed, along with Leicester’s manufacturing base, by Thatcherism in the pursuit of free-market capitalism.\nLeicester is considered the home to the garment industry. My mother was a home-worker, skilled as a dressmaker, a seamstress and an overlocker. But in Leicester’s garment industry today many workers, overwhelmingly women, earn well below the minimum wage—as little as £3 an hour in conditions that most people would find unthinkable in modern Britain.\nThat is the legacy of Tory deindustrialisation, yet Leicester is the place where working women fought back. It was Asian women who went on strike for equal pay at Leicester’s Imperial Typewriter Company factory, and it was those women who led the way in equal pay, race equality, and employment. I pay tribute to them.\nI am incredibly proud that Leicester is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the UK. Our city’s identity is forged from a proud history of immigration from the Commonwealth and beyond. Over two thirds—68%—of my constituents are from an African, Asian or minority ethnic background, and nearly half of our residents were born outside the UK. We are home to 240 faith groups across 14 different faiths and our residents hail from 50 countries across the globe.\nThis is what makes Leicester East so special. We are the city where the minorities make up the majority, and we are richer for this vibrant exchange of cultures. But racism and the far right have left an indelible stain on the history of my constituency. Enoch Powell’s racist “rivers of blood” speech in 1968 gave rise to the National Front and its message of hatred and intolerance across my constituency, but the history of Leicester’s anti-racist activists, campaigners and organisers who fought back against the rise of organised racism is a source of great pride and inspiration. In April 1979, when the National Front organised a 1,000-strong rally in Leicester starting at Welford Road recreation ground, they were confronted by 2,000 anti-racist protestors who withstood police violence to send the message out loud and clear that racism shall not pass through Leicester. It was a turning point in the decline of the National Front. We even renamed Welford Road recreation ground: fittingly, we renamed it Nelson Mandela Park.\nThe right for different communities and cultures, and for people of all faiths and none, to live side by side has been won through generations of struggle. I do not take our unity and solidarity for granted. This Government, a Government for the super-rich, the oligarchs the tax dodgers, are still trying to divide our communities based on the colour of our skin, our religion or where we come from. I know only too well the hurt that my constituents feel when the Government legitimise the dehumanisation and marginalisation of African, Caribbean, Asian and minority ethnic communities by deporting our people and embracing institutionalised racism, as was revealed by the Windrush scandal and the hostile environment. The continued detentions, deportations and charter flights are simply barbaric.\nIn communities like mine, this Government have normalised hunger, poverty and hopelessness. It should be a national disgrace in the sixth richest country in the world for a single person to be without food, and for just one parent to have to choose between heating their home and feeding their children. Yet more and more families in my constituency are relying on food banks every year, and fuel poverty is growing. Nearly 40% of children in Leicester East are growing up in poverty. As the 1% increase their share of the national wealth, our regions are pulled further and further apart in terms of income inequality and life chances.\nLeicester was recently shown to be one of the most polluted cities in the UK. I vow to fight for clean air. I vow to fight for clean energy and climate justice, so that my constituents and people across the world, particularly the global south, can have a liveable future. It is vital that those responsible for climate chaos, the fossil fuel companies and big polluters, are not allowed to profit from climate breakdown, and instead pay their fair share so that future generations can inherit a habitable planet.\nI am proud of my party. I am proud of the leadership of my right hon. Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) in opposing austerity, opposing corporate power, tackling inequality and the climate emergency, and for having rewritten the terms of political debate.\nMadam Deputy Speaker, I stand before you today in the lineage of people who fought to keep our culture and traditions alive, and to keep the shackles off our feet. I come from a people who survived: survived the evils of slavery. Today, and every day, I am grateful that they never gave up. I vow that as Leicester East’s new Member of Parliament, I too will never give up. I will work hard to protect all my constituents and fight against those who wish to pit our communities against each another.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_mercy-bagumas-tragic-death-should-mark-a-turning-point-for-the-home-office/content_195.html": "The fate of an asylum seeker shows the inhumanity of our migration system\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nMercy Baguma’s tragic death should mark a turning point for the Home Office\nOne would have thought that in the sixth richest country in the world, malnourishment and hunger would be a thing of the past. Yet this week Mercy Baguma, an asylum seeker from Uganda who was living in “extreme poverty”, was found dead next to her malnourished baby in a Glasgow flat. Baguma’s body was only found because of the cries of her child.\nThis unspeakable, avoidable tragedy is indicative of the inhumanity that is embedded in our immigration system. Frankly, deaths such as these are a stain on our collective soul. While billionaires and big corporations record ever-increasing profits, it is shameful that our people are dying of hunger.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused widespread suffering for too many individuals and communities across the UK. We have the worst of both worlds: in addition to England having the highest number of excess deaths, we are facing our worst ever recession, which is nearly twice the severity of comparable European nations.\nWhile the government’s financial support for businesses and employees has been far from perfect, many of those affected have at least been able to claim some modicum of support to cope with this crisis. Yet this opportunity has not been afforded to some of the most vulnerable people in the UK.\nThousands of UK residents who are undocumented, and those who have no recourse to public funds (NRPF), have already been driven into destitutionduring this crisis. Recent Home Office statistics show that the number of migrants with NRPF who have applied for destitution funds has increased dramatically, by 572% in the months spanning the coronavirus crisis.\nThis means that nearly 3,000 migrants facing total hardship could be waiting to hear if they and their families will be able to avoid severe poverty. This includes only the limited number of migrants who are aware of the destitution provision – given the “hostile environment” for migrants, many do not know that they are eligible for any state support.\nThe statistics also revealed that it took the Home Office an average of 30 days to decide on these life-or-death applications. In order to speed up the process and enable families to access emergency support, I have written to the home secretary to urge the Home Office to commit to making these decisions within 24 hours.\nIt is also appalling that the Home Office does not even record the number of UK residents with NRPF. This is despite a recent intervention from the Office for Statistics Regulation, which expressed alarm at the Home Office’s repeated refusal to do so. It is contrary to reason to develop policy without knowing how many the condition affects – the government must adopt this most basic of tasks.\nThe furlough and self-employment schemes are also largely inaccessible to those with NRPF, who are often on informal or zero-hour contracts, and these schemes do not provide any support to those who have seen their contracts terminated or hours reduced. Many will already have been in debt before the crisis, owing to the exorbitant visa renewal fees and surcharges, which must be paid every two and a half years.\nMy constituency of Leicester East is home to many workers with NRPF, for whom it is impossible to survive without attending work – often in unsafe conditions. A significant number of workers in Leicester’s crisis-struck garment industry who have approached me for help have the NRPF condition, are unaware of the small number of benefits that they are able to access, and are employed by unscrupulous firms that have no union recognition and where health and safety measures have not been implemented.\nThe government’s justification for this cruel policy is that it is “protecting public funds” by preventing vulnerable migrants from accessing basic benefits. Yet they do not exhibit this same frugality when handing out wasteful, multimillion-pound contracts to private companies, or enabling billionaires and large corporations to evade tax.\nThe tragic irony is that many people with NRPF, who are living in constant fear of the British state, work in frontline services that the government has been at pains to praise during this crisis. The pandemic has shown that the people who really keep our society ticking are not billionaires and the super-rich, but nurses, carers, cleaners, checkout attendants and many more essential frontline workers. We must ensure that all frontline workers are valued and protected as we rebuild our economy and society.\nIt is vital that we repay this extraordinary contribution with a permanent extension of migrant rights. That means an end to the hostile environment, shutting detention centres and granting indefinite leave to everyone living in the UK.\nIt also means that the government must ensure that all migrants have automatic access to resources without fear of detention or deportation by permanently abolishing the NRPF provision. Mercy Baguma’s death must be a turning point. In a country of extreme inequality and abundant wealth, we simply cannot allow any of our residents to starve.",

We charge you with genocide,” referring to the prime minister.\nMany speakers at the rally stressed the need for an immediate cease-fire, citing the plight of civilians, especially starving children.\nAmong them was Jenny Leong, a lawmaker from Australia’s Green Party, who brought a message of solidarity and support from the tens of thousands of people who have been taking to the streets of Sydney every weekend since October.\nCriticizing the insufficient response from the international community in the face of the Israeli attacks, she said that what is occurring now in Gaza is “genocidal attempts.”\nShe also denounced the Australian government’s support for Israel and called for a cease-fire.\nClaudia Webbe, a British member of parliament for Leicester East, said those who were attending the protest were standing on the right side of history.\nAlso defining the situation in Gaza as a “genocide,” she stressed that Israel is using starvation as a “weapon of war.”\n“Political leaders are not listening,” noted Webbe, citing surveys indicating that over 80% of the British public wants the killing of Palestinians to stop\n“We know that none of us are free until Palestine is free,” she added.\nIsrael launched its war on Gaza after a Oct. 7 cross-border incursion by the Palestinian group Hamas. It has since killed more than 31,300 Palestinians and pushed the territory to the brink of famine.\nIsrael has also imposed a crippling blockade on the Palestinian enclave, leaving its population, particularly residents of northern Gaza, on the verge of starvation.\nThe war has pushed 85% of Gaza’s population into internal displacement amid acute shortages of food, clean water, and medicine, while most of the enclave’s infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN.\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which in an interim ruling in January ordered Tel Aviv to stop genocidal acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

The event was to celebrate Vaisakhi and saw Leicester’s Sikh community make the journey between two of the city’s main Gurdwaras, from Holy Bones near St Nicholas Circle up to East Park Road in Highfields.\nThe procession sees all parts of the Sikh community involved, including the area’s Sikh motorcycle club, performances of Gatka – a Sikh martial art – as well as thousands of people travelling on foot, via buses, and following vans reciting hymns and songs. Some 10,000 people were expected to get involved in Sunday’s Nagar Kirtan, with the centre of Leicester being brought to a standstill to allow the procession.\nThere was also plenty of food being given out too, which is part of the Sikh belief of selfless service, fighting hunger, showing equality in action, and teaching compassion. All visitors, regardless of race, religion, or social status, were offered food and drink on the warm Sunday afternoon, with people from all backgrounds getting involved and enjoying the celebration.\nREAD MORE: Plans for creating new Leicestershire village take next step\nSome of the local MPs also got involved in the celebration, with South Leicester MP Jonathan Ashworth tweeting: “Brilliant atmosphere here at the St Peters Road section of Leicester’s Nagar Kirtan. Thank you to friends from Clarendon Park Gurdwara for the delicious chabeel as well!”\nLeicester West MP Liz Kendall wrote: “Incredible turnout for Nagar Kirtan today, starting at Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Leicester West. Lovely to see so many friends too.”\nLeicester East MP Claudia Webbe wrote: “Leicester’s Nagar Kirtan in celebration of Vaisakhi was outstanding today.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_its-time-for-international-solidarity-with-minneapolis/content_476.html": "It's Time for International\nSolidarity with Minneapolis\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nIt’s time for International Solidarity with Minneapolis\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nSocialists in Britain should support those protesting the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis – and campaign against the racism the plaques our own police forces, argues Claudia Webbe.\nIt is a grim testament to the inescapable nature of institutional racism that viral videos of unarmed African Americans being killed by white police officers have become tragically commonplace. Yet even within this depraved normality, the video of George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police has understandably provoked a wave of revulsion, anger and revolt amongst African, Asian and minority ethnic communities across the world.\nThe footage shows Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police department who had 18 prior complaints filed against him including two previous shootings, kneeling on George Floyd’s neck for nine minutes as he pleaded for his life. Floyd was handcuffed, and clearly posed no threat. His crime? Allegedly, cashing a bad cheque for the value of $20.\n“I can’t breathe.” George Floyd’s chilling last words have become a slogan of the civil uprising which has followed his murder. What makes this even more tragic, is that these exact words were the last spoken by Eric Garner, another unarmed African-American murdered by the police after being accused of selling unlicensed cigarettes.\nThe petty nature of these alleged wrongdoings bare examining. While gun-toting white supremacist terrorists such as Dylan Roof and Patrick Crusius are peacefully arrested after their racially-motivated murderous rampages, unarmed African Americans are murdered by supposed protectors of the peace for the most minor infringements.\nTo add to the injustice, police officers that kill civilians are often simply fired (at most, many remain on the force) and do not face the criminal charges which would await any other member of our society. Chauvin and his accomplices have so far been sacked by Minneapolis police, but it remains to be seen if a thorough murder investigation will occur.\nCampaign Zero, a social justice organisation that maps police violence across the US, found that Minneapolis police kill black residents at a rate more than 13 times higher that of white people. A 2019 study found that 1 in 1,000 Black American men and boys can expect to die as a result of police violence over the course of their lives – a risk that is 2.5 times higher than their white peers, and which puts police use of force in the top ten causes of death for black men in their mid to late twenties.\nUnsurprisingly, President Donald Trump – who has a long history of racist comments – weighed in with incendiary remarks that have rightly been concealed on Twitter for glorifying violence. The President warned protestors in Minneapolis that he would send the military to intervene if there was “any difficulty.” “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump wrote, apparently quoting former Miami police chief Walter Headley, who in December 1967 promised violent reprisals on Black protestors.\nSadly, this comes as no surprise. This is a President who hires white supremacists and praises armed, predominantly white right-wing protests against coronavirus safety-measures, yet gleefully condemns the social outpouring of anger and grief against racist police brutality. The UK government must condemn him if they are serious about standing up to racism of all kinds, wherever it appears in the world.\nMany people from across the political divide have sought to disregard the uprising in Minneapolis as unprovoked rioting. Yet this does not recognise the fact that America has been built on the slavery, dispossession and subjugation of its African American population. It is crucial to understand the Minneapolis uprising in the context of the centuries of social deprivation and economic extraction that have been endured by African Americans.\nWe must stand in solidarity with the family, friends and community of George Floyd in Minneapolis. We in the UK cannot ignore yet another death of an unarmed Black man in police custody.\nIt is also crucial that we in the UK do not assume we are immune from the disease of institutional racism. African, Asian and minority ethnic communities disproportionately suffer from police use of force in the UK, are over-represented in the prison population and are more likely to be sent to prison than white offenders.\nAccording to Inquest, there have been 1,741 deaths following contact with the police in England and Wales since 1990 – with African, Asian and minority ethnic communities disproportionately impacted. The Runnymede Trust found that, between 1995 and 2015, not a single police officer was ever prosecuted over a Black death in custody. As in America, it appears the police can act with impunity as they rarely face criminal prosecutions.\nOur government must take this opportunity to reassess the racial disparities in our own criminal justice system. Now is the time to end the severe class and racial inequalities which exist across the world.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_father-to-be-who-has-lived-in-uk-since-age-eight-facing-deportation/content_818.html": "Dad-to-be fights deportation to country he left as a child\nA Leicester father-to-be fears deportation despite living in the UK for most of his life.\nTawanda Bvumbe is currently being held in an immigration centre – where he has now caught Covid-19.\nTawanda, who lost refugee status after serving a five year prison sentence, is expected to be on a deportation charter flight to Zimbabwe by August 25.\nThe 30-year-old moved to the UK with refugee status at the age of eight. His father had died four years earlier and his mum had fled to the UK due to the country’s political unrest.\nHe joined his mum several years later after living with his grandmother for some time and spent his schooling years in Leicester, attending Taylor Road Primary School, Rushey Mead Secondary School and college in Kettering.\nTawanda later joined London Metropolitan University to study English Literature and Media.\nIn 2014, he was arrested and convicted for a crime he said he “was not involved in” under the joint enterprise law – which the supreme court ruled had been “misinterpreted for decades”. He was remanded to prison and unable to return to university.\nUnable to complete his studies, later in 2016, Tawanda became caught up in drug dealing which he was convicted for, along with possession of a firearm. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison – which he has now completed. His refugee status was also revoked.\nHe has since sought to turn his life around, working as a songwriter and recording artist and is also now a soon-to-be father.\n“I’ve done my time, this [deportation] is just extra punishment for me not being British,” Tawanda told LeicestershireLive.\nHe does not have any family or connections in Zimbabwe – a country that since moving away from as a child, he would “no longer recognise”.\n“I’ve got no one over there – my brothers and sisters, mum and partner are all here,” he said. “I’ve been here for most of my life this doesn’t make any sense.”\nWhile being held in Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre near London Heathrow Airport, Tawanda has been working with his solicitor to stop his flight.\nHis initial appeal was rejected but he said his solicitors have asked for judicial review.\n“This is a traumatic experience – my life is days away from changing, I don’t whether I’m coming or going,” he said.\n“I don’t have a clue what I will do if I get deported. I can’t imagine there will be many resources for people like me.”\nBut now a suspected outbreak of Covid-19 at the detention centre is causing further problems.\nIn the last few days, Tawanda himself has now tested positive for Covid-19 and says many others in the centre are also Covid-positive.\n“I tested negative before I got here and I was put in a cell with someone who wasn’t feeling well.\n“Most of the people in my wing are now waiting for results.\n“Covid has made it more difficult to access simple things now – like a computer so I can sort out my paperwork.\n“My life is dependent on this paperwork and I’m being told I have to wait.”\nTawanda joins dozens of Zimbabwean nationals at the detention centre who are set to be deported.\nA petition to stop the flight started by Black Activists Rising Against Cuts (BARAC) UK, has now gained more than 191,000 signatures.\nBARAC UK has been campaigning for years against mass deportation.\nAn earlier deportation flight to Jamaica left only seven of the 90 person target for it.\nZita Holbourne, co-founder of BARAC UK said: “The low numbers clearly demonstrate that they shouldn’t have been targeted in the first place.”\nShe added: “Black and Brown people already face discrimination in the criminal justice system in the UK.\n“And just by virtue of not being born in the UK, they are getting further punishment.”\nThe activist said a large number of people who have been targeted for deportation have served non-custodial sentences for minor offences.\nLeicester East MP, Claudia Webbe has called on the Government to abandon the deportation of Tawanda, saying the flights are “inherently wrong”.\nShe said: “The government’s deportation policy means that people face a triple punishment – a prison sentence, their subsequent time in harsh detention centres and then their removal to a country they often have no memory of, face persecution or are at severe risk in.\n“This is a cruel and unusual form of punishment that is disproportionately reserved for people from African, African-Caribbean, Asian and other racialised groups.”\nShe added: “My constituent, a British resident, is a talented artist, with a child on the way, he does not deserve to be deported and does not deserve to be in a detention centre with a known outbreak of Covid-19.\n“I want him back in my constituency with his family where he belongs. The situation is urgent, I am fighting daily for the life of my constituent and I have urged the Home Office to review this case as a matter of urgency.”\nThe Home Office has declined comment on this particular case but according to a factsheet published by the Home Office: “Where the person has claimed family life in the UK, the Immigration Rules state deportation is in the public interest unless the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.\n“In cases where a person has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, they will need to demonstrate very compelling circumstances over and above these factors.\n“All legal claims raised are fully considered and decided upon before deportation, first by the Home Office and then, if the individual is not satisfied with the decision and pursues a legal challenge or appeal, by the courts.”\nNo comment was made regarding the reported Covid-19 outbreak at the detention centre, but the Home Office blog states: “All individuals due to be on this flight will be assessed by a healthcare professional before they leave the Immigration Removal Centre.”\nThe factsheet says: “For those being deported on our upcoming charter flight to Zimbabwe, the Home Office is funding re-integration support provided by the International Organization for Migration.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Our residents hail from across the globe. At a time of international crisis, our communities are affected across borders. At the last count, I was responding to over 200 Leicester East residents who are currently stranded in countries around the world, and I am receiving new cases every hour. I have been helping constituents who are stranded in India, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Kuwait, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Australia, New Zealand and more.\nI have received very worrying messages from those with underlying health conditions who are particularly vulnerable and often running low on their medication. Many of the health issues include asthma, diabetes and other underlying critical health issues, so I am deeply concerned they are stuck in remote parts of the world. Amongst others who I have been helping are those who have had kidney and liver transplants. Another is pregnant yet cannot return home from Pakistan.\nBeing stranded abroad during an international pandemic is unbelievably distressing, especially as many of those affected are staying in temporary accommodation, which could shut down any day now, and where it is difficult to abide by social distancing measures.\nThe government has promised a new strategy on repatriations, but for those of us who have been campaigning on this issue from the outset – and especially for the Leicester East residents stranded abroad and their families back home – what has been announced so far is wholly inadequate.\nMore commercial flights are simply not an option for too many of my constituents. I do not believe that leaving people to rely solely on commercial options is acceptable. I have heard from constituents who have spent thousands of pounds on flights, only for them to be cancelled, often with no cash refund available. In one of many examples, two Leicester East residents with asthma and diabetes have paid for 4 unused flight tickets from Pakistan that have all been cancelled. The government should not be leaving people to the mercy of exploitative private airlines who are ripping vulnerable people off, without helping them to get home.\nThe Foreign Secretary has given vague promises about charter flights, but none of the commitments or urgency other countries like Germany have demonstrated. We haven’t been given firm answers to any of the specific problems being faced, from the loss of travel insurance and accommodation to dwindling supplies of medicine and money. We need a fresh, comprehensive, and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals’ home, using every option at the government’s disposal. That is not what the government has provided, and it’s not good enough.\nMany UK citizens have, quite rightly, shared their frustration about the lack of information and advice that they have received from the Foreign Office. Many Leicester East residents are stranded and even locked down in areas that have no international airport and no suitable internal means of transport available to the major cities which do.\nThe UK spent around £40bn on defence spending in 2019. As an extraordinary measure, I believe that RAF and military aircraft could be used to act as shuttle services to transport British nationals to the nearest appropriate international airport. Indeed, a similar strategy was leaked by government officials in a Telegraphreport on Sunday, before being rowed back a day later.\nThis would be an unprecedented step, but we are living through an unprecedented crisis. This diplomatic effort would need to be undertaken in the spirit of international solidarity, which is needed for us to combat this pandemic. The coronavirus crisis requires us to think big and challenge existing orthodoxies. We must do all in our power to bring our people back home.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_investigation-uncovers-claims-of-fresh-wages-scandal-at-leicester-garment-factory/content_889.html": "Investigation uncovers claims of fresh wages scandal at Leicester garment factory\nA whistleblower at one of Leicester’s garment factories has claimed her employer forces her to pay back part of her minimum wage.\nThe worker, who has not been named due to her fear of reprisals, showed Sky News payslips that formally record she is paid the minimum wage of £8.91 per hour.\nBut the wage slips had a number hand written on them which the worker claims is the amount she is told to refund to refund in cash to the factory after she is paid.\n“They say that you have to give this money back,” the worker told Sky News.\n“They said, you know, ‘I can’t give you minimum wage, I can’t afford to pay you minimum wage because prices are very low in our product.’\n“I’m worrying that if they find out that I’m not giving money back they might sack me.”\nEarlier this year, Boohoo cut ties with a number of manufacturers after saying they were unable to demonstrate the high standard of transparency required.\nAnti-modern slavery charity Hope For Justice then conducted its own investigation into the new measures which concluded the new audit and enforcement clampdown on exploitation by firms like Boohoo is not working, as “factory bosses are getting really creative and innovative” in how they hide it.\nThe whistleblower said that before Boohoo inspected the factory where she works, they were earning £5.50 an hour and the new system was put in place after Boohoo insisted that staff were paid the minimum wage.\nWhen LeicestershireLive contacted Boohoo about the worker’s claims, a spokesman released a lengthy statement saying they are committed to the highest standards of ethical compliance within its supply chain.\nThe comment did not address directly whether it was looking into the whistleblower’s claims. However, Boohoo did supply a comment from Group CEO John Little, which said: “As a group, we are wholly confident that the significant steps that we have taken over the last twelve months are resulting in a fair, robust and transparent supply chain.\n“The Group continues to closely monitor its suppliers, with swift action taken against any suppliers who fail to demonstrate the high standards that we expect. Nobody has done more to drive change in Leicester than ourselves, and our work continues unabated.”\nLeicester East MP Claudia Webbe has called for more to be done to protect workers in the city’s garment factories.\nShe said: “Sadly, worker exploitation in Leicester’s Garment Factories is nothing new. The practice of workers being forced to repay wages and holiday pay back to their bosses has been going on for some time.\n“This wage exploitation is not hidden. The problem is that too much of the onus to expose the extent of the exploitation is put back on workers themselves.\n“The brands and retailers know this is happening but continue to limit the nature of their audits to nothing more than a toothless tick box exercise.\n“I am dealing with cases every week of workers telling me about how poorly they are being treated and how wages are being stolen from them.\n“The workers want to remain anonymous because they remain fearful. The system is fully rigged against workers.\n“If a garment worker does manage to build the courage to go on the record, HMRC – which is meant to enforce the minimum wage – requires each worker to report their case via an online complaint form or via ACAS and even then it could take up to 6 months or more before anyone gets back in touch with the worker.\n“Meanwhile, the garment worker is left without support and no alternative. The government must do much, much more to support workers in Leicester – including reversing the funding cuts to HMRC.\n“When fast-fashion companies like Boohoo routinely sell clothes for a few quid or less, the factories in their supply chain are inevitably locked in a damaging race to the bottom. Not a single factory in Leicester has any formal union recognition. It is a vicious cycle.”\nBoohoo’s statement\nA Boohoo spokesperson said: “Boohoo is committed to Suppliers are wholly expected to adhere to these standards, and any concerns such as those raised by Sky News are immediately investigated.\n“Since last year’s Independent Review, the Group has repeatedly stated its determination in rebuilding a garment industry in Leicester with a robust, fair and transparent supply chain.\n“Suppliers are visited more frequently, sub-contracting has been removed, products can only be purchased from our approved supplier list; mandatory whistle-blower helplines have been installed at every supplier; and the use of technology is allowing the Group to forensically monitor suppliers and their financial records.\n“Over the course of the next twelve months, we are transitioning all of our suppliers to the Fast Forward forensic auditing model, widely recognised as the leading auditing model in the UK. We continue to work closely with local authorities such as the GLAA, as well as anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice who have stated:\n“Boohoo have been proactive in their measures to mitigate the risk of labour exploitation within their supply chains, and have made a strong commitment to tackling the unscrupulous and exploitative employment practices that still sadly exist within some suppliers to the garment industry.\n“We welcome Boohoo’s work with Fashion Enter and the new textile academy in Leicester, as well as their collaboration with Hope for Justice and our business-focused division Slave-Free Alliance on proposed awareness and prevention initiatives in the industry to better evaluate what intervention methods will be most effective.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_emancipation-day-august-1-should-be-an-official-british-bank-holiday/content_759.html": "Emancipation Day, August 1, should be an official British bank holiday\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nRacism benefits from a benign narrative that distances present-day injustices from past oppression, which is why it’s so important to highlight slavery as a vital chapter of our collective past, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nWE ARE approaching a monumental day in British and world history, yet one which is barely recognised or commemorated in Britain.\nOn August 1 1834, decades of anti-slavery campaigning culminated in the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.\nIn many of Britain’s former colonies this date is celebrated as Emancipation Day with either a bank holiday or a day of cultural activities.\nAntigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Canada, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines all have an official commemoration of Emancipation Day.\nIt is long overdue that Britain joins this global trend, and commemorates August 1 as a bank holiday.\nAs well as confronting our imperial history, this would also improve the lot of all English workers — who get four fewer public holidays than the EU average.\nThe EU average is 12.8 days, which is almost five days more than British workers get.\nLast year there were 17 public holidays in Japan, 12 in Australia and 11 in China and New Zealand.\nAll British workers deserve more bank holidays, and there is no better place to start than August 1.\nPresent-day global inequalities remain permanently shaped by the horrors of extractive colonialism and racialised subordination.\nThe brutal history of the British empire casts a long and enduring shadow on present-day global dynamics.\nWe cannot talk about the present without former empires engaging in a process of recognition, apology, returning what was stolen and reparations for past atrocities.\nIt is therefore vital that we understand the history of slavery abolition. It is a story of a mass movement and a struggle against the intransigence of vested interest that propped up an inhumane global system.\nDuring the slave trade, if one survived the horrors of the journey to be sold, the life expectancy on plantations was only 27 years.\nSlave rebellions were put down with untold brutality and the system of bondage was maintained by arbitrary punishment with slavers having complete impunity to kill and torture.\nSlave families were destroyed, and every sort of depraved abuse was forced upon men, women and children alike.\nUntil the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, Britain transported around 3.1 million Africans, to its colonies in the Caribbean, North America and elsewhere.\nTogether with Portugal, the two countries accounted for about 70 per cent of all Africans transported to the Americas.\nIn total approximately 17 million people, excluding those who died during transportation over a period of 400 years, were sold and exploited by Europeans.\nThe Abolition of the Slave Trade Act, passed by the British Parliament in 1807, outlawed the slave trade after centuries of activism and organised opposition to this institutionalised evil.\nYet this did nothing to free the existing enslaved workforce in the British empire.\nIn 1823, religious groups, politicians and supporters from around the country came together to form the Anti-Slavery Society.\nDuring the 1820s and early 1830s, a strong network of women’s anti-slavery associations developed.\nOver 73 women’s associations were founded between 1825 and 1833, which supplied a constant stream of information to rouse public opinion against slavery.\nThis is a proud history that must be commemorated and celebrated. The stories of brave fighters for emancipation, such as Mary Prince, an enslaved Bermudan who escaped from her owners shortly after her arrival in London in 1828, must be rescued from the anonymity of history.\nRebellions against slavery, in Barbados in 1816, Demerara (later a part of British Guiana) in 1823 and Jamaica in 1831-32 forced Parliament toward granting emancipation.\nBy 1824 there were more than 200 branches of the Anti-Slavery Society in Britain.\nIn August 1833, the Slave Emancipation Act was passed, giving all slaves in the British empire their freedom, albeit after a set period of years.\nPlantation owners received compensation for the “loss of their slaves” in the form of a government grant set at £20,000,000.\nIn contrast, enslaved people received no compensation and continued to face considerable hardship.\nThey remained landless, and the wages offered on the plantations after emancipation were extremely low.\nThe 1833 Act did not come into force until August 1 1834. The first step was the freeing of all children under six.\nHowever, although the many thousands of enslaved people in the British West Indies were no longer legally slaves after August 1 1834, they were still made to work as “unpaid apprentices” for their former masters.\nThese masters continued to ill-treat and exploit them. Enslaved people in the British Caribbean finally gained their freedom at midnight on July 31 1838.\nWhen British empire did abolish slavery, it provided 46,000 slave-owners — among them the ancestors of David Cameron, George Orwell and Graham Greene — with today’s equivalent of £17 billion, which equated to 40 per cent of its national budget at the time.\nThe British government only paid off its obligations to former slave-owning families and organisations in 2015.\nUntil then, in an injustice that heaps insult onto injury, black British taxpayers have been paying to compensate those that imprisoned our ancestors.\nWhile the narrative of Emancipation Day is that of an incomplete struggle and the reluctance of the British state against the bravery of committed activists, it is all the more vital that we continue to highlight and contrast this vital chapter of our collective past.\nBecause the brutality of modern racism in Britain cannot be separated from this history.\nThe perverse legacy of slavery continues to affect us in all walks of life, from police use of force to unfair immigration detentions to the disproportionate number of black children who go to bed hungry.\nThe mistreatment of the Windrush generation, which ensnared British residents in the government’s callous, racist hostile environment immigration system, also cannot be understood without an appreciation of these historical events.\nRacism benefits from a benign narrative that distances present-day injustices from past oppression. It is our duty to recognise the strong connections between historical and contemporary injustices.\nThe invisibility of those that paid with their suffering and their lives for the fortunes amassed by slaver owners and traders is part of the problem.\nThe victims have been erased from the narrative of history. This exclusion must end and their true place in history be restored — starting with a national curriculum which celebrates black people’s contribution to Britain and teaches the true, brutal history of the British empire.\nThere must also be a full review of statues and monuments which glorify perpetrators of historic atrocities, the legacies of which persist to this day.\nOf course, we need more than symbolic victories. The economic and social inequalities that plague Britain must be urgently addressed with a radical policy agenda, funded by taxes on the super-rich.\nYet present-day injustices are inseparable from the historical origins of racism and oppression. In order to overcome them, we must challenge how we remember our past.\nIt is therefore vital that Emancipation Day finally receives the national commemoration that it deserves with a bank holiday on August 1.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-cannot-delay-in-taking-action-to-save-our-planet-and-future-generations/content_574.html": "We cannot delay in taking action to save our planet and future generations\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nAs unpleasant as it is to think about, the fact is that an even more devastating crisis than Covid-19 is already here. Europe had its hottest year on record in 2019, and 11 of the continents’ 12 warmest years have occurred in the past two decades. Global grain yields have declined by 10% from heatwaves and floods connected to climate change, unleashing mass hunger and displacement. Over one million people living near coasts have been forced from their homes due to rising seas and stronger storms, and millions more are expected to flee in the coming years. The devastation of Cyclone Idai in Mozambique last year demonstrates the real and present danger faced by communities across the world.\nWith the Arctic Circle reaching its highest ever recorded temperatures, we cannot delay in taking action to save our planet and future generations. Sadly, we cannot rely on this government to take the urgent, radical action that is required to mitigate climate breakdown. Not only is their commitment to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 perilously unambitious, they are not even on track to meet it. Conservative governments have continued to give oil companies further tax breaks as recently as in December 2018.\nIt is up to the Labour Party to pressure the government into taking this life-or-death issue seriously. To do that, we must ensure that our own climate justice policies are commensurate with the scale of the crisis we face. As we emerge from the pandemic, Labour must argue for a new social settlement: a green new deal to rebuild the country with a more just and sustainable economy. Our party must fight for a society in which public health always comes before private profit. It must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs, not ordinary people.\nA good start would be to continue to support the recommendations of Labour’s 2019 report ‘Thirty by 2030‘, with policies including a ban on fracking, welcoming climate refugees and ecological restoration. The work of Labour for a Green New Deal is equally commendable in continuing to push for climate action to be at the heart of everything our country does as we rebuild after the coronavirus pandemic.\nLabour’s green recovery must include a call for one million green jobs, with a programme of investment in renewable energy, flood defences and a resilient health and care service. The party must also reiterate its call for healthy and sustainable neighbourhoods with the Warm Homes for All programme to insulate 27 million houses and introduce full-fibre broadband free at the point of use. The coronavirus crisis has showed the need for our communities to have access to clean air, green spaces and interconnectivity.\nThat’s why Labour must also call for a green, integrated public transport for the many. Railways should be nationalised, electrified, expanded and affordable. Regular zero-emission buses should serve every community, operated for the public good, not private profit. Our streets must be clean, safe and cycle friendly. It is vital that the protection of all workers and communities are guaranteed during the transition to renewable energies. The required investment and job creation towards a green industrial revolution will also be vital in the necessary post-coronavirus mass re-employment.\nAs we rebuild, Labour must continue to champion the need to bailout workers and the planet – not big polluters. We must consider a sector-wide aviation deal including public stakes in failing airlines to manage a just transition to renewable energy. Labour should ensure that government bailouts through the Chancellor’s Project Birch are subject to stringent commitments to workers’ rights, tax justice and rapid decarbonisation.\nWithout immediate government intervention, the urgent action required to preserve a habitable planet will be too slow. This will cause unimaginable disruption and could cost millions of lives, most immediately and sharply in Global South countries that have contributed the least to climate change. To ensure a global green new deal, Labour must strongly consider calling for the cancellation of Global South debt to enable investment in public health. The UK must take strong action against tax evasion, end international fossil fuel finance and rapidly step up financial support for a just global energy transition.\nMoments of crises often shape the future. From the horror of the Second World War, we created the welfare state and our treasured NHS. Whilst we rightly focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, the wellbeing of the entire planet relies on us also to take this opportunity to mitigate the existential threat of climate change. Labour must not let this historical moment pass us by.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_bahrain-why-the-silence/content_292.html": "Bahrain – why the silence?\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nDemanding change in Bahrain is the only fit way to honour the courage of Bahraini human rights activists, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLast week, in Parliament, I spoke at an event to mark the 12th anniversary of the 2011 uprising, in the presence of some of Bahrain’s most notable and courageous figures in the human rights movement, including Maryam Al-Khawaja, Dr Alaa Alshehabi and Husain Abdulla.\nMuch of Bahrain’s history has been characterised by remarkable progressive and egalitarian traditions going back a thousand years — a history that has put the people deeply at odds with the authoritarianism they have been forced to live under in recent decades.\nAnd I paid tribute to the guests, as well as to the journalists, academics, prisoners of conscience and others who have fought to extend that legacy despite torture, beatings, imprisonment and repression.\nThat repression continues to this day. Political opponents, like Abduljalil al-Singace, remain imprisoned, with 26 currently under death sentences for spurious terrorism offences, of whom almost half say they were tortured to extract confessions.\nTorture is used even on children, despite Bahrain’s signature to the UN convention against torture. Others have had their citizenship revoked, the powers of the security services to arrest have been returned and human rights enshrined in law are withheld at the whim of those in power.\nMuch of the international community has stood by, while others — including Britain — have profited from the sale of the very weapons to Bahrain that were and continue to be used to suppress protest and dissent.\nIn the build-up to the 2011 demonstrations, the regime in Bahrain tried to intimidate activists — 200,000 people, 40 per cent of the population. What activists were demanding was by no means extreme: a transition to a constitutional monarchy, greater political freedom, and equality for the 70 per cent Shia population.\nYet to put down these entirely peaceful protests, the regime unleashed what even the BBC had to term “brutal” suppression. So violent was this attack on peaceful protesters that Sinn Fein MPs speaking alongside me last week justifiably compared it to the events of Bloody Sunday and the British government’s treatment of independence protesters in Belfast.\nAnd the regime didn’t only use Bahraini police and military in these attacks, but brought in outside troops from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.\nThe horrors did not end with the arrests, injuries and deaths inflicted on peaceful protesters — including those attending a funeral for a victim: at least five people were killed by torture and an unknown number suffered while detained by the authorities after the protests.\nThere is no dispute about that, but as recently as a year ago Democracy for the Arab World Now (Dawn), an organisation founded by Jamal Khashoggi, reported that a culture of impunity continues in Bahrain.\nReligious bigotry and political cynicism also come together. Bahrain’s Shia majority Bharani opposition is routinely discriminated against in what the UN Human Rights Commission has described as “systematic harassment.”\nThis harassment involves arrests, detentions, interrogations and spurious criminal charges, including charges of terrorism simply for gathering peacefully — often on the excuse that Bahraini citizens will be acting as agents of Iran purely because they are Shia. The UN’s human rights experts described this treatment as “groundless accusations used to hide a deliberate targeting of Shias in the country.”\nAnd Bahraini exiles are not safe even here in Britain. Saeed Shehabi and Moosa Mohammed have taken the Bahraini government to court here for infecting their computers with spyware that allowed them to monitor correspondence, access files and even activate webcams and microphones to spy on live conversations.\nThe Bahraini government attempted to get out of the lawsuit by claiming state immunity — but last week the court threw out the bid and allowed the case to proceed.\nWhile the courts may be doing their job in defending the rights of Bahrainis in Britain, the same cannot be said of our government.\nThe British government has clearly decided to prioritise weapon sales — Britain lists Bahrain as a core client for arms exports. According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, Britain has licenced £105 million worth of arms to Bahrain since the pro-democracy Arab Spring started in 2011, and in the last three-year period has licensed at least £82m worth of weapons.\nBritain also provides substantial funding and training to Bahrain — through Foreign and Commonwealth Office programmes, and trades munitions with the country.\nOnly last week, the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy and Human Rights Watch accused the government of a “dangerous whitewash” in a Foreign Office report on Bahrain that they say will embolden human rights abusers, while Freedom of Information requests have shown that the Conservative government continue to send millions of pounds to the Bahraini government through the Gulf Strategy Fund.\nThe US, meanwhile, seems to have no intention of allowing the inconvenience of democracy and the abuse of human rights to disturb its own arms sales or its major military installation on the island.\nI believe we should all oppose the death penalty in all cases, regardless of who is accused, the crime, their guilt or innocence, or the method of execution.\nThe cases of Bahraini political prisoners Mohamed Ramadhan and Husain Moosa raised additional concerns, given the allegations, including from Amnesty International, that their confessions were obtained under torture and their right to a fair trial was grossly violated and yet they were given death sentences.\nWe must stand in solidarity with those fighting for democracy and human rights in Bahrain. Nothing less will do.\nWe must oppose authoritarianism wherever it raises its head.\nWe must refuse to accept anything less than full respect on the part of Britain’s government for human rights in Bahrain and everywhere else around the world where they are abused.\nWe must demand action to defend those rights, no matter the cost in trade — and we must demand an end to arms sales to despotic regimes and reject any attempt to whitewash the record of those regimes.\nSolidarity in the demand for change in Bahrain, in Britain and wherever else it is needed, is the only way to truly honour the fight and courage shown by those fighting for democracy and human rights in Bahrain as we remember the anniversary of the uprising.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_its-time-that-britain-recognised-palestine/content_471.html": "It’s time that Britain recognised Palestine\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nLater this week Parliament will debate formally recognising the state of Palestine. Now, with the Amnesty-led sea change in international opinion, is the time to finally do so — and end all arms sales to Israel, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIt has never been more important for the British government to commit to comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on a free Palestine and a two-state solution — a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine.\nThere can be no military solution to this conflict. That means an end to the illegal blockade, occupation and settlements. This week’s debate provides a vital opportunity for the government unequivocally to condemn Israel’s violations of international law, recognise the state of Palestine and work with the international community towards a future of peace and justice.\nA majority, 138 of the 193 United Nations members, have recognised Palestine. It is long overdue that Britain, and every other country, joins the majority of the international community who have recognised the state of Palestine.\nThe urgency for the international community to finally do so was underlined by a damning recent Amnesty International report which described Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians as “a cruel system of domination and a crime against humanity.” The report sets out how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law.\nIn international criminal law, specific unlawful acts which are committed within a system of oppression and domination, with the intention of maintaining it, constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid. These acts are set out in the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute, and include unlawful killing, torture, forcible transfer, and the denial of basic rights and freedoms. Israel enforces such a system against Palestinians through laws, policies and practices which ensure their prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment.\nWhether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. The report found that Israel’s cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid and a crime against humanity.\nThe report demonstrates that Israeli authorities treat Palestinians as an inferior racial group who are defined by their “non-Jewish, Arab status.” This racial discrimination is cemented in laws which affect Palestinians across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nFor example, Palestinian citizens of Israel are denied a nationality, establishing a legal differentiation from Jewish Israelis. In the West Bank and Gaza, where Israel has controlled the population registry since 1967, Palestinians have no citizenship and most are considered stateless, requiring ID cards from the Israeli military to live and work in the territories. The law also promotes the building of Israeli settlements and downgrades Arabic status as an official language.\nPalestinians are effectively blocked from leasing on 80 per cent of Israel’s state land, as a result of racist land seizures and a web of discriminatory laws on land allocation, planning and zoning. Illegal Israeli settlements today cover 10 per cent of the land in the West Bank, and some 38 per cent of Palestinian land in East Jerusalem was expropriated between 1967 and 2017.\nAmnesty International found that these acts form part of a systematic and widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population and are committed with the intent to maintain the system of oppression and domination.\nThe report identified that successive Israeli governments have considered Palestinians a demographic threat, and imposed measures to control and decrease their presence and access to land in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nThese demographic aims are well illustrated by official plans to annex areas of Israel and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which continue to put thousands of Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer. The widespread unlawful killing of Palestinian protesters is the most tragic and visible demonstration of this. In 2019 alone, Israeli forces killed 214 civilians, including 46 children.\nIsrael must grant equal rights to all Palestinians, in line with principles of international human rights and humanitarian law. It must recognise the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to homes where they or their families once lived and provide victims of human rights violations and crimes against humanity with full reparations.\nThe scale and seriousness of the violations documented in Amnesty International’s report call for a drastic change in the international community’s approach to the human rights crisis in Israel. Britain must recognise the Palestinian state, stand up for the inalienable human rights of Palestinians and actively support the enforcement of international law. Britain must consider the effectiveness of boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) to achieve these goals — as the international community did in the mission to end apartheid in South Africa.\nYet this will require a rapid U-turn on current policy. The British government has licensed at least £361 million worth of arms sales to Israel since 2014. The Campaign Against Arms Trade reported that previous government reviews have found it likely that British-made arms have been used against Palestinians.\nI am deeply dismayed that some of these weapons are made in my home city of Leicester. A subsidiary of Elbit Systems, which is situated in Leicester, supplies the Israeli Defence Forces with military equipment that is used in the illegal occupation and subjugation of Palestinian territories.\nThese sites are used for the manufacture of specialist military products and technology, including the SkyEye persistent surveillance system aboard Elbit’s Hermes 450 and 900 drones. They also manufacture the SpectroXR ultra long-range imaging system for Hermes drones.\nHermes drones have been used extensively by Israel in bombardments of Gaza, notably during Operation Protective Edge in 2014 in which over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, including 526 children. The site was also used for the production of IronVision helmets for use in battle tanks such as the Carmel – specifically designed for operations in densely built urban areas, such as Gaza.\nI recently asked a series of written questions to discern the British government’s level of support to Elbit Systems. These questions unearthed that the government granted two SIEL export licenses to Elbit Systems for components for body armour and military communications equipment that were completed on October 13, 2020 and January 25, 2021 respectively.\nTherefore, these two arms deals were completed just months before the latest Israeli bombardment of Palestine in May 2021, in which at least 256 Palestinians, including 66 children, were killed. The government must immediately end all sales of weapons that could be used unlawfully against Palestinian people.\nIt would not only be morally abhorrent for the government to continue its current, uneven policy towards Israel and Palestine — it would also be deeply hypocritical. In relation to escalating tensions in Ukraine, the Prime Minister in recent weeks said that “We won’t accept a world in which a powerful neighbour can bully or attack their neighbours. All people, no matter where they are born, have the right to live safely, choose who governs them and decide which organisations they want to be part of.”\nThese words could equally be applied to Israel and Palestine, yet for decades the British government has ignored and even abetted the Israeli system of apartheid. This intolerable situation must end. Britain must immediately recognise the state of Palestine and work towards ending the historical marginalisation of the Palestinian people.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_leicester-garment-workers-have-spoken-out-they-must-not-be-ignored/content_449.html": "Leicester garment workers have spoken out – they must not be ignored\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nLow-paid workers are challenging the behaviour of brands and retailers that drive down prices and care nothing for the well-being of those who make what they sell, reports CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nFOR many years, the abysmal situation of garment workers in Leicester has been an open secret.\nExploitation, manipulation, pressure and bullying at work have been rife. Illegally low pay, long hours and awful working conditions have been the norm.\nYet for just as many years, that open secret has been ignored, at both national and local level.\nGarment workers in Leicester, like their colleagues globally, face low pay, poor and hazardous working conditions, driven in large part by the exploitative behaviour of fashion brands and retailers, combined with lax enforcement of minimum wage requirements and shockingly low levels of workplace safety inspections.\nFrom 2017-20, only 60 health and safety inspections and 28 fire safety inspections took place among more than a thousand Leicester garment factories.\nIn the same period, HM Revenue and Customs made just 36 investigations into failures to pay the legally required national minimum wage.\nA 2022 study found that more than half of Leicester garment workers are paid below the legal minimum wage and attributed this to “ineffective or nonexistent law enforcement” and the failure to implement any changes from previous investigations.\nThe failures of government to protect low-paid workers in the garment industry and others has been appalling.\nFor too long, there was a compact of silence about this exploitation. Garment workers were pressured by their “boss” to keep quiet and toe the line, on a promise that if they remained quiet, they would keep their jobs.\nThat promise has proven to be false — years of loyalty to their factories and their bosses saw them lose their jobs anyway or their hours drastically cut to just 10 hours a week, despite their long service and apparent willingness to put up with exploitation and abuse.\nSome employers, meanwhile, have resorted to unscrupulous tactics: factories that have supposedly closed are now selling on sites like eBay, forcing workers into even more precarious work.\nAt a constituency level, I am now dealing with many — far too many — workers who now cannot afford their homes and cannot absorb their landlords increases in rent. Many are now also subject to Section 21 “no-fault” evictions.\nThis exploitation, which primarily affects south Asian women in my constituency, has helped to put 46 per cent of children from African, Asian, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and minoritised families in Leicester into poverty — and 38 per cent of Leicester children overall are in “low-income families.”\nThis has risen in just five years from 30 per cent, four times the average national increase in a country hit hard by Tory austerity and conscious cruelty.\nMy constituency of Leicester East, where many of these factories are based and where many of their workers live, is the worst-hit constituency in the city.\nFour in 10 of our children are living in outright poverty, affecting their health, their growth and their mental well-being. It also affects their ability to study, reducing their life chances and their prospects of providing better for their own children in turn.\nThe business model of many of these factories are not viable or sustainable, especially in a global culture of predatory business practices by brands and retailers.\nToo many manufacturers have relied on just one or two brands or retail chains — and when those brands, like Missguided, goes bankrupt or as we saw Boohoo do earlier this year, drive down prices in their never-ending pursuit of greater profits, the house of cards collapses.\nSome manufacturers are now accepting prices below what it actually costs to produce the clothing.\nIn such circumstances, it is always going to be the workers, those least able to withstand it, who are hardest hit.\nThis brand and retailer behaviour in Britain has, of course, been accompanied by the classic globalist drive to produce in countries where workers are even easier to exploit and can be paid even less.\nExploitation and injustice are built into the system by design and enabled by governments.\nThe fashion industry works like this — those retailers and brands, the companies with the least regard for the environment and for people have the greatest competitive edge.\nWhen Boohoo — under pressure over another scandal about the treatment of the workers who make its clothes — published its supply chain list in 2021, more than a third of its source factories were in China, with Turkey next, then India.\nOf almost 12,000 factories it declared, only 96 were in the UK, with another 300 or so scattered among other poor countries. This is exploitation on a mass scale: around the world an estimated 430 million people work directly on producing the clothing that rich nations buy and wear.\nBut now the conspiracy of silence is ending as workers speak up and fight back. Leicester garment workers, showing huge courage and resilience in the face of the pressures forced on them, are demanding to be heard.\nOn Sunday October 1, hundreds of Leicester garment workers gathered together publicly and spoke out against their exploitation, poor treatment and the authorities’ dereliction of duty.\nAlmost 50 years ago, workers at the Imperial Typewriter factory went on strike against exploitation and low pay.\nThose workers, mostly south Asian women, held up a banner that read: “We fight for our dignity and respect.”\nThat strike started small, just 39 workers, but their example drew others to them in their hundreds, inspired to stand together for better.\nIronically, the building in which they used to work is today dilapidated but houses hundreds of garment workers, working in garment factories, in conditions so poor that workers are often seen going in and out using the building’s external fire exit stairs — but for the Imperial Typewriter strikers, the lesson of their courage and resistance has endured far better than a run-down building. It is one that the brave garment workers are following.\nI was proud to stand with Leicester garment workers to challenge the behaviour of brands and retailers that drive down prices and care nothing for the well-being of those who make what they sell, and against exploitation by factory owners.\nThe fight of those workers against poverty wages, non-unionised workplaces, zero-hours contracts and worsening conditions is every socialist’s fight, and we must stand with them and all who, like them, are fighting for better against a worldwide system of greed, exploitation and corruption that keeps workers poor and insecure while corporations and a few individuals make huge profits.\nIn this country we are seeing workers in a variety of industries stand up and say “enough is enough.”\nNow the garment workers are doing the same and demanding an end to decades of neglect and inaction by those in power — and demanding fair and decent work from those who profit from their labour.\nThese workers, overwhelmingly women are speaking up for themselves and for others.\nThey must not be ignored. Local and national governments must, at long last, play their role in preventing illegal pay, poor conditions and unsafe work environments, but the global fashion industry must also correct their systems and practices to end exploitation and provide decent jobs at fair rates of pay for all.\nThe global fashion supply chain is huge, from the cotton fields to the factories. If we turn the capitalist system on itself, workers have the power to take control of the means of production. Our role is solidarity.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-we-need-real-system-change-to-end-fossil-fuelled-capitalism/content_810.html": "To tackle the climate crisis, we need real system change to end fossil-fuelled capitalism\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nIt is clear that the government must make a complete U-turn in its approach to climate justice, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE climate crisis is no longer a distant threat; it is already here.\nThe upcoming Cop26 conference provides a crucial opportunity to address this existential threat.\nYet the government is proceeding with a number of destructive, environmentally damaging initiatives that make a mockery of its claim to be a leader on climate justice.\nPerhaps the most worrying of these is an application to drill oil in the new Cambo oil field. Siccar Point Energy and oil giant Shell have applied to the Westminster government for permission to drill in the field, which is around 80 miles west of Shetland.\nCambo is the second-largest undeveloped field on the British continental shelf, containing a potential 800 million barrels of oil. If approved, drilling would begin next year.\nPhase 1 of the proposed project would seek to extract 170 million barrels of oil — the climate equivalent of running 18 coal-fired power stations for a year.\nIt would continue until 2050 — five years after Scotland is due to reach net zero emissions.\nPhase 2 would continue beyond 2050 and aims for “full-field development” — in other words, the extraction of all available oil.\nIt is estimated that the emissions from burning all 800 million barrels of oil in the field would be 10 times the annual emissions of Scotland.\nIndustry body Oil and Gas UK has claimed that Cambo is needed to support British energy demand and reduce reliance on imports.\nHowever, the current situation is that over 80 per cent of UK crude oil is exported — adding Cambo’s oil would therefore only vastly increase global oil supply.\nFurthermore, the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) recent report, Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, states that to reach global net zero by 2050: “There is no need for investment in new fossil fuel supply” and that there should be “no new oil and gas fields approved for development.”\nIt is important to remember that the 5.7 billion barrels of oil and gas in already operating UK oil and gas fields will already exceed our share of the Paris climate goals.\nTo allow Cambo to go ahead would severely undermine Britain’s ability to demonstrate leadership on tackling climate change at Cop26.\nThe government must reject the application, wind down fossil fuel extraction and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.\nAnother worrying carbon-intensive initiative is the application to drill oil in Horse Hill, Surrey.\nIn 2019 — months after declaring a climate emergency — Surrey County Council granted planning permission for an oil development in Horse Hill that would extract three million tonnes of oil over 25 years — the burning of which would produce more than 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.\nLocal resident Sarah Finch challenged the council’s decision in court. The case is opposed by the council and two interested parties: Horse Hill Developments Limited (the developer) and Robert Jenrick MP, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government.\nIn December 2020 the judge initially ruled that the developer did not have to consider emissions from burning the oil — not just from the development directly in the planning application — so the council acted lawfully.\nThis flawed logic sets a dangerous legal precedent which would allow countless similar fossil fuel developments to make their way through the planning system — and this judgement is already being cited by other developers.\nThe court’s decision is being appealed in November on the basis that the initial ruling incorrectly interpreted the National Planning Policy Framework and Mineral Planning Practice Guidance, and that it failed to take into account the government’s perilously unambitious 2050 net-zero target.\nThe government cannot claim to be a world leader on climate while spending taxpayers’ money to back a development that would extract three million tonnes of oil up to almost the net-zero deadline.\nAt Cop26 Britain will be asking other nations to transition away from fossil fuels, submit their own net-zero commitments, and provide climate financing for global South countries.\nTo avoid this glaring hypocrisy, the government must withdraw its support from the Horse Hill court case and begin to tackle the climate crisis with the urgency it demands.\nA final, deeply concerning British-based initiative is the Whitehaven coalmine.\nWest Cumbria Mining Ltd (WCM) wants to build a new coalmine just south of Whitehaven.\nCumbria County Council provisionally granted planning permission in October 2020, but this decision is currently under a public inquiry.\nCoal is currently needed in steel production, yet British Steel has said that the sulphur content of WCM coal may be too high for it to use.\nThe International Energy Agency has said that there is enough coking coal in mines already operating to meet global demand until 2050, and the climate change committee has said that coal use in steelmaking could be displaced completely by 2035, just halfway through the mine’s proposed lifetime.\nIf the mine is approved, it would be Britain’s first new deep coalmine for 30 years and will produce 2.78 million tonnes of coal per year until 2049.\nThis coal will be used exclusively to provide coking coal for the steel industry.\nHowever, less than 10 per cent is intended to be used by the UK steel industry, with the rest exported abroad.\nAt a time when the steel industry is decarbonising, it is vital that we transition away from coal towards green hydrogen and other renewable forms of energy.\nCumbria Action for Sustainability has calculated that 9,000 green jobs could be created in Cumbria in the next 15 years, including 4,500 in west Cumbria, in sectors including renewable energy, waste management, industry, retrofitting buildings and green transport.\nPersisting with the coalmine further undermines Britain’s credibility at the upcoming Cop26 conference. The government must step in and prevent it from happening.\nThe government is not only embarking on damaging domestic projects but is also exporting its climate destruction abroad.\nIn July 2020 Britain pledged £720 million of UK Export Finance (UKEF) to an offshore liquid natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique.\nInterest and investment in the LNG project have fuelled local conflict and human rights abuses, from both the Mozambique government-backed forces and mercenaries and an armed insurgency.\nThere is evidence of energy companies (Total, Eni and ExxonMobil) paying the government to deploy soldiers to protect their interests.\nThis increased military presence has led to reports of human rights abuses by the army, such as killings of local people and the extorting and blackmailing of families.\nThousands have been killed, almost 700,000 displaced and many are left without homes or livelihoods.\nThis project will also speed up climate breakdown and devastate the coast, threatening Unesco-listed nature sites.\nThe liquefaction process is incredibly energy intensive, making it even worse for the environment than natural gas drilling.\nThe construction phase alone was estimated to increase the greenhouse gas emissions of Mozambique by up to 10 per cent by 2022.\nThis project is therefore incompatible with Britain’s commitments under the Paris Agreement — and there are many more like it across the globe.\nThe government must immediately withdraw all funding and support from the Mozambique LNG project and instead invest in renewable energy and other sustainable projects in the region and around the world.\nIt is clear that the government must make a complete U-turn in its approach to climate justice, especially so close to such an important global summit.\nThe most urgent priority at Cop26 is to ensure that we stick to the 1.5°C target that was set in the Paris Agreement of 2015, and protect global South countries that are disproportionately at risk.\nA 2030 net-zero target is essential to meet the scale and severity of this crisis.\nBritain must also end all subsidies for fossil fuel companies, which are estimated to cost $5 trillion per year worldwide.\nWe must forge a new social settlement — the government’s appropriation of the Green New Deal brand is simply lip service designed to greenwash an ongoing commitment to the status quo of fossil-fuelled capitalism instead of a real commitment to system change and rebuilding the country with a more just and sustainable economy.\nWe must consider every urgent and radical action, including the global working class using its economic power to shut down environmentally destructive industries and push hard for the nationalisation of fossil fuel companies, to save our future.\nUltimately, it must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs — not ordinary people.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_britains-benefit-sanctions-is-beyond-cruel/content_524.html": "Britain’s benefit sanctions is beyond cruel\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nPunishing those in need doesn’t work from any perspective — that is why the Tory government is refusing to allow access to its own data. It is clear that we need a total overhaul of the system, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIt’s almost five years since the Economic and Social Research Council, a government-funded public body, told the UN’s human rights body that the British government’s drive to extend and intensify benefit sanctions “systematically undermines the very idea of economic and social rights as a core component of national citizenship status and/or justifications for such rights on the basis of universal human needs,” making many benefit claimants unable to meet those basic needs for food, warmth and shelter.\nThe UN agreed, concluding that despite its denialism, the government was breaching the human rights of benefit claimants at every turn. The UN repeated its call as recently as November 2022.\nDespite the clarity of the warnings, the government did nothing to improve its treatment of the most marginalised — in fact, since then the situation has only gone downhill. The number of people suffering sanctions hit record levels in 2022.\nAnd the Conservative government is determined to drive that number higher still, threatening DWP staff with disciplinary action and even dismissal if they fail to sanction enough claimants.\nThe government still claims that evidence “clearly shows” that its sanctions regime is “clear, fair and effective” in getting people into work.\nBut if that was truly the case, why does it need to hide its data from experts who want to study that effectiveness?\nIn reality, the benefit sanctions are an utterly inhumane blunt instrument that has not shown to be effective in its supposed aim — and there is no study that disagrees.\nInstead, almost every study that has looked at the benefit sanctions regime seems to find the word “cruel” — and indeed “pointlessly cruel,” according to a parliamentary select committee, and “cruel, inhuman and degrading,” according to academics — to be appropriate for the horrific reality that the experts conducting the study found.\nBritain’s sanctions regime is enormously disproportionate and punitive — a complete withdrawal of support for missing a single jobcentre appointment, with examples easy to find of people sanctioned because of illness or other reasons outside their control.\nAnd mindbogglingly, that cruelty can be imposed, with little effective scrutiny, for up to three years.\nBritain is an international outlier in this cruelty. Data submitted to the work and pensions select committee in 2022 showed that Britain is unique among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations in the use of sanctions to punish claimants — and the most recent study on the impact of sanctions shows that they are not only ineffective but indeed often make people more likely to remain out of work while the small minority that manages to find work find themselves shuttled from insecure job to insecure job that often pushes them even further into poverty because of the way the system deducts money from their benefits based on earnings that they may no longer be making.\nThis consciously cruel and punitive regime is operating at record levels — in 2022 more than double its pre-pandemic numbers — in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis that even huge numbers of people in regular work are struggling to cope with.\nAnd of course, the more vulnerable a claimant, the greater the impact of this intentional cruelty will be.\nThe government cannot claim to be unaware of this — as noted, it has been repeatedly warned by MPs, academics, advocacy groups and the UN of the huge damage being done to those most vulnerable.\nThe damage is mushrooming at an almost unimaginable rate. Even while the pandemic continued, universal credit claimants were said to be more likely to be under a sanction than to have Covid — and all this is continuing in the middle of the worst cost-of-living crisis in living memory.\nAnd while all this is happening, the government is actively impeding attempts to understand the scale of the damage and whether its policies actually achieve anything beyond inflicting suffering.\nIn February of 2022, the government blocked access to data for academics who wanted to study whether benefit sanctions were driving up suicide rates, bringing a vital study that was already under way to an immediate halt.\nThe government buried its own research and refused repeated requests — including Freedom of Information Act requests — for the data, claiming that the information was “sensitive” and, ridiculously, that it was in the public interest to hide it.\nEven for the Conservative Party this is an astonishing level of disregard for people’s mental health and indeed for their lives — and the government is operating a shameless culture of secrecy about the impacts and effectiveness of their policies.\nBut information already in the public domain showed that a staggering 43 per cent of unemployed disability benefit claimants had attempted to take their own life because of the horrors inflicted on them — and that was in 2018, long before sanctions reached their current appalling high.\nClearly, if the data showed that benefit sanctions achieved what the government claims, then the Tories wouldn’t need or want to hide the information.\nWhen I see the way benefit sanctions are applied in Leicester East, which has one of the worst median annual pay levels at £20,300 than most of the country, it becomes clear that the benefit sanctions are a tool of capitalism to preserve capital accumulation even when there are low-paying, poor-quality and insecure forms of wage labour.\nBritain’s benefits system clearly needs a repair far more fundamental than merely a new coat of paint or brand name.\nThis country’s welfare system is shockingly weak — according to OECD data, British citizens see their income drop by 84 per cent if they become unemployed.\nThis is the second worst of all OECD nations and ahead of only Hungary — but even Hungary is far more generous than Britain for the first six months of unemployment.\nBritain is acting as a rogue state in its treatment of its most vulnerable citizens, ignoring international norms and evidence that the benefit sanctions regime is doing enormous damage.\nWhen the UN condemned the intentional impoverishment of millions by government policy as a breach of their human rights, the government responded by attacking the UN and its motives.\nOur welfare system is meant to be a safety net to ensure that nobody in our society falls into extreme want or deprivation.\nThe extensive and draconian use of benefit sanctions and the policing of our labour market demonstrates that something is going badly wrong: rather than preventing hardship, benefit sanctions are being used as a blunt instrument to needlessly and without any cloak of dignity exacerbate poverty, hunger and starvation.\nBenefit sanctions have become a stigma to further marginalise, cause injury and abandon Britain’s most vulnerable citizens.\nOur priority as socialists must be to resist and transform this unjust system for the benefit of all.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_political-leaders-must-demand-peace-and-justice-in-palestine/content_472.html": "Political leaders must demand peace and justice in Palestine\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nIsrael’s trauma is not a free pass for war crimes, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIN THE wake of this month’s Hamas attack on Israeli settlements, the British government, along with other Western governments, gave vocal and emphatic backing to Israel’s “right” to “defend itself.”\nThis support has been undiluted even though Israel has cut off food, water and medical supplies to the civilian population of Gaza and unleashed a mass air assault on this tightly packed residential area — according to media reports, more bombs were dropped on tiny Gaza in 10 days than the US dropped on Afghanistan in its first year of operations there.\nIsrael has also ordered more than a million Gazan civilians, half of them children, to leave northern Gaza and cram into a tiny area against the Egyptian border.\nThe United Nations Office for Human Rights has condemned this as “mass ethnic cleansing” that looks set to be on an even worse scale than the 1948 Nakba, or catastrophe, that saw 750,000 innocent civilians violently driven from their homes, the area that is now Israel.\nThe Palestinian people are now overwhelmingly a refugee population. In a clear sign of what arguably could be described as Israel’s real intent, Israeli ministers have openly called for “another Nakba” to be inflicted on Gazans.\nThe UN secretary-general and its Human Rights Agency have said emphatically that Israel’s actions toward civilians in Gaza are a war crime, while the UN children’s agency has condemned the appalling physical and psychological impact on children.\nYet the British government has continued to support such actions as part of Israel’s “right to defend herself,” tacking onto its statements a line saying that Israel must follow international law, as if murdering civilians can somehow be done legally.\nThe government’s stance was mirrored by the decision of opposition leader Keir Starmer who appeared to tell radio broadcaster LBC that Israel has a “right” to impose the cut-off on Gaza, a position which also appeared to be supported by members of Starmer’s front bench during various now-notorious media interviews.\nThis one-sided response of the British Establishment has also been seen in Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s order to police forces to treat even displays of the Palestinian flag as a potentially criminal act, leading to a number of arrests at Palestinian solidarity demonstrations.\nThe government has also pledged extensive direct military support for Israel against Gaza, a region in which children represent half of the population.\nHowever, collective punishment is a war crime, under international law, against Gaza’s 2.5 million civilians — as is forced transfer of populations.\nBoth the blockade and the evacuation order have been condemned as such by an array of human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, as well as by the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.\nViolence toward civilians is wrong and atrocious in all circumstances, but it is clear that the Israeli government’s decision to blockade approximately 2.5 million Gazan civilians is criminal under international law.\nUN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has rightly called for an immediate end to this illegal action and to demand urgent humanitarian relief for the people of Gaza.\nSupporters of the war defend Israel’s mass bombing by pointing to the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Gazans to leave the area before the Israeli bombing campaign.\nBut the brutal reality is that most are unable to leave what has been described as the world’s largest open-air prison, even if they want to, leaving innocent civilians to suffer horrific and indiscriminate violence that has even killed doctors and United Nations personnel.\nThe mass killing at the al-Ahli hospital was just one instance of the targeting of hospitals and other civilian buildings.\nThe Beit Hanoun hospital was destroyed from the air and the attack on the al-Shifaa hospital damaged its neonatal unit and Israel has warned all 22 remaining hospitals to evacuate — a clear breach of Article 8(2)(b)(ix) of the International Criminal Court Statute against the targeting of civilian locations.\nThe World Health Organisation has said the demand is impossible to carry out and that any attempt to do so will be deadly to critically ill, vulnerable and fragile patients.\nThe bombing of schools run by the UNWRA — which provides assistance and protection for Palestine refugees — has killed children, teachers and staff.\nThese attacks make a tragic mockery of claims that the bombing is targeted only at Hamas infrastructure and personnel.\nAfter Israel’s claim that Hamas was responsible for the al-Ahli atrocity fell flat, Israel published audio supposedly between two Hamas fighters discussing a misfired missile hitting the hospital — but audio analysis by Channel 4 News exposed the “recording” as a fake, with the programme’s chief correspondent Alex Thomson reporting that “several experts confirm” that the audio tape of “Hamas” operatives talking about the missile malfunction “is a fake. They say the tone, syntax, accent and idiom are absurd.”\nMany thought the al-Ahli Arab hospital would be a turning point for a ceasefire.\nIndeed, it can be argued that Israel was worried about the increasingly negative reaction among ordinary people to its actions — and the potential for the outrage to provoke a reaction from Arab neighbours and a decline in support from Western governments.\nBut rather than respond to this violence and the ensuing claims and counterclaims in line with public outrage, with condemnation and a call for both sides to end violence, the British government doubled down on its support for Israel and its continued illegal operation, sending ships and spy-planes to the area.\nIsrael is one of the world’s top 10 military powers and a major pillar of US hegemony in the Middle East. It is arguably the most heavily militarised state in the world.\nIsrael’s armed forces are among the most technologically sophisticated in the world. It is one of nine countries to have nuclear weapons. Its military power is funded heavily by the US. Indeed, it can be argued that Israel has always had the support of the main imperial powers.\nIn the aftermath of the air strike on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital, a UN security council resolution that was tabled by Brazil calling for “humanitarian pauses” failed because the US voted against, effectively vetoing a ceasefire.\nBecause the US is one of the five permanent members of the UN security council its No vote was enough to stop the resolution.\nBritain and Russia abstained, with the other two permanent members China and France voting with 10 others, largely from the global South, in support of the resolution.\nArguably this demonstrates how wars in other places, particularly in the global South, are sustained and maintained, suffering significant civilian killings and which do not even receive media attention.\nLike many elsewhere who have been driven from their land and who sustain daily regulation and control, imprisonment, abductions and killings, Palestinians deserve nothing less than liberation.\nSolidarity, struggle and working-class rebellion across the Middle East might well be one of the only solutions with the capacity to liberate Palestine.\nWhat happened onOctober 7 2023 was horrific, but Israel’s trauma cannot be a “free pass” for war crimes.\nThe people of Palestine and the people of Israel alike need peace built on justice — as does the whole region.\nThis will not be achieved by unequivocally backing the powerful against the powerless.\nThe British government and international community must demand an immediate ceasefire, release of captives on both sides and urgent talks to achieve a just, binding and sustainable peace.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-war-on-woke-must-not-be-normalised/content_830.html": "The ‘war on woke’ must not be normalised\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Tories’ point-blank refusal to acknowledge structural disadvantages by scapegoating ‘the whole agenda’ instead must be resisted wholesale if we want to address racial and social inequality, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE race to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister has descended into a grotesque lurch to the right, with Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak trying their utmost to outdo each other with ever-more divisive, nonsensical and damaging policies.\nThe two Tory leadership contenders have both outlined tax cuts that would further enrich the wealthy at a time of immense inequality and hardship, and have rolled out Thatcherite union-bashing policies which are so draconian that they prompted threats of a general strike from union leaders.\nYet perhaps most concerning is the concerted “war on woke” that has come to define this race-to-the bottom leadership contest.\nJust last week, Sunak vowed to stop “woke nonsense and left-wing agitators.” Sunak pledged to “stand up to left-wing agitators” and “protect British freedoms” if he becomes prime minister.\nThis warped perception of freedom includes reviewing the 2010 Equalities Act which ensures people with protected characteristics are not discriminated against and taking instead a backwards step on gendered and racial equality. Similarly, Jacob Rees-Mogg MP — when supporting Truss’s plan for cuts to Whitehall staff and pay — said that diversity roles are a “job creation scheme created by the woke for the woke.”\nThese culture wars have dominated the Tory leadership debate, despite YouGov polling showing just 8 per cent of Conservative Party members want “combatting the woke agenda” prioritised.\nYet when we consider the demographics of the Tory Party membership, it is hardly surprising that this “war on woke” has dominated the headlines. Our next PM will be chosen by around 200,000 people — or 0.29 per cent of the UK population — who are overwhelmingly male (71 per cent) and white (97 per cent). More than half are over 60 and their stance on the climate crisis and LGBT rights tends to differ greatly from that the public as a whole.\nIt is important to remember that the term woke has been intentionally misinterpreted as a stand-in for all things annoying by the right-wing press. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as “aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)” — something that we should all aspire to be.\nThe practical effect of this war on woke has taken shape in many forms, most revoltingly with both leaders’ pledge to accelerate the Rwanda deportation scheme. Amnesty International and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants were amongst the charities criticising Sunak and Truss for their “cruelty and immorality” for promising more Rwanda-style deals to remove asylum-seekers from Britain, as charities claimed the pair were pandering to party members’ hard-line views.\nWe must not normalise this sickeningly reactionary policy. It is designed to dehumanise asylum-seekers, pit our communities against each other and distract from the many crises we face. It demonstrates that there are no depths this government is not willing to sink to in order to divide and rule our country and protect its interests.\nThere is no such thing as an illegal asylum-seeker. This policy will do nothing to clamp down on trafficking gangs; instead, it further penalises their victims. The policy is designed to stoke the flames of hate, and to dehumanise people fleeing unimaginable suffering. It erodes the basic human decency upon which governance should be operated. It must be abandoned, not extended by those vying to be the next Prime Minister.\nThe war on woke has dominated the leadership campaign from its beginning. The first televised debate, broadcast on Channel 4, saw Kemi Badenoch — the candidate endorsed by Britain First — attack Penny Mordaunt for allegedly supporting trans people’s right to self-identify.\nThat is the same Badenoch who, as the Conservative minister for equalities, said: “I don’t care about colonialism” and that it made no real impact on people living in colonised areas. This is not only factually inaccurate, given the millions of murders (direct and indirect), sexual abuses and extraction of natural resources inherent to imperial projects — but is typical of this government’s point-blank refusal to acknowledge structural disadvantages and the pervasive legacy of empire.\nThe government has cynically presented racism as an individual failing, not a systemic experience which is driven by powerful institutions.\nThe government’s aim to individualise racism and to claim that discrimination is no longer a societal issue is the expression of the Thatcherite dogma that “there is no such thing as society.” Yet this is a crisis that requires collective solutions. That is the mission that faces of all of us, to reject this government’s attempts to divide us up and to fight — together — for a world free of racial and class inequalities.\nThe government must drop its pathetic, counterproductive crusade against recognising institutional racism and outline a target-driven plan to end the shocking racial disparities that continue to plague our global society.\nDespite what our government and Tory leadership candidates believe, it is simply not the case that the existence of institutional racism is up for debate.\nFor instance, it is beyond dispute that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate impact on African, Asian, Caribbean and other racialised communities. These inequalities are grounded in class inequalities and reflect the severe racial disparities in our economy.\nThe Resolution Foundation think tank estimates that black, Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi employees experience an annual pay penalty of £3.2 billion. The grim intersection of racial and class discrimination has had deadly consequences in recent years.\nDiscrimination is deeply ingrained in our social, political, and economic structures. The scourge of institutional racism results in unequal access to quality education, healthy food, liveable wages, and affordable housing — which are the foundations of health and wellbeing.\nThe war on woke has a devastating impact on policy. For instance, the government’s flagship Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill introduces longer prison sentences that are explicitly aimed to stoke divisive culture wars.\nThe fact that this legislation could introduce longer sentences for damaging a statue than for assaulting a woman reveals how utterly unserious this government is about tackling gendered violence.\nThe criminal justice system should not be reduced to political point scoring, yet the Conservative government is shamelessly using arbitrary and disproportionate prison sentences to fan the flames of division. This is the by-product of anti-woke legislation, and if the Conservative leadership contest is anything to judge by we can sadly expect more of this to come.\nThere is a dangerous connecting current that runs between the Policing Bill and many other initiatives taken by this government. They all reveal a deeply troubling broader political project, which is designed to divide our communities against each other and distract from the real causes of inequality and injustice.\nWith a Tory Party governing with an authoritarian, Thatcherite agenda that is obfuscated with the rhetoric of “levelling up” and the gleeful embrace of racist culture wars and the politics of division, it is vital that we on the left do not compromise our anti-racist and internationalist principles. It is up to all of us who believe in a better, fairer world to stand against those who wish to pit communities against each other so they can preserve an unjust economic system.\nAs the radical Angela Davis said, “If we don’t take seriously the ways in which racism is embedded in structures of institutions, if we assume that there must be an identifiable racist who is the perpetrator, then we won’t ever succeed in eradicating racism.”\nNow is the time for us to interrogate our systems of government so that we can end the global scourge of racism, no matter what form it takes. That’s the true meaning of woke — and the fact our future prime minister, be it either Truss or Sunak, is so opposed to that basic concept of justice is a matter of grave concern.\nAs Fred Hampton put it, we do not fight racism with racism, but with solidarity. That is the mission that faces all of us on the left today, to reject this government’s attempts to divide us up and to fight for a world free of racial and class inequalities.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

In a matter of two weeks, the health system collapsed.”\nShowing a lack of preparation and support, this area was one of the worst effected last year and it has been reported that it currently lacks oxygen and health devices for its patients, as well as PPE and other equipment for medical staff.\nThe human impact of such failures is very real – in January in Manaus over 50 people died due to the lack of oxygen and intensive care unit (ICU) beds.\nYet just as the country faces another catastrophic rise in the deadly virus, incredibly Bolsonaro decided now was the time to again discourage the use of masks and encourage more ‘opening up.’ Such a response typifies that of the far and hard-right across the globe, always putting the short-term interests of few to make profit ahead of the needs of people and their health, and indeed the long-term interests of the economy,\nAnd earlier this year, the far-right President astonishingly said “I can’t do anything,” whilst seeking to blame the media and regional governments for the health and economic crises.\nIn light of his disastrous handling of the pandemic, and associated failures in so many other areas of public policy including unemployment rising to 14 million, it is perhaps not surprising that opposition to Bolsonaro is growing.\nA recent weekend for example saw demonstrators in over 70 cities against the far-right President, with people rallying to demand an immediate and free COVID-19 vaccination for the entire population, and calling for Bolsonaro to go.\nProtestors also called for the return of COVID-19 related emergency relief packages which the Government astonishingly recently suspended, when 40 million Brazilians live in extreme poverty.\nAnd as has happened since the start of this crisis, thousands of people across the country bang their pots and pans regularly to call for Bolsonaro to go.\nAdditionally, over 70 impeachment requests have been submitted to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies against Bolsonaro, ranging from issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; police brutality and racism, the destruction of the Amazon and the rocketing of poverty.\nOpposition is not just from left-wing ‘usual suspects’ – a coalition of religious leaders also recently issued a call for his impeachment, backed by 17 Christian movements and 380 bishops, priests, and pastors.\nAccording to a recent poll from Datafolha, Bolsonaro’s popularity is plummeting fast. The amount of Brazilians that considers the president’s administration bad or the worst, increased from 32 percent to 40 percent in just one month, from December 2020 to January 2021.\nAnd the unpopular President can also expect further resistance against further right-wing policies that have recently been announced, including the privatisation of the country’s natural parks, including natural spaces in the Amazon. He has also announced relaxing gun laws to much public dismay.\nInspired by Trump’s recent defeat in the US, the growing resistance in Brazil deserves massive international solidarity – from the need to put people and their health first in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, to the need to protect our environment, to making the slogan of ‘Black Lives Matter’ a reality, their fight is our fight.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_bds-is-under-attack-because-it-works-and-south-africas-case-against-israel-reminds-us-why/content_53.html": "BDS is under attack because it works – and South Africa’s case against Israel reminds us why\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Anti-Boycott Bill is designed to hobble democracy and decency, but it’s also a sign the government is rattled says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST week, the government’s Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill, better and more accurately known as the Anti-Boycott Bill, passed its third reading in the Commons despite a rebellion by a number of Tory MPs horrified at the attack on free speech and peaceful protest that it represents.\nThe Bill aims to ban councils and other public bodies boycotting, disinvesting or sanctioning any country unless the national government also does, depriving local authorities of a vital way in which they can represent the interests of their residents and have an international influence for good.\nSo profound is the attack on free and democratic speech that it even bans councils from saying they would back a boycott if they were able to.\nBut the Bill leaves no doubt about where it is really aimed: it specifically excludes Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories from even national government action, banning ministers from ever removing the ban on sanctions against Israel, no matter what actions Israel may ever commit in future — and as we have seen in South Africa’s “airtight” case against Israel before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the state of Israel is all too ready to resort to war crimes to achieve its ends.\nIn large part this Bill is a reaction to the success of Leicester City Council — the introduction to the Bill says so explicitly — in defeating legal attempts in 2018 to force it to end its boycott of goods, under the grassroots “boycott, divestment and sanctions” campaign, from illegal Israeli settlements until Israel complies with international law and ends its illegal occupation.\nArguably, Leicester’s stance has been thoroughly vindicated by events of the last few months, in which Israel has launched what South Africa and many UN bodies have called “genocidal acts” on Gaza and which has killed hundreds in the West Bank, where Hamas is not active, protecting Israeli settlers as they beat and even kill Palestinians trying to go about their lives peacefully.\nThe Netanyahu regime’s war crimes since October 7 are not limited to charges of genocide by any means, with crimes against humanity, collective punishment and more seeming to take place daily.\nYet while Leicester and other councils have been shown to be doing the right thing, it can be argued that the government has found itself, yet again, on the wrong side of the issue, bringing in a new law to side with the oppressor against the oppressed and giving the Israeli regime licence to kill tens of thousands and commit any war crime with impunity.\nMany in Leicester East back the council’s actions and bitterly oppose Israel’s crimes against Palestinians and the illegal settlements whose proliferation has only accelerated. The Anti-Boycott Bill, if it becomes law, will prevent Leicester and councils like it from carrying out the will of the voters who elected them, tying the hands of those who want to take principled action and enforcing the will of a British government that has shown it prizes geopolitical and economic ends above the lives of tens of thousands of innocent children, women, teachers, doctors, aid workers and journalists.\nIt is a Bill designed to hobble democracy and decency and to subjugate local British democracy to the actions and wishes of a foreign, occupying power. Arguably, it is also intended to circumvent the will of the court, since Leicester City Council comprehensively won its case.\nThere is a straightforward reason that the Israeli government expends so much time, effort and funds to fight Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions internationally and that the British Establishment feels the need to make laws to forbid it. BDS works.\nA boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign lasting almost three decades was a vital factor in bringing down South African apartheid — and boycotts by local governments played a crucial role in pressuring the Thatcher government into adopting boycott as a national policy.\nSouth Africa knows all about the power of such a peaceful but resolute campaign and the results it can achieve without bloodshed.\nThe BDS campaign against Israel and the companies who support it, is just as powerful, which is why Israel established its Ministry of Strategic Affairs with a specific brief to delegitimise the campaign.\nBDS has hit Israel hard for years and has accelerated since Israel began the killings, slaughter and forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza. Workers in ports around the world are refusing to load or unload Israeli and Israel-bound ships; academic and student associations in a variety of countries — including the US — have voted to back the campaign and have refused funding from Israeli institutions; Veolia divested its Israeli business because BDS campaigns were costing it billions in lost contracts; and just as anti-apartheid artists boycotted South Africa, many have endorsed a cultural boycott of Israel and have cancelled or refused to agree events there.\nCompanies like McDonald’s and Starbucks have admitted suffering a serious impact on their profits because of the widespread boycott of their products and services because of their perceived support for the Israeli regime.\nAnd even when Israel and its supporters attack the people and organisations making a principled stand, the publicity serves to raise public awareness of Israel’s injustices against Palestinians — an awareness now higher than ever.\nThis is so effective that a 2018 article in Israeli newspaper Haaretz described every Israeli reaction, crackdown, expulsion and legal attempt to ban BDS, even the creation of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs itself, as a “success” of the BDS campaign — because, far more importantly than the economic impact of the boycott, the campaign was forcing Israel to shred its claims to democracy and liberalism in front of the eyes of the world.\nWe have surely seen more than enough of the Tories’ lack of respect for law and accountability in their attempts to denigrate South Africa’s forensically compiled genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.\nYet even some Conservative MPs have stepped forward to express their horror at Sunak’s Bill. Kit Malthouse described it “an illiberal and draconian” attack on non-violent protest and freedom of speech at the very moment such protests need to be supported and enabled.\nSouth Africa’s prominence, having invoked the Genocide Convention against Israel, is a perfect reminder of the importance of boycott, divestment and sanctions in ending injustice — and of the horrors of the injustices that need to end in Palestine.\nYet the government is refusing to support South Africa’s case against a country that has killed more than 12,000 Palestinian children in just three months — despite only seven weeks ago putting its signature to Gambia’s genocide case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, against Myanmar, specifically because of Myanmar’s treatment of children.\nThe government’s assault on the peaceful campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions, to protect an apartheid regime, brings shame on Britain and its political system. Even to attempt to pass this Bill is an international scandal.\nEveryone who wants to see an end to the genocide in Gaza and to the endless other brutalities and injustices inflicted on the Palestinian people needs to redouble their efforts, to ensure the Anti-Boycott Bill does not become law.\nHowever, if this Bill becomes law, we need to be ready to support the legal challenges that experts say have a high chance of success and to raise awareness about the organisations that are enabling Israel’s oppression and occupation, so that ordinary members of the public boycott them.\nAlongside the legal case brought by Israel at the Hague, BDS is the best prospect for improving the situation of the Palestinians and ultimately ending the occupation and oppression they face.\nIf it wasn’t, we wouldn’t be seeing such attacks on it.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_test-and-trace-is-better-for-private-profit-than-public-wellbeing-it-needs-to-be-abandoned/content_756.html": "Test and trace is better for private profit than public wellbeing. It needs to be abandoned\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nSadly, instead of prioritising health, our leaders are facilitating an unscrutinised handover of collective prosperity to wealth share holders, says CLAUDIA WEBBE\nAlmost since the start of the coronavirus crisis, we have known that in order to edge safely back towards normality, a fully functioning test and trace system is essential. For months, our government has claimed that the UK will have a “world beating” system to combat the virus.\nYet instead they have presided over a failed programme that prioritises the enrichment of private corporations over the protection of our communities.\nRather than trust local health experts and the public sector, the Department of Health has placed its trust in corporate outsourcing giants such as Serco, Sitel and Capita. These companies have virtually no experience in public health initiatives – but do have many allegations of price gouging and workplace malpractice.\nThe government still hasn’t published its contracts with these outsourcing giants, and a recent letter signed by more than 100 leading health professionals and public figures urged the government to act with greater transparency. According to the Treasury, £10bn has been allocated to England’s test and trace programme. In contrast, £300m of additional funding has been offered to local authorities to support devolved trace systems.\nDespite this clear lack of funding, local trace systems far outperform their corporate rivals.\nThe Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Independent Sage) said the centralised testing system “basically just isn’t good enough” and shows no signs of improvement. The government’s own emergency science group says the target to ensure the virus doesn’t spread further is finding and reaching 80 per cent of all close contacts of symptomatic cases.\nYet in Blackburn, where health chiefs are battling a major outbreak, leaked analysis shows that the national tracing service is reaching only 52 per cent of all close contacts – and this figure reflects the national average.\nMy home city of Leicester is a prime example of the contrasting success of the local public health-led trace systems. Due to the hard work and diligence of local authority workers, as well as their instantaneous access to local knowledge and multiple sources to obtain contact details, the success rate of Leicester’s system is 85 per cent.\nYet when Peter Soulsby, Leicester City mayor, requested that this effective model be granted more responsibility, the national Contact Tracing and Advisory Service rejected this plea.\nEssential local data is still not flowing to neighbouring public health departments because the government is pouring billions of pounds into private sector companies which have no experience of test and trace. Engaging the private sector to capture the data is demonstrably inefficient, and local public health teams, NHS laboratories and Public Health England can do this much better. This is what happens in other countries like Germany, which is partly why they’ve only had a sixth of the deaths the UK has.\nWith the government pursuing a commercial strategy, rather than a public sector solution, we do not have an integrated or coherent system with interpretable data. Instead, we have a collective ignorance in relation to crucial local information. We need the government’s failed test and trace system to be replaced with a fully public health sector-run find, test, trace, isolate and support system, as argued by the Independent Sage.\nMembers of Independent Sage also highlighted the fact that people who are less well off will find it very hard to take 14 days off work when they know they won’t be paid or, worse, will lose their job. This reflects the situation on the ground in Leicester, where our spike in cases was linked in part to the fact that low-paid British citizens on informal or zero-hour contracts and those with undocumented immigration status or “no recourse to public funds” were unable to safely isolate or take time away from exploitative workplaces.\nIt should be simple: if you get contacted by test and trace, you must be provided with the material means to isolate. It is impossible for impoverished people to comply with guidance on self-isolation and social distancing. It is not just morally imperative but in the best public health interest of everyone in our country that people’s basic needs are met.\nYet sadly we do not have a government prioritising public health. We have a government facilitating an unscrutinised handover of collective wealth to the pockets of wealthy shareholders.\nAfter suspending commissioning rules, government ministers have awarded exclusive coronavirus-related state contracts worth more than £1bn to private companies. To give just one example, Randox, a private healthcare firm, has been awarded a £133m contract without any competition.\nRecently, it was unearthed that as much as £177m of taxpayer money was wasted on a contract with a company Andrew Mills, an adviser to Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is a senior board adviser for. The company had no experience of providing health equipment, and the contract was for Ayanda FFP2 masks which are so defunct they fail compliance tests and thus cannot be used by the NHS.\nOutsourcing businesses including Deloitte, KPMG and Sodexo have all secured taxpayer-funded commissions to manage Covid-19 testing centres, the procurement of equipment and the construction of hospitals.\nThis gives the impression that the Conservatives and sections of big business are seeking to use the confusion of the current crisis to force through a new wave of what Naomi Klein termed the “Shock Doctrine”, in which public funds are paid to the private sector with little or no oversight.\nThe wasteful experiment of the private sector in our test and trace system must end. The government must urgently prove that they value public wellbeing over private profit by introducing a fully nationalised system that empowers local authorities to protect our communities.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_a-british-member-of-parliament-wants-the-sotik-massacre-included-in-the-national-curriculum/content_419.html": "MP wants Sotik massacre taught in all British Schools\nClaudia Webbe MP for Leicester East wants the Sotik massacre taught in all British schools.\nClaudia Webbe, Member of Parliament for Leicester East House of Commons, London in a Letter dated August 7, to the Secretary of State for Education, House of Commons London, Rt Hon Gavin Williamson sought to have the 1905 Sotik massacre included in the curriculum.\n“I am writing to you regarding the Sotik massacre of 1905 and the need for the Government of the United Kingdom to ensure this historical injustice is included in the national curriculum,” read the letter.\nThe call by the MP comes as a result of increased calls for schools to teach the brutal history of the British Empire and legacy of imperialism, racism and colonialism during the Black Lives Matter movement.\nWebbe noted the legacy of imperialism, racism and colonialism continue to have generational impact.\nThe letter indicates the violent interference of the British Empire in Kenya started at the end of the 19th century and lasted until Kenyan independence in 1964.\nAccording to Webbe, it is vital that young people are taught the true history of race relations.\n“If we are to end the scourge of institutional racism and the destructive legacy of colonialism, it is vital that young people are taught the history of race relations. I urge you to ensure this atrocity is included in the National Curriculum,” read the letter.\nDifferent cultures\nThe Sotik Massacre is a result of failure by the Sotik people to heed to an ultimatum by the British colonial government to return cattle stolen from the Maasai in a traditional raid. Such ultimatums were unknown in the culture of the local people and the colonial forces committed a massacre. Over 1,800 men, women and children were killed.\nWebbe said massacres led by a Major Pope-Hennessey has been airbrushed from British history.\n“There has never been any form of apology and no reparations ever offered for this act of historic genocide. There is a collective amnesia of this atrocity,” she stated.\nWebbe observed that the UN Special Rapporteur has written to UK’s government requesting a response and none is yet to be received.\nIn 2019, Kenya National Lands Commission ruled that the Kipsigis and Talai didn’t only lose their property, but were subjected to various forms of human rights violations.\nIn 2018, Kericho County, through Governor Paul Chepkwony, successfully lodged a complaint with the UN Special Rapporteur in Geneva claiming over 90,000 acres of land was given to white settlers.\nIn the process close to 115,000 people were forcefully removed from their ancestral lands by the British army.\nKimutai Bosek, one of the lawyers representing the communities in the case in Geneva, said they support the move by Webbe.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_endemic-poverty-must-be-treated-as-the-national-scandal-that-it-is/content_539.html": "Endemic poverty must be treated as the national scandal that is is\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe cost-of-living crisis will not be one that is felt equally, warns CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nFOR Christmas this year, this Tory government of the super-rich has given the British public a cost-of-living crisis that will hit the most vulnerable hardest.\nBetween the uncontrolled pandemic, inflation and the end of Covid support schemes, households across the country are facing a difficult winter.\nUK household incomes could be down £1,000 next year, according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank, as rising prices combine with welfare benefit cuts and rising taxes.\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research says a typical family will lose £500 a year because of the planned increase in National Insurance and an expected 5 per cent rise in council tax.\nMany households now face a “triple whammy” of energy price rises, the planned National Insurance tax rise and the impending £20 cut to universal credit — which will see six million families lose over £1,000 a year.\nBefore the pandemic 14.5 million people in the UK were living in poverty, equating to more than one in five people — most of whom are in work — and this has increased significantly due to the inequitable impact of the virus.\nEnergy bills may rise as much as 30 per cent, home rental is up 8.5 per cent, and household debts are soaring.\nThe Food and Drink Federation believes food prices have risen by 9 per cent in time for Christmas.\nInflation increased by 4.2 per cent in October, the highest in a decade. That’s more than double the Bank of England’s target and there are fears it could rise to 6 per cent. This means that everyday items are only getting more expensive.\nFood and drinks prices are up across the country, playing a major role in Britain’s cost-of-living crisis. According to the Office for National Statistics, supermarket prices increased by 1.1 per cent in August, which is the sharpest rise since around the financial crash in 2008.\nOn top of this, Boris Johnson announced a planned National Insurance increase which will see workers paying around 1.25 percentage points more in deductions, which equates to at least another £254 to the tax bill of a median wage earner.\nThis will take effect in April 2021 — just when energy bills are next expected to increase.\nThis tax will hit young, poorly paid people hardest, taking more out of their pay packets at a time when wages are failing to keep up with Britain’s cost of living.\nIt means a landlord who rents out dozens of properties won’t pay a penny more, but the tenants working in full-time jobs will.\nThe rise in National Insurance means graduates earning over the UK average of £27,295 will now pay a marginal tax rate of 42.25 per cent once student loan repayments are included — which is more than the people earning over £100,000 a year.\nMeanwhile, the billionaires, large corporations and super-rich that the government truly represents continue to pay a lower rate of tax than people who are struggling to make ends meet.\nFor all their empty talk of levelling up, the Conservatives are continuing to rig the economy in favour of the privileged few. Wealth does not trickle down.\nBritain’s energy system has also been plunged into chaos, which threatens to rip through the economy and hit home energy suppliers.\nThis has stoked fears that a further wave of energy suppliers will collapse, and that households will be saddled with unaffordable bills at the coldest time of year.\nGas prices in Britain have more than quadrupled over the last year, and energy bills rose by an average of £139 in October.\nEven before the current energy price crisis, an appallingly high number of residents in my constituency of Leicester East were forced to make the impossible choice between keeping their family warm or going hungry.\nWhen I became an MP, 5,800 households in Leicester East were in fuel poverty — 14.4 per cent of the constituency.\nFaced with a sharp energy price rise, the government is now refusing to take the necessary action to combat poverty and protect families in Leicester and across Britain.\nOn top of this, the heartless decision to cut universal credit, which robbed 15,350 working-age families in Leicester East of £1,040 a year, and introduce a regressive National Insurance tax increase that hits working people hardest has exacerbated an already untenable situation.\nWe must challenge the government to raise its ambition by setting a fuel poverty eradication target, as well as a commitment to end all forms of poverty for good.\nThis can be achieved by raising taxes on those who can afford it most — the super-rich and big businesses. The nationalisation of failing energy companies must not be ruled out.\nThis crisis is not one that will be felt equally. Those in poverty already spend the highest share of their incomes on daily essentials.\nPoorer households pay as much as 50 per cent more on their utility bills than the wealthiest. Britain’s poorest 10 per cent of households pay on average £756 a year per person for gas and electricity.\nA far smaller average of £504 per person is spent in the richest households, with the national average spend being £530 on utility bills.\nThe poorest households spend proportionately around seven times as much of their funds on energy as the richest households, and three-and-a-half times the national average.\nAs the inspiring James Baldwin once said “anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.”\nThis crisis also disproportionately impacts young people, who have been repeatedly ignored by this government.\nAnalysis by think tank Demos revealed that people aged 18 to 30 were facing the “greatest uphill battle” to make ends meet during the cost-of-living squeeze.\nAfter half a century of neoliberalism, too many people are forced to live pay cheque to pay cheque — meaning they are always teetering precariously over a financial cliff edge.\nI commend all foodbanks, in Leicester and across Britain, for their role in providing food to vulnerable people both before and during the pandemic.\nI have volunteered with many foodbanks in my community, and I know from first-hand experience the incredible selflessness that is involved.\nHowever, as a nation, we run the risk of creating a scenario in which the foodbank becomes the norm and a means of papering over obscene inequality and endemic instability.\nIndeed, it is grotesque that millionaire members of the current government have said that they found this situation “rather uplifting.”\nIt is appalling that, in one of the world’s richest countries, front-line workers are paid poverty wages and are forced to live on the generosity of others.\nWhile foodbanks are currently necessary due to widespread poverty in Leicester and across the country, over-reliance on them is a symptom of our unsustainably unequal society.\nOur priority must be to fight for a future that is built around solidarity and dignity, and in which poverty, hunger and foodbanks are a thing of the past.\nIt is not radical to argue for wealth taxes, a £15 minimum wage for all workers and to bring water, rail, energy and mail back into public ownership — these are the basic essentials.\nAs we enter 2022, we can no longer live in a society defined by extreme inequality. We must now collectively act to force the government to step aside or change course to prevent the further impoverishment of the working class.\nUltimately, the government must start treating endemic poverty as the national scandal that it is.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

They were happy to capitalise on a surge in online shopping during lockdown, without caring about the effect this would have on vulnerable workers.\nThis is the worst form of predatory, neoliberal capitalism, in which corporate profits are prioritised above human rights and wellbeing.\nAfter this crisis, the obscene wealth of the few can no longer be built on the exploitation of the many.\nJon Ashworth, Liz Kendall and myself all call upon the chief executive to resign following these findings.\nRead the full article in the Guardian here.\n“The UK’s duplicity is shameful.

However is unlikely to happen given it’s lace on the order paper.\nThe bill originally introduced by Gavin Newlands MP would prevent employers from forcing workers to sign up for wage cuts and inferior conditions under threat of dismissal.\nSee the full letter and signatories below;\nThe Yemeni conflict is one of the worst humanitarian crises of the modern era. It is shameful that, as a result of UK arm sales, it is happening in our name.\nThe UK government must accept its complicity in this catastrophe.\nAnd it must follow the lead of countries like Germany, France and Denmark by ensuring that no weapons made in our country are used in the conflict.\nThe Overseas Operation Bill is the second piece of legislation which is predicated onbreaking international law that the government has introduced – and that’s just this week alone!\nThis is the ‘Global Britain’ we were promised. One which alienates itself on the world stage, and which endangers both our armed forces and civilians around the globe.\nOur commitments to human rights and the wellbeing of our armed forces are not in conflict with one another.\nI was so proud to speak at the most recent Socialist Campaign Group Rally with Jeremy Corbyn MP, Diane Abbott MP, John McDonnell MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Richard Burgon MP, Ian Lavery MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP, Jon Trickett MP, Ian Mearns MP, Shami Chakrabarti, Lloyd Russell-Moyle MP, Apsana Begum MP, Ian Byrne MP, Ian Mearns MP and Zarah Sultana MP.\nAlmost 4,000 people registered for the Zoom event, thousands watched it live on various streams and over 85,000 people have watched it so far.You can watch the video here.\nSheila Mosley is a Leicester activist and one of the organisers for Status Now.\nI tabled EDM 658 in parliament and the meeting helped to organise the next stages of our campaign including this public meeting.\nThis meeting saw the Status Now Network coming together to discuss the importance of safety for everyone, and the need for all undocumented people and those in legal process to be given Leave to Remain in the UK.\nIt was an honour to meet these wonderful people; Rogelio aka Ogie (Kanlungan Filipino Consortium), Loraine (Coventry Asylum and Refugee Action Group – CARAG), Faith(Birmingham Asylum and Refugee Association), Munya (Regularise, Rhetta (Refugee andAsylum Participatory Action Research – RAPAR) and myself (Quaker Asylum and Refugee Network – QARN) and Ian Hodson from the Baker’s Union.\nI really enjoyed taking part in this important event with the Institute of Employment Rights alongside some fantastic speakers!\nThe pandemic revealed that some seven million ‘key’ workers, essential to maintaining the fabric of society, are amongst the worst paid and least legally protected of the entire workforce. Join us to discuss how we can tackle this gross injustice and give workers the respect, dignity and pay they deserve.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/claudiaforLE/\nThis is a well deserved award for the As-Salaam Trust\n@Th3PeaceCentre. They’ve given so much to support our community, helping everyone from day one, long before the 1st lockdown in March. They identified what would be needed and acted quickly so that no one would be left behind.\nThey received £1500 for the ‘In This Together’ fund extension and I am proud to have put them forward.\nhttps://westernpower.co.uk/customers-and-community/in-this-together-communitymatters-fund\nThis is another exceptionally busy week in Parliament, with key debates on Brexit, international human rights and the Yemeni conflict.\nIn each of these debates, I will raise the concerns of Leicester residents and urge this government to work in the interest of everyone in our city.\nTo Jewish communities in Leicester East, throughout the UK and across the world I wish you a happy Rosh Hashanah. After the challenges of recent times I hope the New Year brings happiness, peace and a better future for all.\nShanah Tova\nThe right to strike is a cornerstone of our democracy.From to fairer pay to weekends, everything that makes the lives of workers tolerable has been won by generations of struggle.\nI am proud to support this campaign to #FreeOurUnions. Click here for full article.\nCutting off the Job Retention Scheme in six weeks time will plunge millions of people into poverty when they most need help and protection.\nEnding furlough too soon could see unemployment soar to over 4 million. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in Leicester East has more than doubled since the UK lockdown began.\nThis will increase even more if the Chancellor goes ahead with his cliff-edge timetable.\nThe government must extend the furlough scheme and prioritise the well being and security of our communities.\nIt’s absolutely vital that our NHS is protected from trade deals.\nNow more than ever, it’s vital that people in Leicester who are grieving can access the support they need. That’s why I joined a cross-party group of MPs who wrote to theHealth Secretary, supporting Sue Ryder’s call for a #BereavementSupportBubbles policy in future lockdowns. To see the letter click here.\nSee video for details on how to get in touch with me below.\nDuring the 2019 General Election, the Prime Minister claimed that his ‘wonderful, fantastic’ Brexit deal was ‘oven-ready.’ Less than a year later, he wants to break international law in order to rewrite it.\nThis self-inflicted crisis is either a cynical negotiation tactic, or a pathetic attempt to distract from this government’s calamitous record over the last few months.\nPeople in #Leicester know more than anyone else the cost of this government’s incompetence. With Covid-19 cases increasing across the country, we must focus on defeating this virus and protecting our communities.\nYet instead, this government is reopening the Brexit wound they were elected to heal.\nThis is a busy and important week in parliament, with key Brexit legislation and debates on economic support to workers during the coronavirus.\nIn each of these debates, I will raise the concerns of Leicester residents and urge this government to work in the interest of everyone in our city.\nThe emergency business loans issued so far have been made to firms in high carbon emitting industries such as chemicals, aviation and automotive manufacturing BA,Virgin, Rolls Royce, Toyota I am arguing for a test based on climate considerations to always be included before loans are granted.\nThe aviation sector is the third largest in the world and the largest in Europe and thisGovernment must do all it can to protect an industry that is worth £28 billion to our economy.\nThere are some in the aviation industry whose standards and treatment of workers falls well below acceptable levels, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, such is the case of British Airways and its parent company IAG.\nThe crisis in our aviation industry is a microcosm of the government’s botched economic response to this pandemic.\nRather than prioritising jobs and workers’ rights, they have allowed redundancies to mount. Rather than ensuring that public funds are used in a fair and sustainable way, they have allowed corporate greed to fester.\nThe government must now reverse its approach by protecting workers and the planetinstead of corporate profits.#BAbetrayal #BritishAirways\nI was proud to support today along with many more MP’s who joined this morning in sending a loud and clear message to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak that the jobs that built our economy need. #JRS2NOW! #SOS4Jobs\nWith under eight weeks until the furlough scheme ends, workers from across the UK will launch their SOS for Jobs campaign to persuade the prime minister to think again on a focused sector level extension of the job retention scheme (JRS).The JRS is set to end on 1 November with ministers refusing to consider any extension or modification.\nWorkers and their union, Unite fear that without a change of heart from ministers a tide of job losses will engulf UK manufacturing as employers lose confidence in the future with demand yet to return to pre-Covid levels.\nThe workers are further concerned that with competitor nations offering long-term support for their manufacturing base, UK jobs will disappear while our competitors inFrance, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland and even the US are protected. https://unitetheunion.org/sosforjobs\nI stand in solidarity with all BBC workers who have bravely shared their experience ofracism. Only by shining a light can we eradicate the disease of institutional racism. Thatmeans a full public inquiry into the systemic racism of our public service broadcaster. Iwill do all I can in parliament to push for this to happen. It is up to the government toenforce existing recommendations to combat this evil.\nSolidarity to all Bolivians fighting to defend their social, political and economic rights in the face of repression from the country’s coup government.\nThe violent interference of the British Empire in Kenya started at the end of the 19th century and lasted until Kenyan independence in 1964. The appalling Sotik massacre of 1905 must be included in the national curriculum.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_lives-are-being-put-at-risk-through-the-downskilling-of-the-nhs/content_733.html": "Lives are being put at risk through the downskilling of the NHS\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe government’s latest cost-cutting NHS manoeuvres are a risk to patient safety – they must be vigorously opposed, warns CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE British government is preparing to legislate for new “regulated” medical roles in the NHS that it claims will “improve patient safety”: “medical associates.” However, the government and the NHS admit that these roles are not qualified doctors and that they form a key part of the government’s “long-term plan” to increase the NHS workforce.\nThe new plan for these semi-qualified roles to be regulated by the General Medical Council will drive the supposedly “safe” “expansion of medical associate roles to support doctors and GPs,” amounting to a padding out of NHS numbers to allow costs to be driven down through a “downskilling” of the NHS workforce.\nThe absence of proper workforce planning since the Conservatives entered government in 2010 was highlighted by the King’s Fund earlier this year as a major cause of the struggles of the NHS, yet the Tories’ response to that now is to fill positions with people who are not as qualified as those the NHS has lost.\nThe dangers of this downskilling — and the reality of the “medical associate” plan — can be seen in the case of 30-year-old Emily Chesterton, who died in October last year after a blood clot in her leg was twice misdiagnosed by a “physician associate,” one of the three types of medical associates, as a calf sprain.\nEmily’s mother said that her daughter had believed she was being treated by a GP and therefore trusted the diagnosis, and that if she had known that wasn’t the case, she would have rushed her to hospital. Last March at the inquest into her death the coroner concluded that after presenting with her symptoms, she “should have been immediately referred to a hospital emergency unit.”\nHealth Education England has claimed that the role and clinical duties of medical associates “cannot, and will not, be as extensive as those of a doctor.”\nBut among their duties, according to NHS England, physician associates “perform physical examinations/diagnose illnesses/see patients with long-term chronic conditions/perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures/analyse test results/develop management plans/provide health promotion and disease prevention advice for patients.”\nPhysician associates, like the other types of medical associates, which have similarly broad roles, receive just two years’ training.\nAnd funding for these associates is locked in and not available for training doctors. In fact, hospital-based training experience is often prioritised for associates over the needs of doctors, because unlike doctors they are not “rotated away” from their departments every four months — a situation forced on doctors by Health Education England.\nArguably, this has led to a situation in which associates and nurses are performing procedures that are usually done only by skilled and experienced surgeons.\nIn June, Leicester’s Glenfield hospital tweeted to “congratulate” a nurse for performing a “transcatheter aortic valve implantation,” (TAVI), a heart procedure normally performed by cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists, to the horror of the medical community.\nKeele University cardiology Professor Mamas Mamas responded that “this is so inappropriate on so many levels. This is not safe for patients particularly given that there are numerous TAVI-trained medically qualified operators in UK. You have also taken away training opportunities for medical/surgical trainees.” The hospital deleted its tweet.\nMamas is far from alone. According to a British Medical Association (BMA) survey of almost 19,000 doctors, conducted last month and published last week, there is a “shocking scale of concern” among medical professionals about the “medical associate” system.\nNine out of 10 doctors say that the way that the “medical associates” work is “always or sometimes” a risk to patient safety. A similar proportion “reported that they did not think the public understood the difference between the roles of physician or anaesthesia associates and the role of doctors.”\nThe government and NHS England are ploughing ahead with the plan regardless.\nThen-shadow health secretary Diane Abbott warned in 2016 of the dangers of NHS England’s “increased reliance on volunteers and the downgrading of treatment by skills, responsibilities and pay bands” as part of a package of highly damaging (2014-19) policies explicitly about creating opportunities for private healthcare.\nThe BMA, the Royal College of Anaesthetists, the Doctors Association UK, GP groups and other medical organisations are right to oppose this recklessness with patients’ lives and with public trust in the entire NHS.\nBut this issue runs much deeper than some one-off “flawed” policy — and it is not some kind of response to unavoidable circumstances. Instead, this is a deliberate driving down of skills, and therefore costs, which forms a key part in the government’s corporate-driven “Integrated Care” plan to ration care and rationalise it into a small number of cost centres and reward them for underspending against their budgets — in other words, to incentivise them to withhold care by making it profitable for them to do so.\nI have been opposing Britain’s adoption of the US government’s “accountable care organisations” (ACOs) — now called Integrated Care Systems (ICS) in England.\nA deliberate system of incentives ensures that the NHS and its regional providers will keep cutting the corners of what was our comprehensive, universal NHS and turn it into a state-funded service that business can profitably provide, like the inadequate US Medicare, so that everything else becomes a luxury for those who can afford to pay.\nThis is the legislative and policy backdrop for the planned and fully intentional downgrading of the NHS from a world-leading healthcare service into one that now lags well behind its peers in cancer survival, treatable mortality and life expectancy.\nThis situation was never inevitable or necessary. It was never a question of sustainability, or of efficiency, both of which have deteriorated — the NHS budget has risen, but budgets are eaten up by profit-extraction and fragmentation and deficits (compared to arbitrary budgets) are now widespread among NHS trusts.\nCorporations — often the same ones — have been driving policy and legislative changes on both sides of the Atlantic to the detriment of the NHS and the people who depend on it and those who work in it.\nWithout that legislative and policy context, and without facing down the quiet imposition of ACOs/ICSs on a false prospectus, activists and advocates cannot properly grasp or counter the substitution of skilled clinicians for individuals carrying out complex procedures and processes with just two years’ cursory training.\nDespite the government’s narratives claiming the roles were introduced, and are being expanded, to help doctors, the reason the “evidence” doesn’t make sense within a public service ethos is simply — it was never about public service.\nJust like austerity, the high-level choices made in medical provision are all political. Because we know this is an actual policy, stated in documents but never in public discourse, it falls to civil society and the defenders of our NHS to consistently call out the fact the government, in particular NHS England, is putting a lot of money into recruiting and incentivising undertrained, ultimately cheaper staff — not to provide the best healthcare, since clearly they cannot, but to meet business requirements.\nThis is a stark contrast to how the government is driving out fully trained but exhausted professionals and encouraging the departure and/or blockage of the trained, overseas staff we continue to need.\nThe staffing crisis in the NHS was always about much more than just failing to recruit and retain skilled staff. It has always been about adopting what the former NHS England boss Lord Simon Stevens called more “flexible” models, instead of what he also called the “outdated” skilled staffing that we used to receive as a right, under the actual NHS we all loved and cared about.\nAnd, deeply worryingly, Labour’s health spokesman is echoing this same language of an outdated NHS that must “modernise or die.”\nIt’s high time for all of us, activists, advocates and campaigners alike to redouble our efforts to oppose the destruction of the NHS — and those who are driving and benefiting from it — for the political decision that it is. But to do that we have to change the public discourse, starting with our own.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

War itself is a crime.”\nThe international community must redouble its efforts to find a diplomatic solution that ensures peace and protects lives.\nI stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian community in Leicester and across the country, and I offer my services to any concerned members of the Ukrainian diaspora in Leicester.\nI also stand in solidarity with anti-war campaigners in Russia, Ukraine and across the world.\nThe Minsk-2 Agreement of 2014/15 and the original Budapest memorandum on security assurances signed at the 1994 conference of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), of which I am an alternate member, must be the basis for long-term security for the whole region.\nAs Noam Chomsky critiqued: “If Europe had a really independent role in world affairs it could be acting in such a way as to bring the Minsk-2 agreement into operation — that would probably resolve the crisis.”\nThere are many who are urging the British government to urgently and completely cleanse itself of all financial ties to Russian oligarchs.\nBut arguably, Britain is moving far too slowly to freeze the assets of Russian banks and oligarchs, risking asset flight.\nDespite warning after warning over recent years about the extent of dirty money in Britain, the government has been asleep at the wheel and has failed to act, leaving Britain as the destination of choice for kleptocrats who hide their wealth under our noses.\nIt should not have taken an invasion of Ukraine for the government to take action. Donors who have made money from Russia or have alleged links to the Putin regime have given £1.93 million to either the Conservative Party or individual Conservative associations since Boris Johnson took power in July 2019.\nAfter more than a decade of inaction, the influence of corrupt money must now be extricated from Britain.\nWhile there is no equivocating about Putin’s total responsibility for this catastrophe, the British government must remember our country’s own complicity in the current crisis — which goes beyond its acceptance of dirty money.\nThe former MI6 chief, Sir Richard Dearlove, expressed his regret in 2018 for our security services’ role in Putin’s rise to power.\nIn the decade before the Russian arms embargo was introduced in 2014, Putin’s Russia has also received £44m worth of British arms, including ammunition, sniper rifle components and gun silencers.\nYet despite the embargo of 2014, according to data compiled by Campaign Against Arms Trade, British companies were granted 30 licences to export £3.7m worth of goods classed as “for military purposes to Russia” between 2014 and 30 September 2021, when data was last released.\nThis included £1.4m worth of components for military aircraft, helicopters or drones, and £1.2m of ammunition. Britain must ensure that this moment is a turning point and ends the sale of arms across the world.\nUkraine is under fire and people are fleeing war. Yet the Home Office is still applying normal visa restrictions such as on salaries, English language facility and only close relatives.\nGovernment ministers are telling refugees to apply for visas designed for fruit-pickers. This isn’t solidarity with Ukraine, it is immoral.\nThe government must urgently provide a simple sanctuary route to Britain for all who need it. The Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary must co-ordinate with the UN and with neighbouring countries to offer urgent humanitarian assistance to those crossing the border, and to ensure they can leave as safely as possible.\nThe British government must also provide safe passage and refuge for displaced people, refugees and asylum-seekers arriving from Ukraine as well as all theatres of conflict across the globe.\nThere are also deeply worrying reports that thousands of African immigrants joining Ukrainians trying to flee the country have faced red tape, racist abuse and discrimination at the border.\nThe international community must ensure that there is absolutely no discrimination between Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians and Europeans and non-Europeans.\nEverybody is fleeing from the same appalling invasion, and everybody’s life must be valued equally.\nSadly, this inequality is reflected in how this catastrophe has been reported. In a statement over the weekend, the Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association condemned what it described as the “orientalist and racist” news coverage, in particular regarding how journalists have compared the conflict in Ukraine to those in the Middle East, which it says “ascribes more importance to some victims of war over others.”\nIn reporting on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the abhorrent invasion has been portrayed as being inflicted on people who are less deserving of the horrors of war due to their geographical location and the colour of their skin.\nFor instance, Daniel Hannan wrote in the Telegraph that Ukrainians “seem so like us. That is what makes it so shocking. War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations. It can happen to anyone.”\nThis implies that war is OK as long as it happens in non-European countries. Similarly, a senior foreign correspondent for CBS News, Charlie D’Agata, claimed that the attack on Ukraine cannot be compared to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because the eastern European country is more “civilised.”\n“This isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades,” he said. “This is a relatively civilised, relatively European — I have to choose those words carefully, too — city where you wouldn’t expect that, or hope that it’s going to happen.”\nThese comments reflect a grim, colonial-inspired worldview between the civilised West and uncivilised “others.”\nAl Jazeera English was also forced to apologise after presenter Peter Dobbie said during a Sunday broadcast: “What’s compelling is looking at them [Ukrainians], the way they are dressed. These are prosperous, middle-class people. These are not obviously refugees trying to get away from the Middle East […] or North Africa. They look like any European family that you’d live next door to.”\nEchoing this: “We are in the 21st century, we are in a European city, and we have cruise missile fire as though we were in Iraq or Afghanistan, can you imagine!” a commentator on BFM TV, France’s leading news channel, said during a live broadcast.\nOn the same channel, journalist Philippe Corbe said: “We’re not talking here about Syrians fleeing the bombing of the Syrian regime backed by Putin, we’re talking about Europeans leaving in cars that look like ours to save their lives.”\nThe stark contrast in these comments between how the suffering of different nationalities is reported could not be clearer.\nLucy Watson of ITV News said: “Now the unthinkable has happened to them, and this is not a developing, third world nation, this is Europe.”\nPerhaps most shocking of all, NBC news correspondent Hallie Cobiella said: “To put it bluntly, these are not refugees from Syria, these are refugees from Ukraine […] They’re Christians, they’re white. They’re very similar [to us].”\nEchoing this explicit reference to race, Ukraine’s deputy chief prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze told the BBC: “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed.”\nIf we contrast this to the dehumanising language used to describe non-white refugees, asylum-seekers and victims of war — such as former PM David Cameron’s description of refugees as a “swarm” — a very worrying picture emerges about the inherent racism in how crises are reported, discussed and responded to.\nThis othering of non-white, non-European people, as identified in Edward Said’s famous 1978 book Orientalism, serves to diminish the suffering of people across the world.\nWe must oppose the unjustifiable trauma of people in Ukraine as vehemently as we do the suffering of victims of conflict in Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and every country suffering from the evil of war.\nThe media class, and the British government, must recognise that every theatre of conflict is deserving of both our solidarity and our compassion.\nTherefore, Britain must not only rapidly extend its support for people fleeing Ukraine — but also abandon its unbelievably callous refugee and asylum policy, starting by ripping up the Nationalities and Borders Bill.\nAbove all else, we must ensure that this awful moment is a turning point in how Britain responds to conflicts — wherever they occur.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_it-is-finally-time-to-take-legal-action-against-israel-at-the-highest-level/content_305.html": "It is finally time to take legal action against Israel at the highest level\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nSouth Africa is right to invoke the Genocide Convention against Israel at the Hague, other countries should now support and follow, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST WEEK, South Africa filed an application with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) instituting proceedings against Israel for “genocidal acts” against Palestinians in Gaza. It is right to do so, both morally and legally.\nIn analysing the case, it is worth clearing up a common confusion about whether Israel is subject to the International Court of Justice. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes individual war crimes, the International Court of Justice is “the principal judicial organ of the UN… established by the UN charter in June 1945.”\nLike any other UN member state, Israel is subject to its jurisdiction. The court consists of fifteen judges elected by the general assembly and the security council of the UN, who will decide the case.\nSouth Africa’s case alleges that Israel has committed genocide both by commission and omission. “Acts and omissions by Israel… are genocidal in character, as they are committed with the requisite specific intent… to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnic group.”\nIt continues: “The conduct of Israel — through its State organs, State agents, and other persons and entities acting on its instructions or under its direction, control or influence — in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, is in violation of its obligations under the Genocide Convention.”\nThe key to the case is the issue of intent, which has previously been very difficult to prove as those intent on committing genocide do not typically announce their intention to do so.\nHowever, perhaps as a result of its sense of impunity stemming from the effective carte blanche support it has enjoyed for decades from the US and Britain, senior figures from the Israeli regime have been anything but reticent about their intentions, even if the Western media outside Israel have been reticent about reporting it.\nIsraeli minister Avi Dichter told Israel’s Channel 12 in November that Israel would inflict “Gaza’s Nakba” — the Arabic word for “catastrophe” that refers to the violent expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians in 1948 and the killing of thousands, including outright massacres.\nA week earlier, Dichter’s ministerial colleague Amihai Eliyahu said that one possible resolution for the war was to “flatten Gaza” by dropping a nuclear bomb on it.\nIn October, Israeli President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel regards collective punishment of the people of Gaza — a war crime — as justified, saying: “There are no innocent civilians in Gaza.”\nAnd Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu made his and his government’s intentions perfectly clear when he said that Palestinians are “Amalek” — referring to a people group that Israel exterminated entirely in the biblical account.\nAnd now, after beginning as a leaked Ministry of Intelligence document, plans to force the entire population of Gaza across the border into “tent cities” in the Egyptian desert, or even further away to any other nation, are being floated openly by government figures — and even boasted about by Netanyahu, under the disgraceful euphemism of “voluntary migration.”\nAnd of course, Israel’s military actions, which, arguably, have killed more than 30,000 Palestinian civilians in Gaza so far, around 70 per cent of them women and children, support the allegation of genocide.\nThis is even more so now, as according to the UN, 40 per cent of civilians in Gaza are on the brink of famine. “Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part” are also included in the definition of genocide.\nSenior military figures have talked openly about creating the conditions for disease to further reduce the population and the World Health Organisation has predicted that disease will kill more people in Gaza than Israel’s bombs, bullets and missiles.\nGenocide by omission is also alleged by South Africa, that Israel is failing to prosecute those who incite genocide — and seems equally clear cut.\nIsraeli analyst Eliyahu Yossian, who works for the government-sponsored think tank the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), gave what can only be described as a horrifying interview to Israeli television last month that categorised women, babies, even expectant mothers, as the “enemy.”\nYossian told his host that he believed Israel needed to flatten Gaza “to kill the largest number possible,” because “the woman there is the enemy, the baby there is an enemy and the first-grader there is an enemy… the pregnant woman is an enemy.”\nYossian is not an outlier. Channel 14 presenter Shai Golden ranted: “We are coming to Gaza, we are coming to Lebanon, we are coming to Iran. Can you imagine how many of you we are going to kill and slaughter?”\nAnd Israeli state-owned TV station KAN broadcast a video showing a choir of children singing about the “annihilation” of Gaza: “In another year there will be nothing there… another year and we will annihilate everyone.”\nThese are far from isolated incidents. Yet the Israeli government has taken no action against anyone for inciting genocide.\nSo clear-cut is the evidence that UN officials and other legal and historical experts on genocide have described Israel’s behaviour as a “textbook case,” such as Craig Mokhiber, who resigned as director of the UN’s human rights office in New York because of the UN’s lack of effective action.\nMokhiber, who worked for the UN through the genocides against the Tutsis, Bosnian Muslims, the Yazidi and the Rohingya, condemned the “impunity” Israel was given despite its “successive waves of murder and persecution against the Palestinians throughout the life of the UN.”\nThe UN itself has categorised what Israel is doing as genocide. The UN’s human rights office issued a statement noting that its experts considered they have seen ample “evidence of increasing genocidal incitement, overt intent to ‘destroy the Palestinian people under occupation,’ loud calls for a ‘second Nakba’ in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, and the use of powerful weaponry with inherently indiscriminate impacts, resulting in a colossal death toll and destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure.”\nSouth Africa, of course, is well placed to assess the actions of a regime that has been categorised, by senior UN figures and human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as operating a system of apartheid.\nThe solidarity of leading South Africans with the people of Palestine and their opposition to Israel’s occupation and oppression go back decades. Such figures as Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Jewish former ANC MP Andrew Feinstein have been absolutely unequivocal in their condemnation of Israel’s conduct and their support for Palestinian self-determination.\nAnd South Africa knows also that peace after such conduct can only come through truth and reconciliation, that former enemies can and must come together to break the cycle of violence if there is to be any hope of peace for either side.\nSouth Africa is absolutely right to bring this case to the International Court of Justice. It brings yet more shame on the political leadership and governments of Britain and US that they not only have failed to do the same but are providing military support and arms to Israel against the Palestinians, killing tens of thousands and maiming many tens of thousands more.\nThe International Court of Justice could charge Israel with genocide in Gaza. The first hearing for South Africa’s claim is scheduled to take place next week, it’s not too late for the other nation states to support the claim or likewise, invoke the same. Our global movement must act to ensure they do. It could be a turning point in global relations. Watch this space.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-hostility-to-refugees-and-asylum-seekers-must-end/content_785.html": "The hostility to refugees and asylum-seekers must end\nBy Claudia Webbe\nThe government has no plan for Afghans it deliberately left behind, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIn 2012, Dominic Raab co-authored a fanatically right-wing book entitled Britannia Unchained — a blueprint for Thatcherism on steroids that accused British workers of being “among the worst idlers in the world” and argued that “too many people in Britain prefer a lie-in to hard work.”\nYet last week, during the foreign affairs committee evidence session on Britain’s catastrophic handling of the Kabul evacuation, Raab was forced to defend his decision to stay on holiday while hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people in Afghanistan required his assistance.\nIn the end, he admitted that he should have left the beach earlier.\nThe evidence session laid bare the failure of the Foreign Secretary, who was missing in action at the crucial moment despite having 18 months to prepare for the evacuation.\nSimply put, he did not care because his Tory government does not care about refugees and asylum-seekers — despite Britain’s historic and contemporary complicity in the current crisis in Afghanistan.\nThat’s why I asked him to consider his position and resign.\nThe Foreign Secretary’s testimony revealed that his government left British nationals behind because of the Tory government’s fundamental problem with refugees and asylum-seekers.\nIt saw British nationals with significant family networks as a problem, and rather than evacuate first and process later in a safe country, it chose to leave them behind because their family members could not be verified, or Britain could not process the visa clearance due to unacceptably slow administration rates.\nThis is exactly why I urged the government to consider introducing an “arrive first, process later” policy to address this crisis with the urgency it demands.\nInstead, due to their ideological commitment to marginalising refugees and asylum-seekers, the British government refused to give status to the families of British nationals or the families of those Afghan nationals who had served Britain or are at particular risk.\nThis cruelty had life-or-death consequences on the ground. The miserly processing of claims led to family members of British nationals being given the choice at Kabul airport to stay or just take their significant other with them — thus leaving behind all other family members at the mercy of Taliban reprisals.\nThe Tories’ refusal to adopt a more generous asylum policy has left behind hundreds of British nationals and their dependants; many thousands of Afghans who had worked for Britain and supported allied forces; female politicians and journalists; human rights activists and anyone who worked for causes that are despised by the Taliban.\nThe Foreign Secretary could not even say how many people are now in danger of brutal reprisal.\nOver the weekend, it emerged that officials from Raab’s department had failed to read thousands of emails from MPs and charities detailing urgent cases of Afghans trying to escape from Kabul.\nMy team and I have been working hard to help my constituents in Leicester East and their Afghan family members trapped in Afghanistan who fear for their lives.\nYet the government failed to deliver the resources to open and action our correspondence.\nRather than accept responsibility, the Foreign Secretary scrambled for excuses.\nHe had the gall to criticise “buckpassing briefers” — yet also suggested that failures in military intelligence had meant that the West had been caught off guard by the pace of the Taliban power grab in Afghanistan.\nIn addition, he pointed the finger of blame at the Home Office and Ministry of Defence for the failure to process urgent correspondence.\nIt is true that the communication in the three-pronged processing approach between the Foreign, Home and Defence departments has been appalling.\nYet this only raises further questions about the competence of this government — appointed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson — which refused to treat the evacuation of Kabul with the urgency it demanded.\nThe lack of a clear plan was a disgraceful dereliction of duty.\nOne of many examples of the government’s failures is its refusal to introduce specific protections for religious minorities.\nI wrote to the government urging it to provide ring-fenced assistance to extract the 270 Sikhs and Hindus who were trapped in the Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Kabul.\nHistorically, minority groups in Afghanistan, including Hindus and Sikhs, have been targeted under Taliban rule.\nTheir population has declined significantly since the 1980s, from hundreds of thousands to the low hundreds.\nThe government should have obtained an approved route for this group of religious minority members and secured escorted access to the airport and extraction out of Afghanistan.\nYet it failed to do so, and refused to support all minorities and at-risk communities during this crisis.\nThe government now must redouble its efforts to ensure the safe passage out of Afghanistan for all those at risk of being targeted by the Taliban or otherwise at risk of persecution.\nIt must provide support to human rights defenders, trade unionists and journalists who remain in Afghanistan; in particular those who are women or from religious or ethnic minority backgrounds.\nIt is especially vital that we support people at particularly heightened risk and their family members to reach a place of safety, including Britain.\nBritain must also share responsibility with Pakistan and Iran, which host the great majority of the world’s Afghan refugees and support neighbouring countries to ensure their borders remain open to people fleeing the Afghanistan crisis.\nBritain must not only stop all forced returns and deportations to Afghanistan but also ensure that people who clearly cannot safely return there are provided with protection here and not merely left in limbo unable to find work and rebuild their lives.\nThey must be given status now. To that end, the government should facilitate the opportunity for British Afghans, Afghan refugees and other Afghans in Britain to sponsor and support their family members to join them here.\nGiven the widespread war crimes by coalition forces that were unearthed by Julian Assange, it is incumbent on British government to work with its international partners to promptly establish a UN fact-finding mission into all allegations of crimes under international law, human rights violations and abuses by all parties in Afghanistan — including collecting and preserving all evidence for future prosecutions.\nAbove all else, the government must now urgently rethink its asylum policy — as crystallised in its Nationality and Borders Bill — which intentionally sets out to penalise and exclude the relatively small number of refugees, including from Afghanistan, who flee to Britain without a visa to seek asylum because no such visa is available to them.\nFinally, this government must follow the realisation laid out by President Joe Biden’s recent speech which called for an end to US interventionist wars across the world.\nI have taken issue with many things that have happened under Biden’s watch, especially the fact that a recent retaliatory drone strike, in response to Isis-K’s Kabul airport terrorist attack, killed seven Afghan children.\nYet the withdrawal from neoimperial adventures is a brave policy shift that is deserving, not only of our full support, but of a similar recognition from the British government.\nIt is time that the fantasies born from a hangover of the British empire are abandoned for good.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

However, America and Britain continue to bomb Yemeni cities and terrorize safe civilians without any legal justification at all other than protecting the Israeli trade and economy.”\nIn the letter, the parliament speaker pointed out what Webbe pointed out in her article that Yemen has been subjected to bombing for ten years by the Saudi-Emirati coalition with American-British support, logistical and intelligence participation, indicating that when Yemen approaches creating an opportunity for peace, America and Britain’s desire to bomb Yemen is renewed to punish Yemenis because they are carrying out their humanitarian, moral and religious duty towards the oppressed Palestinians.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_a-fairer-future-will-be-one-in-which-black-history-month-will-no-longer-be-necessary/content_571.html": "A fairer future will be one in which Black History Month will no longer be necessary\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nLet us pledge to continue the generational struggle for full racial equality, says CLAUDIA WEBBE\nA STARK reminder of the importance of Black History Month was delivered the day before it began.\nLast week, during the shambolic first US presidential debate, Donald Trump repeatedly failed to condemn white supremacists.\nHe even implied that the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, should “stand by” to monitor the protests which have sprung up against racist police brutality.\nSadly, this normalised tolerance for racism extends to Britain. In the same week as Trump’s latest racist comment, it was reported that Home Secretary Priti Patel had proposed processing people seeking asylum in Britain on Ascension Island — which is 7,109 kilometres away from Britain. This is an inhumane, racist proposition.\nIt was also recently revealed that the 18-month-long Windrush compensation scheme has seen the Home Office pay out just £1.3 million across 168 cases — which accounts for just 11 per cent of claims lodged since April 2019.\nThe Windrush scandal was an unacceptable travesty, which denied black British residents their basic legal rights.\nThe official inquiry into the scandal concluded that it was caused by institutional failures to understand race and racism.\nIf recent events are anything to go by, the government has learnt no lessons from this scandal.\nAcross the world, racism and the far right are on the rise. It has never been more important for us to learn from the history of racial oppression and to end the injustices that exist to this day.\nDuring the Black Lives Matter movement, we’ve rightly seen renewed calls for our schools to teach the true brutal history of the British empire and the legacy of imperialism, colonialism and racism which continue today to have a generational impact.\nAs we reflect on the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of brutal police killings, it is crucial to recognise that Britain has been central to the historical subjugation of African-Americans.\nIt is estimated that, until the Abolition of Slavery Act in 1833, Britain transported some 3.1 million Africans, around 25 per cent of all slaves, to its colonies in the Caribbean, North America and elsewhere.\nAnd when the British empire did abolish slavery in 1807, it provided 46,000 slave-owners — among them the ancestors of David Cameron, George Orwell and Graham Greene — with today’s equivalent of £17 billion.\nThe British government only paid off its obligations to former slave-owning families and organisations in 2015.\nUntil then, black British taxpayers are amongst those who have been paying to compensate those that imprisoned our ancestors.\nPresent-day global inequalities remain permanently shaped by the horrors of extractive colonialism and racialised subordination.\nThis Black History Month, former colonial powers must begin to recognise and repair the historical damage upon which their prosperity was built.\nOne example is the unacceptable instances of appalling murder and violence at the hands of the British state that have been erased from present-day memory of empire.\nNowhere is this clearer than in Kenya. There is a collective amnesia in Britain regarding British torture camps in 1950s Kenya, where members of the Kikuyu tribe were systematically tortured, starved, beaten, mistreated and raped, as well as the massacre of the Sotik people where 1,800 men, women and children were murdered in a colonial land-grab.\nAcross Kenya, the rest of Africa and other regions forced to endure the injustice of colonialism, indigenous communities were systematically alienated from their rightful lands.\nThis historical injustice laid the groundwork for decades of uneven development and corporate extraction.\nYet these massacres have been airbrushed from British history. There has never been any form of apology, and no reparations ever offered for acts of historic genocide, including the Jallianwala Bagh (Amritsar) Massacre of 1919, where over 2,000 people were shot in a single afternoon.\nThe brutality of modern racism in Britain cannot be separated from this history.\nThis perverse legacy continues to affect us in all walks of life, from police use of force to unfair immigration detentions to the disproportionate number of black children who go to bed hungry.\nThe crucial question facing us this Black History Month is what does it mean to transform Black Lives Matter from a crucial slogan to a reality of daily life?\nThis means reforming Britain’s racist criminal justice system.\nThis means justice for the victims of racialised state violence, including Grenfell Tower and the Windrush Generation.\nIt means that when a black person dies in police custody — as they disproportionately do — the incident is thoroughly investigated and the police involved face justice.\nIt means transforming our British education system to teach the true and enduring history of colonialism, imperialism and the transatlantic slave trade.\nIt means an end to racist policies like no recourse to public funds and the hostile environment.\nUltimately, it means an end to neoliberal capitalism, which enshrines racial inequality at home and abroad.\nThis Black History Month let us pledge to continue the generational struggle for full racial equality.\nLet us resolve for our history to be taught all year round. And let us fight for a fairer future in which this important month will no longer be necessary.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Along with its attacks on Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, Israel is also attacking Lebanon, we have seen attacks on Syria, Iraq and Iran. We cannot afford an all-out war in the Middle East with armed nuclear powers involved: the stakes are far too high.\n“Every MP who failed to vote for a ceasefire washed their hands of the conflict and sided with the powerful.\n“Every leader who fails to champion the ruling of the ICJ is washing their hands of the conflict and siding with the powerful.\n“And now the political class of the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland who have withdrawn their funding to UNRWA have deepened the genocide. They are not only washing their hands and siding with the powerful, they are complicit in what is happening.”\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was deeply poignant to watch South Africa present its genocide case against Israel at the Hague.\n“The response now to the allegations against 12 members of UNRWA — of withdrawing funding by Britain, by the US, by a number of other countries — is beyond disgusting,” he continued.\n“UNRWA has already had over 100 members of its staff killed.\n“I know the dedication of their teams and their staff: they fed and educated Palestinian people for nearly four decades. So we have to demand the British government to restore its funding.\n“Claudia and I will be doing that in Parliament tomorrow — but we also have to demand governments around the world now step up to the plate and provide the resources that UNRWA desperately needs in order to help people out of this crisis.”\nLeicester East MP Claudia Webbe said: “Israel’s indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, complete destruction of civilian infrastructure and the forceful transfer of 1.9 million to the south [of Gaza] amounts to ethnic cleansing.\n“The massacre and slaughter of civilians is on an industrial scale.”\nOn Saturday UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said the decision by countries to suspend funding was shocking and immensely irresponsible. He said that UNRWA had ordered an investigation after Israel provided information alleging several employees played a role in Hamas’s assault.\nActivist group Health Workers for Palestine said it would protest against the“disgusting decision by our British government and other Western governments” to cut funding to UNRWA outside Downing Street as the Morning Star went to press today.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Instead, it is enabling them, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nFOR years now, the appalling exploitation of garment workers in Leicester has been well known, with manipulation, pressure and harassment endemic alongside excessive hours, terrible working conditions and pay as low as £3.50 an hour.\nThis has been largely ignored at both national and local levels, a situation that contributes to terrible hardship in my constituency of Leicester East, where more than four in 10 children live in poverty. I and others have been pushing for urgent legislation to bring this industry under control and make brands accountable for their actions, but the situation is getting worse, not better.\nThe abuse and exploitation of garment workers by a corrupt and greedy fast fashion industry is not, of course, limited to Leicester. The fashion sector is home to some of the worst excesses of corporate capitalism.\nIn an industry worth $1.5 trillion annually, poverty pay and workplace abuse are the global norm, with brands and retailers doing little more than pay lip service to the idea of improving their conduct while workers, mostly women, and their families continue to suffer and in many cases to die, like the 1,134 killed in the Rana Plaza building collapse and the 117 or more in the Tazreen factory fire, with many more injured.\nIn the absence of a Garment Trade Adjudicator or Fashion Watchdog, Britain should not be enabling the exploiters, let alone welcoming more. In Leicester East fashion giant Boohoo, whose unethical procurement practices were exposed in a 2020 BBC Panorama documentary, has closed the “flagship” Thurmaston Lane manufacturing site, which it supposedly set up only in 2022 in my constituency of Leicester East to show it had changed its ways, and is now selling the building.\nA recent new Panorama programme revealed the same malpractice continuing unchecked and said that the company was using Thurmaston Lane as a front for cheap imports that it was re-labelling as “made in the UK,” a practice that workers had long complained to me about. Boohoo claimed that the BBC had come across “an isolated incident” caused by “a misinterpretation of the labelling rules” and that its improvements had “driven the industry forward.”\nThe company reportedly paid £3 million for the site, plus construction and refurbishment costs — costs that the firm will be able to write off against its profits while its former workforce struggles to find new work.\nThe firm appears to be escaping any fall-out from its behaviour and its failure to change its practices. A 2023 Bath University study, “What happened after the Boohoo scandal?,” which found that Boohoo had made only cosmetic “face-saving” changes, interviewed manufacturers and workers. One former supplier told the university:\n“Companies like Boohoo can escape the consequences even after being exposed. They fail to pay a sustainable amount that will enable manufacturers to provide fair wages. Consequently, well-intentioned exposes, such as the Boohoo scandal, do not truly assign responsibility for those left behind, for those who bear the brunt of such industry-altering events. Brands merely shift their production to locations where cheap labour is readily available.”\nBoohoo’s decision to close Thurmaston Lane and move its procurement of contracts elsewhere has put thousands of Leicester women, mostly South Asian, in immense difficulties during the “cost-of-living crisis,” while allowing Boohoo to distance itself from the allegations of malpractice. According to its most recently published supply chain list, Boohoo is buying the vast majority of its items outside Britain, most notably in China, Turkey, India and Pakistan.\nThe “close and move” tactic is symptomatic of the inherently exploitative nature of the fashion industry generally and fast fashion in particular — an industry that can only make a profit if clothes are dirt cheap, volumes are high and workers are paid next to nothing.\nBrands and retailers chase the lowest cost, either switching suppliers or using the threat of a switch to drive down their buying cost, often to a level below the sustainable cost of production. Exploitation and misery are sewn into every fast-fashion garment.\nAs always, it is the workers and their families who suffer the results of this race to the bottom. Around 94 million people globally work in garment production, most of them in harsh, unsafe workplaces for poverty wages and inhumane hours.\nThe wider issues with the “fast fashion” industry are also immense, especially for the environment. In an industry that considers every week a new fashion “season” — Boohoo lists over 100 new items on its website every day, according to ethicalconsumer.org — garments have to be produced cheaply because so many of them are thrown away unsold or are sold off for peanuts to people who will only wear them once or twice.\n80-100 billion new garments are made globally every year. 87 per cent of them will not be recycled, instead being incinerated or dumped into landfills — around 92m tonnes annually. In the US alone, manufacturers and retailers burn or bury 13m tons (11.8m tonnes) of unsold garments every year, because the industry overproduces fashion lines by 30-40 per cent and trends are driven to change so quickly to fuel demand.\nBritain, for its part, dumps around 360,000 tonnes of clothes that are still wearable into landfill each year — a rate of around 10,000 items every five minutes according to Keep Britain Tidy. The average item of clothing is worn only 10 times, with many people considering a garment “old” after two or three times.\nLandfills and incineration are far from the only impacts of fast fashion on our environment. 35 per cent of ocean plastics are estimated to come from the washing of polyester clothing, cotton production leads to around a quarter of global pesticide use and the fashion industry is on track to create more than a quarter of global emissions within a couple of decades.\nAgainst such a backdrop, any reasonable government would be clamping down on the excesses, malpractice and corruption of an industry that can only exist through exploitation, corner-cutting and poverty pay. Instead, the British government is actively enabling it.\nIn February, US media reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission was preparing to block a US stock exchange listing by Chinese-Singaporean super-fast fashion giant Shein, amid concerns about the company’s reporting practices and its alleged use of modern slavery.\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt responded to this by meeting Shein’s chief executive to try to lure him to list in London instead, with the Treasury boasting, “We have developed reforms to boost Britain as a destination for IPOs, including making it easier for companies to list more quickly.”\nShein’s churning-out of new lines dwarfs even that of Boohoo — reportedly up to 10,000 a day — and its procurement practices are allegedly as bad or worse.\nShein has been accused of falsifying reports of forced or underpaid labour of its supplier factories.\nThere is no indication that these concerns gave Hunt pause for thought before he rushed to exploit US hesitation and tempt Shein to list on the Stock Exchange — unsurprising, given the Conservatives’ contempt for human rights and the planet, amply demonstrated in attacks on our freedoms and the refusal to act against businesses that pollute our air and waterways.\nIn a country where exploitative fast fashion brands and retailers are responsible for some of the worst employment practices and environmental damage, the government needs to be moving quickly to regulate this industry to protect workers and the environment, not changing rules and abandoning principles to enable the exploiters and polluters. The cry from garment workers in Leicester and across the global South, for decent work and decent pay, must not go unheard. Our movement must rise in solidarity.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

Its Asian population first became well established after 20,000 people settled in the East Midlands manufacturing city after expulsion from Uganda in 1972.\nClaudia Webbe, right, the independent MP for Leicester East, said: “This data reinforces the identity of our community. It is what makes Leicester special – we are richer for this vibrant exchange of cultures.”\nRiaz Ravat, deputy director of the city’s St Philip’s Centre, said: “Leicester has evolved over many years and now has a global outlook. We should be proud of this.” Minority ethnic people also make up more than half the population in Luton (54.8%) and Birmingham (51.4%).\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_mp-spectre-of-violence-blights-lives-of-women/content_916.html": "MP: Spectre of violence blights lives of women\nA Leicester MP has voiced her condemnation of violence against women after a woman was thought to have been murdered in London last week.\nLeicester East MP, Claudia Webbe, told LeicestershireLive there is a “spectre of violence” in our country which “blights the lives of girls and women”.\nThis comes after Sabina Nessa, a 28-year-old teacher, was killed while walking to meet a friend at a London bar on Friday night.\nHer body was found near a community centre in Kidbrooke Park Road, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, on Saturday, according to the Metropolitan Police.\nMs Webbe said: “The murder of Sabina Nessa, who was killed as she walked through a park to meet her friends, is utterly heart-breaking. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones.\n“This violence has a trickle-down effect on the safety and wellbeing of women, who are forced to endure the constant threat of potential male violence. From parks and bus stops to our local high streets, girls and young women across the UK are facing appalling, misogynistic harassment every day.\n“This spectre of violence blights the lives of girls and women, affecting their mental health, self-esteem, sense of safety and impinges on their right to equal access to public space.\n“As we mourn Sabina, we must redouble our efforts to end the scourge of gendered violence and to build a future free of misogyny, hate crimes and the unacceptable risk that women currently face.”\nMs Webbe also took to Twitter to add her voice to those calling for an end to these crimes, saying Ms Nessa’s death was another reminder of the violence and fear faced by women everyday.\nShe said: “Women should not have to fear for their safety, walking alone at night. Sabina Nessa did not make it home.\n“Her [alleged] murder is a reminder of how our lives are controlled daily – violence against women must end.”\nA man in his forties was arrested in connection to the killing, but later released pending further investigation.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Kahn, has also addressed this cycle of violence, labelling it an ‘epidemic’.\nHe said on ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Between last year’s International Women’s Day and this year’s International Women’s Day, 180 women were killed at the hands of men across the country.\n“We do have an epidemic when it comes to violence against women and girls. I think us men have got to be allies in addressing this issue.”\nThe investigation into Sabina Nessa’s death is ongoing with the Metropolitan police asking anyone with information to contact them.\nEarlier this month, a new online tool that allows women and girls to anonymously flag areas of the country that they feel unsafe in launched in the UK.\nThe StreetSafe tool from the Home office is part of a three-month national pilot by the Home Office and women and girls in Leicestershire are being urged to use it to influence policing in the future.\nLeicestershire’s Police and Crime Commissioner Rupert Matthews welcomed the launch, saying he “wholeheartedly endorsed” the Government’s strategy to tackle violence against women and girls.\nHowever, Ms Webbe said the Government should be doing more.\n“The government must do much more to protect women and girls. Yet the fact that their flagship police bill introduced longer sentences for damaging a statue than sexually assaulting a woman reveals how utterly unserious they are about ending the perpetual threat that women face.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_divide-rule/content_530.html": "Divide and Rule\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Andrew Sabisky affair is likely to be only the first of many Tory racism scandals as the new government sets about dividing our communities in the interests of the rich, argues Claudia Webbe.\n”Let’s get out and get on with it. Let’s unite this country… Let’s get Brexit done. But first, my friends, let’s get breakfast done.”\nThese words, from Boris Johnson’s victory speech the morning after the devastating general election, demonstrate the Prime Minister’s disingenuous approach to healing the country. A glib call for unity, followed immediately by a cringe-worthy pun.\nThis was further proof, if any were needed, that Johnson’s premiership would never be serious about bringing people together or soothing legitimate concerns about the Prime Minister’s own history of racist and offensive comments.\nIt took barely two months for Number 10 to reveal its tolerance for racism and divisiveness. Andrew Sabisky, a 27-year-old protégé of controversial senior Johnson advisor Dominic Cummings, was hired by Downing Street earlier this year after Cummings advertised a job for “misfits and weirdos.” This week, a long history of Sabisky’s abhorrently racist, sexist and classist views were unearthed.\nChief amongst these were his endorsement of eugenics, the disgusting, unproven pseudo-science which links human traits to ethnicity, which has historically been used to justify violent, racist imperialism and the atrocities of Nazi Germany. Sabisky falsely suggested that black people on average have lower IQs than white people and wrote that “there are excellent reasons to think the very real racial differences in intelligence are significantly – even mostly – genetic in origin.”\nHe also endorsed enforced contraception “to get around the problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass,” and wrote that people on benefits “tend to be less conscientious and agreeable” and should therefore have less children than working people with more “pro-social personalities.” He also boasted that “I am always straight up in saying that women’s sport is more comparable to the Paralympics than it is to men’s.”\nShockingly, this is not an exhaustive list of Sabisky’s appalling views. Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer about how a person with such vile opinions was ever able to work in Number 10.\nAs a black, working-class woman representing the incredibly diverse constituency of Leicester East, I am gravely concerned that the Tories are following Donald Trump’s divisive, racist agenda as a template for government.\n49 percent of our city’s population are from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background, the largest proportion in England and Wales, and over a third of our residents were born outside the UK. Most Leicester schoolchildren have a BAME background and half of all primary school children in the city speak another language at home, compared to just sixteen percent nationally. We are home to 240 faith groups across fourteen different faiths, and our residents hail from over 50 countries across the globe.\nI am incredibly proud to have been born and bred in such a wonderfully diverse city. That’s why I am appalled by the government’s willingness to divide our communities based on the colour of our skin and other immutable characteristics. I know only too well the hurt that my constituents will feel after the government tried to legitimise the dehumanisation and marginalisation of BAME communities.\nJohnson has pointedly refused to condemn Sabisky’s views, and his press officer attempted to defend the indefensible by standing by the disgraced advisor. A Downing Street spokesperson refused to answer more than thirty questions on whether Boris Johnson agreed with Sabisky’s views, by simply repeating that: “the Prime Minister’s views are well publicised and well documented.”\nIf this was an attempt to exonerate the PM from any accusation of impropriety, it won’t work. Boris Johnson’s own racist, misogynist, homophobic, Islamophobic, antisemitic and classist views are, indeed, ‘publicised and well documented.’\nThis is a Prime Minister who wrote in 2005 that it was only “natural” for the public to fear Islam. Who in 2018 compared Muslim women who wear burqas to “letter boxes” and bank robbers. Who has referred to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles.” Who has called gay men “tank-topped bumboys.” Who called working-class men “drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless and hopeless.”\nIt is a Prime Minister who said children of working mothers are “ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate,” and advised male colleagues to “pat [a female colleague] on the bottom and send her on her way.” Who wrote a book when he was a shadow Conservative minister invoking some of the oldest and most pernicious antisemitic stereotypes and whilst editor of the Spectator promoted anti-Jewish hatred.\nBut the Prime Minister is not attempting to diffuse these scandals. He has never apologised for his disgraceful comments. On Tuesday morning, Cummings dismissed those concerned about Sabisky as “political pundits who don’t know what they are talking about.” What Johnson and Cummings are attempting to do, despite the Prime Minister’s empty words the day after the election, is divide our communities so that they can continue to govern in the interest of the super-rich and big corporations.\nThe government’s acceleration of structural and institutionalised racism is of grave concern for my constituents in Leicester and for all of us who oppose injustice and inequality. Last week, Boris Johnson’s said that he “bitterly regretted” the court decision that stopped twenty-five more people from being deported to Jamaica because they had not had access to legal advice – a case with chilling similarity to the Windrush scandal.\nA few days later he appointed a new Attorney General, Suella Braverman MP, who wants to ‘take back control’ from British courts. What we are seeing is a hard-right Tory administration trying to centralise power so they can trample over basic human rights.\nAt a time when hate crime has more than doubled since 2013, it has never been more important for those of us on the left to bring our communities together. As socialists, we must oppose any attempt to divide people based on the colour of their skin, where they come from, who they love or which God they pray to.\nWith a government gleefully embracing racist culture wars and the politics of division, it is up to all of us, in Leicester East and across the country, to protect our people against those who wish to pit communities against each other.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Did you know that Leicester has just over 15% of Gujerati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu speakers?\nHere is the message of support from Jonathan Ashworth, Liz Kendall and I during the Leicester Lockdown with Gujerati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu subtitles whilst my team work to provide them in all the other required languages too.\nI wish all Muslims across Leicester and everywhere Eid Mubarak in celebration of Eid Al Adha.\nOur mosques cannot yet reopen. No visitors allowed to our homes or gardens. Our sacrifices today will be rewarded. Enjoy online social solidarity.\nWishing you a safe and peaceful Eid.\nWhen faced with a concrete opportunity to enshrine in law the safety of our most treasured public institution, the Conservatives sat on their hands.\nNow our NHS is at the mercy of US negotiators, who are heavily influenced by the multi- billion-dollar private healthcare industry which has a vested interest in carving up our health service for corporate gain.Yet there is an even clearer reason why we cannot trust the government when it says that the NHS is not for sale; they have been selling it off piece by piece for the best part of a decade.\nMy latest article for The Morning Star here.\nIt is appalling that the exploited labour of workers in Leicester East is helping to finance extravagant corporate salaries in the garment industry.\nThis is a microcosm of the stark inequality that exists in our society and across the world, and is proof that the obscene wealth of billionaires is built on the exploitation of the working class.\nWe all have a responsibility to ensure the clothes we wear are not stained with human misery.\nRead my article in the Leicester Mercury here.\nThis is a brave and necessary account of worker, exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry in the Eastern Eye.\nI have been approached by many residents of Leicester East who have bravely shared their firsthand experiences of exploitation. This includes employers seeking to avoid detection by pretending their factories are shut whilst workers file through back entrances; unwell employees being told to keep their symptoms secret from colleagues; false payslips which do not reflect real hours worked; being paid far less than the minimum wage and many more instances of cruel mistreatment.\nThe government must create a safe space for workers to come forward and through collective action be compensated for lost earnings and holiday pay and call out such outrageous employer malpractice, reverse the severe funding cuts to the Health and Safety Executive, create a single ethical licensing scheme and extend protections to all migrant workers.\nIt is appalling that the exploited labour of workers in Leicester East is helping to finance extravagant corporate salaries in the garment industry.\nThis is a microcosm of the stark inequality that exists in our society and across the world, and is proof that the obscene wealth of billionaires is built on the exploitation of the working class. We all have a responsibility to ensure the clothes we wear are not stained with human misery.\nThank you to the 40 parliamentarians, representing 7 political parties, who have signed this letter urging the Prime Minister to act.\nThe government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak in Leicester has left people anxious and confused.\nIt is disappointing that the government has no plans to protect Leicester’s businesses. This lack of support threatens the future of our businesses and ultimately the employment of many of my constituents.\nLeicester City Council has £10 million of earmarked grant cash already sitting in the local authority’s coffers could be used to help ailing businesses – but it needs governmental permission to spend it.\nThe government must act now to support our community.\nRead the letter here.\nIt is great to come together with my colleagues Leicester MP’s Jonathan Ashworth and Liz Kendall in sharing this message and pleased to have finally finished this video.\nWe are all part of our great city of Leicester, where our diversity is our strength.\nThis extended period of lockdown has been a real challenge for our residents, and our thoughts remain with all those affected by coronavirus.\nBy standing together, rejecting those who seek to divide our communities, and following all the health advice – we will defeat this virus, and a brighter future will be in reach.\nI am proud to sign this joint cross party letter led by Dr Lisa Cameron MP alongside many representatives and organisations to tackle worker exploitation.\nTo avoid the exploitation we have seen in some elements of Leicester’s Garment Industry, the Government must implement a ‘Fit to Trade’ licensing scheme that ensures all garment factories are meeting their legal obligations to their employees.\nGarment workers in Leicester are already surviving well below the poverty line even before the onset of Coronavirus. We all have a responsibility to protect the workers who are making the clothes we wear.When Factories are shut and workers are sent home they receive no income, no sick pay, no furlough pay, no protection. While fashion brands and billionaires profit inequalities are deeply embedded in the supply chain.\nWe must protect all workers in supply chains and please sign this.\nIts disastrous for our entire Leicester community to remain in Lockdown. According to the evidence and data provided the rate of positive testing for Leicester as a whole remains much higher than the national average and higher than neighbouring cities.\nThe new map for the area of Lockdown has been published and I attach it below. I’ve sought reassurances that economic support is extended and expanded. All work places must adhere to health and safety and, no one should be forced to work in unsafe conditions. United we must defeat this virus.\nI will keep working tirelessly to lobby the government, public health officials and local stakeholders to ensure that Leicester receives the best possible protection from COVID19.\nI am proud to have signed this important joint letter. Leicester’s diversity is our strength. I wholeheartedly reject those seeking to blame our residents and our different communities for this outbreak.\nLeicester’s Garment Industry and the crisis it presents is just a microcosm of the global assault on worker’s rights.

Yet at a time of unprecedented upheaval, it is important that lives and public health are prioritised above all else.\nThat’s why I tabled this EDM, to stand in solidarity with the people of Leicester at this difficult time.\nLeicester’s diversity is our strength.\nI wholeheartedly reject those seeking to blame our residents and our different communities for this outbreak.\nWhen we stand together in unity there is nothing we cannot accomplish. See full article on Leicester’s #BLM march here.\nWith Leicester required to maintain lockdown measures, it will be necessary for economic support to be extended and expanded.\nIt is impossible for impoverished people to comply with guidance on self-isolation and social distancing.\nIt is therefore not just morally imperative, but in the best public health interest of everyone in our country that people’s basic needs are met.\nI will continue to fight on behalf of Leicester East in Parliament to have this heard.\nI have written to the Prime Minister regarding instances of employer malpractice in some parts of Leicester’s garment industry.\nAt Prime Minister’s Questions today, Boris Johnson sought to blame the exploitation of workers in Leicester’s garment industry on our local City Mayor. Yet his government has known about this issue for years, rejected all the recommendations of a 2019 Environmental Audit Committee report into this issue, and slashed the funding of the Health and Safety Executive.\nThe Prime Minister must take responsibility for these failures. I share the dismay of many that the government has long been aware of instances of exploitation and issues yet failed to act.\nIt is appalling that the exploited labour of the workers of Leicester East is helping to finance extravagant corporate salaries at Boohoo and other corporate giants. This demonstrates the stark inequality that exists in our society and is proof that the obscene wealth of billionaires is built on the exploitation of the working class.\nAfter this crisis, Leicester can no longer be known as ‘the sweatshop’ of Europe. I urge the government to prove that it prioritises public health over private profit by beginning to take workers’ rights seriously.\nSales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have helped fuel a rapid growth that could reward Boohoo’s bosses, including a billionaire, with bonuses worth £150m as part of a three-year incentive scheme.\nIt is appalling that the exploited labour of my constituents is helping to finance such extravagant corporate salaries.\nThis demonstrates the stark inequality that exists in our society, and is proof that the obscene wealth of the few is built on the exploitation of the many.\nAfter this crisis, Leicester can no longer be known as the sweatshop of the UK. The government must prove that it prioritises public health over private profit by beginning to take workers’ rights seriously.\nYou can read the full article outlining my concerns in the Morning Star here.\nI have received a huge number of enquires relating to the Leicester Lockdown.\nI want to help and advocate for as many individuals, families, businesses, groups and organisations as possible. Please email or telephone me direct. My motto is to always be on your side.\nIf you require basic information this dedicated page on my website will help you navigate the system and range of guidance provided. Click here\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, we must forge a new social settlement – a Green New Deal to rebuild the country with a more just and sustainable economy.\nWe must fight for a society in which public health always comes before private profit. And it must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs, not ordinary people.\nAs a Member of Parliament I first spoke up about this issue on 9th March 2020.\nIn Leicester’s garment industry today many workers, overwhelmingly women, earn well below the minimum wage; working in unthinkable conditions. This is the legacy of Tory deindustrialisation\nLeicester can no longer be known as the UK’s sweatshop of Europe.\nAt every step in this crisis – from lockdown delay, equipment shortages, care home neglect, testing delays, insufficient data and much more – the government has failed to adequately protect our communities.\nSadly, when it comes to localised outbreaks, the government has not learned from its repeated national failures.\nAs we go forward, the government must learn the lessons from its mismanagement of Leicester’s spike in coronavirus cases.\nRead my full article in The Guardian here.\nAs anti-racists, the task ahead of us is not only to defeat this virus, but also to build a world free of the racial inequalities which have exacerbated its brutal impact.\nThe government’s recklessness has already cost too many lives, especially from African, Asian and minority ethnic communities. They must ensure that their rush to relax lockdown does not lead to even greater suffering.\nCheck out my article for Eastern Eye here.\nThe government must act now to prevent the further impoverishment of working people and their families during this pandemic. This virus has demonstrated that we have a moral duty to ensure that everyone in Leicester and across the UK is protected.\nThat means that, after this crisis, we can no longer live in a society defined by extreme inequality and in which it is commonplace for our children to go to bed hungry.\nI welcome this plan to tackle racial discrimination in football and I commend the “BAME Football Forum” for their tireless work combatting Racism and hatred in football.\nOver recent years, we have seen unacceptable racism across all levels of football. Whilst there is still much to do, recently we have been reminded how the sport can be a force for good.\nMarcus Rashford led an inspiring campaign to ensure children do not go hungry. Premier League players have taken the knee and worn shirts in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.\nIt is up to the FA and PFA to help continue this momentum by adopting these necessary recommendations.\nRead the plan here.\nWe are a city of solidarity. People from all backgrounds are continuing to work together as we find ourselves in another lockdown.\nI want to sincerely thank all the mutual aid groups and volunteers for the exceptional work they do to support our community in Leicester East.\nBy standing together, in unity, we will overcome this virus.\nLeicester has the largest number of garment workers in the UK. There are an estimated 1500 garment manufacturing businesses in the city employing around 10,000 people, the majority from African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nA recent study by HMRC found that, over a six year period, a quarter of all UK textile factories caught failing to pay minimum wage were based in Leicester, with some textile factories reportedly offering less than £3.50 an hour.\nA recent report published by the organisation Labour Behind the Label entitled ‘Boohoo & COVID-19: The people behind the profits’ found ‘emerging evidence indicates that conditions in Leicester’s factories, primarily producing for Boohoo, are putting workers at risk of COVID-19 infections and fatalities.’\nhe government has published Public Health England’s Rapid Investigation Team (RIT) Preliminary investigation into COVID-19 exceedances in Leicester.\nThe report found that six out of the seven wards in Leicester East were in the top ten worst affected– with North Evington the worst affected area.\nThe infection rate recorded in the community from ‘pillar-2 testing’ – swab tests conducted outside NHS hospitals and Public Health England labs – was more than four times higher than the average for England. Yet this was not provided to Leicester’s health departments for 11 days. The report found that, of the 3,216 cases in the city, almost a third, 944, came in the past 14 days.\nThe study also found that many of the reported incidents are related to food factories and outlets, and that the average age of those infected is around 40.\nI have received correspondence from hundreds of Leicester residents in opposition to the illegal annexation of Palestinian land.\nThe international community must stand against this clear violation of a peaceful two state solution.\nYour Member of Parliament working for you across Leicester East\nClaudia Webbe MP, Member of Parliament for Leicester East is responsible for the production of the content of claudiawebbe.org.\nClaudia Webbe MP\nMember of Parliament for Leicester East\nHouse of Commons\nLondon\nSW1A 0AA\nTel: 0207 219 3000\nMobile: 07973 816885\nFreephone: 0800 799 9870\nEmail: [email protected]\n©2021 Copyright Claudia Webbe All rights reserved.\n| Cookie | Duration | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| cookielawinfo-checkbox-analytics | 11 months | This cookie is set by GDPR Cookie Consent plugin.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-nhs-is-a-gleaming-beacon-of-human-achievement-we-must-protect-it/content_791.html": "The NHS is a gleaming beacon of human achievement – we must protect it.\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWith Parliament rising for the belated summer recess, the Conservative government’s final act of term has left a dangerous cloud over those of us who fear for the future of our NHS, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE Tories have repeatedly asked the public to simply trust, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, their promise that the NHS is “not for sale” in any future trade deals with the US. During the 2019 General Election, Labour obtained proof that the NHS was ‘on the table’ in secretive talks between Britain’s negotiators and US representatives.\nYet rather than take these worrying claims seriously, much of the media instead chose to allege that Labour was somehow colluding with Russian attempts to interfere with British democracy — an outrageously false distraction that must have left Number 10 spin doctors rubbing their hands in glee.\nLast week provided the government with an opportunity to put these fears to bed, as Labour tabled an amendment to its post-Brexit Trade Bill explicitly stating that the NHS would be excluded from any future trade agreements. This was supported by more than 400 doctors and health professionals. Yet, rather than deliver on their promise, not a single Tory MP voted for the amendment — which was defeated by 89 votes.\nThe government claims, farcically, that it voted against the amendment because it legitimises the concept of NHS privatisation — which, in the realms of hypotheticals and metaphysics, the Tories claim to oppose.\nYet when faced with a concrete opportunity to enshrine in law the safety of our most treasured public institution, the Conservatives sat on their hands. Now our NHS is at the mercy of US negotiators, who are heavily influenced by the multibillion-dollar private healthcare industry which has a vested interest in carving up our health service for corporate gain.\nThis clearly demonstrates the government’s commitment to ensure that the NHS is ”on the table” during trade negotiations. Yet there is an even clearer reason why we cannot trust the government when it says that the NHS is not for sale; it has been selling it off piece by piece for the best part of a decade.\nSince the Conservatives’ disastrous 2012 Health and Social Care Act, NHS outsourcing and privatisation has been incentivised. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are under pressure to outsource and, in 2015, private firms won 40 per cent of all contracts. In the last five years alone, private companies were handed £15 billion worth of NHS contracts. Eighteen per cent of healthcare bids now go to private providers, including Virgin Care and the Priory Group — an US healthcare company.\nSo, when senior members of the government such as Chancellor Rishi Sunak claim that “the NHS is not for sale. Never has been, never will be” — they are peddling a blatant mistruth about their own record on privatisation.\nIt is true that the NHS logo remains, and in some cases is even used by private providers, yet the direction of travel under this government has been towards a fragmented, underfunded and increasingly privatised healthcare system. As Noam Chomsky once said, this is “the standard technique of privatisation: defund, make sure things don’t work, people get angry, you hand it over to private capital.”\nEven before any potential influence of a brutal US trade deal, the government has squandered billions to service its ideological commitment to privatisation. According to research by We Own It, the government is wasting as much as £10 billion a year on running an internal market in the NHS.\nEvery penny spent on NHS privatisation and outsourcing is a penny less spent on patient care. The amount we spend on the internal market would be enough to pay for 72,000 nurses and 20,000 doctors.\nThis follows the same pattern of privatisation which has decimated many of our essential services since Thatcher’s deregulation agenda in the 1980s. Across the transport, energy, water, mail and healthcare sectors — the British public pay more for worse services simply to enrich the pockets of shareholders.\nThe dangers of sliding towards a US-style private insurance healthcare system cannot be overstated. Research by The Commonwealth Fund in 2018 found that nearly half of working-age US citizens, a staggering 87 million people, were either underinsured or had no coverage at all.\nRather than spending money on doctors, nurses, mental health specialists, dentists, and other professionals who provide services to people and improve their lives, the US wastes hundreds of billions of dollars a year on profiteering, huge executive compensation packages, and outrageous administrative costs. Despite widespread myths regarding the efficiency of the “free” market, the US state spends nearly double what we spend on healthcare for generally worse healthcare results.\nIt is common sense that, in services essential to human life, profiteering and corporate greed should be off limits. This is reflected in public polling, which shows that 84 per cent of Britons believe the NHS should be in public ownership. Even the Conservatives are aware of the unpopularity of NHS privatisation — that is why they maintain their empty promises to protect its public status at the same time as flogging off sections to the highest bidder.\nThe NHS is a gleaming beacon of human achievement, the embodiment of socialist, universal principles in which everyone — no matter their position in society — benefits equally. When Labour created the NHS in 1948, the Conservatives opposed it every step of the way — voting against it on 21 occasions.\nNow 72 years later, they are shamelessly lying through their teeth as they place our NHS on a silver platter for predatory international private interests. It is up to all of us who value healthcare as a human right to keep up the fight to protect our most treasured public institution.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_together-we-can-end-the-exploitation-in-leicesters-garment-industry/content_813.html": "Together we can end the exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nCLAUDIA WEBBE reports on a groundbreaking new initiative that is stepping in to defend workers where the government and big business have failed\nTHE unprecedented economic impact of the coronavirus, including the disgraceful increase in “fire-and-rehire” tactics, has laid bare the weakness of Britain’s labour protections.\nNowhere has this been more apparent than in my home city of Leicester, where a resurgence of much-needed attention has highlighted the continued severe exploitation in sections of our garment industry.\nDespite endemic exploitation being widely studied for over a decade, painfully little action has been taken to protect garment workers in Leicester and around the world.\nThat’s why myself, along with a range of trade unions and civil society stakeholders, have launched a new initiative that is ambitiously designed to end the spectre of exploitation that continues to haunt the garment industry.\nThe Leicester Garment Workers Advice and Support Project, which I announced at an inspiring community event at the Highfields Centre in Leicester, represents the most significant intervention on behalf of garment workers seen for decades.\nThis initiative is stepping in where the government and big business have failed. While neglect and ignorance comes from the top of government and big business, solidarity and collective support is organised from below.\nThe Leicester Garment Workers Advice and Support Project (L-GWASP) is a community-led project that will employ outreach community workers who are able to connect and build trust with garment workers and a wide range of agencies — including community groups, brands and unions — to provide support, advice, information, and assistance to garment workers.\nThe ultimate vision is to build a vibrant and supportive community hub to combat the culture of neglect and exploitation that has been allowed to fester for far too long.\nThe task will not be easy as the project will need to reach up to 10,000 workers in over 700 factory units, which themselves have a combined turnover of at least £1.4 billion.\nThe mission of the project is simple; to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable workers through awareness raising, disrupting exploitative practices, and protecting the rights of all workers by promoting decent work.\nThis project will ensure the inclusion of worker and community voices, as we know that we can only end this crisis by centring the experience of those who have been exploited.\nPerhaps the most vital aspect, which I have been pushing for, is a pre-union membership agreement that will enable trade unions to offer support for workers regardless of their trade union membership status.\nThis is especially necessary as the culture of fear and exploitation within the garment industry has prevented trade unions from establishing a foothold.\nCurrently, far too much of the onus to expose the extent of garment industry exploitation is put back on workers themselves who fear coming forward as it is.\nDiscussions have already started with the Trade Union Congress on how it will support effective training and advice on legal rights and the development of worker complaints mechanisms.\nExisting stakeholders include the Ethical Trading Initiative, Labour Behind the Label, the Trade Union Congress, and some brand representatives.\nThis groundbreaking intervention is essential because not nearly enough is being done by the current Conservative government and the underfunded regulatory institutions to combat this crisis of exploitation.\nBecause of unscrupulous bosses, workers are still not being paid at least the minimum wage and remain for years on zero-hours contracts without access to holiday pay, sick pay, meal breaks or time-off pay.\nThere are still grave concerns regarding the illegal use of furlough, double record keeping and unsafe and dangerous work environments. The project is a crucial step forward in combatting these evils.\nSome welcome initiatives have been taken in the past, such as the Fast Forward initiative and the Apparel and General Merchandise Public Private Protocol.\nFormed in 2018, the latter committed signatories to work together to raise awareness to prevent worker exploitation, protect vulnerable and exploited workers and disrupt exploitative practices and help bring criminals to justice.\nHowever, as provenly exploitative brands such as Boohoo count among the signatories, initiatives such as this are not enough to protect vulnerable workers in Leicester and across the world.\nEarlier this year, Boohoo cut ties with a number of manufacturers it said were unable to demonstrate the high standard of transparency required.\nThey failed to compensate the workers for the exploitation they found. In May, it updated a list of suppliers it would continue to work with. The list includes more than 50 factories in Leicester. Yet a media investigation in tandem with the anti-modern slavery charity Hope for Justice found that a boss at one of Boohoo’s approved factories had found a new way to avoid paying staff the legal minimum wage by forcing staff instead to withdraw cash from their “legal payslip” and return it to the factory.\nSadly, stories like this are routine. A recent study by the British Retail Consortium found that at least £2.1 million per week was being stolen from Leicester workers in the form of underpaid wages.\nI am dealing with cases every week of workers telling me about how poorly they are being treated and how they are being severely underpaid and made to repay wages and holiday pay.\nThe system is fully rigged against workers. If a garment worker does manage to build the courage to go on the record, HM Revenue and Customs — which is meant to enforce the minimum wage — requires each worker to report their case via an online complaint form or via Acas and even then it often takes up to six months or more before anyone gets back in touch with the worker. Meanwhile, the garment worker is left without support and no alternative.\nWhen fast-fashion companies like Boohoo routinely sell clothes for a few pounds or less, the factories in their supply chain are inevitably locked in a damaging race to the bottom.\nI have met with brands including New Look, Misguided and Asos that have expressed an interest in improving the situation.\nThere are also some commendable factories in Leicester like GK Fashion Ltd. However, not a single factory in Leicester has any formal union recognition. This creates a vicious cycle.\nWe are engaged in a relentless class war where the labour of the working poor is used by the capitalist class against the same workers in furthering the ongoing exploitation of the working class.\nTrade unions are the best line of defence against workplace exploitation and we must demand the government opens the door for their involvement.\nUnions must be granted access to Leicester workplaces to inform workers about the benefits of union membership and collective bargaining.\nIt also must be made easier for working people to negotiate collectively with their employer, including simplifying the process that workers must follow to have their union recognised for collective bargaining.\nThe scope of these collective bargaining rights must also be widened and trade unions should be actively involved in labour market inspections.\nThe Leicester Garment Workers Advice and Support Project will be a crucial step in making this a reality.\nWe can no longer sit idly by while billionaire brand owners increase their wealth at the expense of the safety, dignity, and wellbeing of workers in Leicester and across the world.\nWe must demand that the government matches the ambition shown by this new project and legislate to eradicate the scourge of exploitation that continues to plague our garment industry.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_britain-has-a-duty-to-protect-the-people-of-sri-lanka/content_665.html": "‘Britain has a duty to protect the people of Sri Lanka’\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nNEARLY 12 years since the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka, almost no one has been held accountable for international crimes, and the alleged perpetrators continue to occupy key positions in the current government. This impunity for past abuses is enabling ongoing violations.\nThe Sri Lankan government recently passed the 20th amendment to the constitution, a major challenge to democratic governance. The amendment, which has been opposed1 by civil society and religious leaders, removes almost all checks on the power of the president2.\nIn January, the UN high commissioner for human rights released a damning report on Sri Lanka. It draws attention to “clear early warning signs of a deteriorating human rights situation and a significantly heightened risk of future violations” and calls on the international community to take strong preventive action.\nThe warning signals include the accelerating militarisation of civilian governmental functions, reversal of important constitutional safeguards, political obstruction of accountability, exclusionary rhetoric, intimidation of civil society, and the use of anti-terrorism laws. Indeed, Freedom from Torture has documented more than 300 cases of torture by the state since the end of the war in 2009, and the organisation continues to receive referrals for Sri Lankans who have been tortured.\nThe report also documents a pattern of intensified surveillance and harassment of civil society organisations, human rights defenders and victims, and a shrinking space for independent media.\nTamil and Muslim minorities within Sri Lanka are being increasingly marginalised3 and excluded in statements about the national vision and government policy. Divisive and discriminatory rhetoric from the highest state officials’ risks generating further polarisation and violence. Sri Lanka’s Muslim community is increasingly scapegoated, both in the context of Covid-19 and in the wake of the Easter Sunday attacks of April 2019.\nThe issue which Sri Lankan residents of Leicester East have raised with me most are reports of the forced cremation of victims of Covid-19, including those of Muslim and Christian faith for whom burial rituals and traditions are sacred. Enforced cremations contravene human rights and must never take place against the wishes of an individual or their loved ones.\nI welcome the fact that in February, the Sri Lankan government finally ended the practice of forced cremations4 following diplomatic efforts by prime minister Imran Khan of Pakistan. Yet there are concerning reports that other forms of religious discrimination remain. It is vital that one type of religious discrimination is not replaced with another.\nThe UK government’s draft resolution on Sri Lankan human rights for the UN Human Rights Council5 is far too weak and does not reflect the strong recommendations put forward by the UN high commissioner for human rights. The UK must work with its international partners to strengthen the resolution and apply diplomatic pressure on the Sri Lankan government to abide by its human rights responsibilities.\nAbout £6.3 million of UK taxpayers’ money has been spent on supporting security reform in Sri Lanka6, yet this has only enabled the Sri Lankan security forces to advance more antagonistic activities, including the accelerated destruction of places of worship and cultural heritage. Rather than financing this encroaching authoritarianism, the UK government must instead consider applying strategic conditionalities to aid and trade where they will incentivise the government to respect human rights and the rule of law and not cause harm to the general population.\nThe UK must also halt defence engagement with the Sri Lankan military7 and withdraw the resident defence advisor from Colombo as part of the process of holding the Sri Lankan military accountable for past and ongoing violations. The UK government must also consider which senior figures in Sri Lanka might warrant inclusion under the UK’s Global Sanctions Regime, which is designed to target individual human rights abusers with asset freezes and visa bans.\nAs has been the case with the struggle of the Indian farmers, the silence of the government over human rights violations in Sri Lanka has been unacceptable. Yet this is not surprising, as a recently leaked recording8 of foreign secretary Dominic Raab revealed him boasting that the UK intended to trade with countries with poor human rights records.\nThe UK government is anxious to improve relations with authoritarian regimes so that it can secure post-Brexit trade deals. However, I believe that international relationships must be deeper than just trade and must be based on the promotion of democracy, human rights and upholding international law.\nIt is alarming that this is the ‘Global Britain’ promised by the prime minister and his allies. A Britain which has alienated itself on the world stage by cosying up to authoritarian regimes, and which remains complicit in the suffering of millions across the globe.\nThe UK government must end this cowardice, and finally prioritise the needs, wellbeing and public safety of the Sri Lankan people above the interests of private profit.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_an-international-atrocity-that-is-being-ignored/content_747.html": "An international atrocity that is being ignored\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe genocide and abuse of human rights in Southern Cameroons is a barbaric crime – we can longer be silent, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nSADLY, there are so many sites of suffering in the world that some crises do not receive the urgent attention that they deserve.\nThe genocide and abuse of human rights in the war between separatists and the authoritarian government in Southern Cameroons, also known as Ambazonia, is an international atrocity — yet one that is not nearly discussed enough.\nThe global community must begin to act on the scale that the crisis demands.\nThe figures alone are appalling. Since violence began in 2017, 35,000 have been killed. Five hundred villages have been burnt. Over a million children have been deprived of education. More than half a million people have become refugees, with more than 1.5 million people internally displaced. 10,000 people are imprisoned. 5,000 people have been maimed. 10,000 people have been raped. 10,000 women have become widows, and 15,000 children have been orphaned.\nThis is an intolerable situation. Yet it has also been neglected for too long by the international community.\nGenocide Watch has described the situation as an “extermination,” and Human Rights Watch has documented how armed groups and government forces committed widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial or summary executions and mass killings.\nThe government’s continued restrictions on freedom of expression and association have become increasingly intolerant of political dissent.\nPolitical space has been limited as authorities cracked down on opponents of President Paul Biya and his ruling party.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has also been used as a pretext to silence the opposition and quell dissent.\nAmnesty International reports that fighting between various armed groups and the Cameroonian armed forces has continued unabated for the past three years, with civilians bearing the brunt of unlawful killings, kidnappings and widespread destruction of houses and villages.\nGovernment intervention has been limited, and there has been near-complete silence from the international community.\nArmed separatist groups have killed, tortured, assaulted and kidnapped hundreds of people.\nThey have also prevented humanitarian workers and teachers from doing their jobs, depriving children of access to education.\nWe must consider the impact of Britain’s colonial legacy on modern-day global insecurity.\nPresent-day global inequalities remain permanently shaped by the horrors of extractive colonialism and racialised subordination.\nThe brutal history of the British empire casts a long and enduring shadow on present day global dynamics.\nWe cannot talk about the present without former empires engaging in a process of recognition, apologies, returning what was stolen and reparations for past atrocities.\nThis is certainly the case with the so-called “Anglophone crisis” in Southern Cameroons since 2017.\nThe history of Southern Cameroons is inseparable from the history of violent imperialism.\nThe area of present-day Cameroon was claimed by Germany as a protectorate during the murderous so-called “Scramble for Africa” at the end of the 19th century.\nAfter the first world war, Germany’s colonies were brutally redivided, with Britain controlling one part of the former German territory of Cameroon and France controlling another.\nIn 1960 France granted its colony independence. Britain, however, had a different proposition, put to the people in a referendum in February 1961: join Nigeria or the newly formed Republic of Cameroon.\nThe Anglophone Cameroonians who opted in that referendum to form a federation with French Cameroon soon found the terms of that union were void.\nThe promise of equality was never kept, with the English-speaking minority facing widespread discrimination and repression since the 1960s.\nTherefore, the current crisis would not be taking place if Britain had granted its former colony independence in 1961.\nWhat is now referred to as the “Anglophone crisis” is in fact yet another hangover of British colonial rule and imperial arrogance.\nBritain is therefore complicit in the suffering of the people of Southern Cameroons — and the British government has a moral duty to act to end the suffering.\nIn the past three years, Britain has spent around £20 million on humanitarian aid to Southern Cameroons — yet this is no way near sufficient given our historical responsibility for the crisis.\nTo put this into perspective, Britain spent over £100m in a partnership deal with Saudi Arabia in 2018.\nBritain has also failed to use its diplomatic power to bring this crisis to an end.\nIt is also shameful that the British government has cut development funding at a time of global crisis, especially at the same time it announced an unprecedented peacetime increase in military spending.\nTurning its back on the world’s poorest is a political choice the government has made, not a political necessity.\nRather than stand up to our historical responsibility to the peoples that were oppressed under the British empire, our government has denied the true history of colonialism.\nThe international community must publicly call on the Cameroonian authorities to urgently initiate thorough, independent, impartial investigations into allegations of human rights violations and, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, prosecute those suspected of criminal responsibility in fair trials before ordinary civilian courts without recourse to the death penalty.\nIn addition, the international community must ensure that the humanitarian response aimed at addressing the needs of those affected by the violence, including refugees and those internally displaced, is adequately funded.\nBritain must abandon its hostile environment policy for refugees and asylum-seekers, which has only worsened with the dreadful Nationalities and Borders Bill, and welcome those fleeing Southern Cameroons.\nAs violence by both security forces and armed separatists continues, Anglophone civilians are at an increased risk of future genocidal massacres.\nInternational actors must recognise the urgency of the crisis and encourage the government of Cameroon and separatist groups to reach a diplomatic resolution through the implementation of targeted sanctions on those most responsible for ongoing violence.\nIt is vital that these sanctions do not have a negative impact on citizens of Cameroon, as international sanctions too often do.\nBritain and the international community must use diplomatic pressure to ensure that the Cameroonian government and separatist groups must follow UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres’s call for a global ceasefire to help combat Covid-19, something myself and others have been campaigning on for over a year, and immediately end attacks on civilians to reach a ceasefire agreement.\nBeyond this, both the government and separatist groups must agree to participate in mediation efforts, sponsored by a third party, aimed at achieving meaningful dialogue.\nAn investigation must be launched in conjunction with the African Union and/or the United Nations into crimes against humanity and other international crimes committed during the Anglophone crisis to end the ongoing cycle of impunity.\nFinally, humanitarian channels must be reopened to allow for the inflow of necessary medical supplies, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as essential aid for Anglophones suffering as a result of the continued violence and destruction of critical infrastructure.\nI have written to the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary urging them to take this necessary action.\nThe violent imperialism of the past continues to shape the current-day realities, which is why the liberation of Ambazonia remains the ultimate goal for the people of Southern Cameroons.\nThe international community must finally wake up to this crisis. It is vital that we always stand in full solidarity with everyone in the struggle for peace and justice, in Cameroon and across the world. Together, we can build a future free of war and suffering.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_this-is-a-johnson-brexit-deal-and-he-must-be-made-to-own-it/content_304.html": "This is a Johnson Brexit deal – and he must be made to own it\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe EU agreement oven-bakes free market capitalism into the fabric of our economy and is harmful to Britain, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTOMORROW MPs will vote on the EU-UK agreement. Boris Johnson has MPs over a barrel.\nHe has apportioned just 150 minutes debating time to the near 2,000-page document that will determine the future trading relationship with our biggest trading partner.\nHe will not allow us to place amendments, and the alternative to it passing is the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal.\nA no-deal Brexit is the worst possible outcome. This is not democratic accountability. This prevents MPs from scrutinising the legislation. Below, I lay out why the deal he has signed is a terrible deal for Britain.\nThe EU and UK trade deal which was published on Boxing Day hardwires neoliberalism permanently into the future trading relationship between the UK and Europe.\nMake no mistake, this is a capitalist Brexit in the ugliest terms. Time and time again the document places the economic interests of hedge-fund capitalists ahead of British manufacturing.\nIt places shareholders ahead of taxpayers. It commits our railways, NHS and energy market to perpetual privatisation.\nThis is a blueprint to convert the UK’s public assets into economic assets for the elite.\nThe deal Johnson has signed commits us to allowing full and unfettered access to our energy markets and public procurement which, sadly, under this Tory government includes our NHS.\nThis deal oven-bakes free market capitalism into the fabric of our economy giving private businesses across Europe the right to take our government to court if they fail to win tendering decisions for chunks of our public services.\nThis means that those who voted to leave the EU in order to rid competition law from our public services will be sorely disappointed as private health moguls who successfully sued our NHS under EU competition law will now be able to do so under UK law.\nIt means that energy customers who paid for electricity at higher rates than our European neighbours from the exact same energy firms will continue to do so.\nMost importantly, it means that renationalising our public services will require full contract buyouts and be much more expensive than could have been the case.\nThis is a bad macroeconomic deal for the UK.\nIn addition, it is bad for those who wanted a close educational relationship with the EU in the future.\nThe cancellation of UK involvement in the Erasmus programme is a hammer blow to young adults who dreamed of spending a semester at a European university to broaden their horizons.\nBritain will become a smaller, more inward-looking place as a result of this deal.\nLikewise, the hostile treatment of EU migrants who want to work in the UK is bad for Britain.\nMillions of EU workers are net contributors to our economy. They add to the economic and cultural fabric of our society.\nDenying access to welfare benefits for workers who will still be flown in to pick strawberries for Wimbledon is petty.\nIt will permanently condemn manual EU workers to working poverty, asking them to survive on less because of where they were born.\nThis is also a bad deal for climate change. The deal contains a token agreement for the EU and the UK to become carbon neutral by 2050.\nA Labour government would have brought that forward by at least 10 years.\nThe climate cannot afford to wait 30 years for neoliberalism to be dragged kicking and screaming into a carbon-neutral world.\nThe watering down of a level playing field of regulations on health and safety and environmental protections will now provide the Tories with an avenue to worsen standards in the workplace in a way that puts workers’ safety in harm’s way and that damages the environment.\nThis deal gives the Tories a way to cut standards in the name of profit. At a time when Leicester and, in particular, my own constituency of Leicester East are fighting to increase safety in the workplace and workers’ rights this is heading in the opposite direction our country needs.\nThis deal is also bad for British manufacturing. The rules of origin will make it very difficult for British car firms to export tariff-free into the EU.\nThis is because the car parts will be deemed to be from outside the UK because they contain components from Japan and other parts of Asia.\nThis will cost jobs in the UK among manufacturing firms that cannot source those parts from UK suppliers.\nThis situation has been created by 40 years of neoliberalism favouring the London Square Mile over the entire UK manufacturing industry, and it will take a generation to put right.\nThis deal also makes it harder for the UK to step in and save firms that are of strategic importance to the UK economy.\nBritish steel is an obvious example. Where an expertise or specialism exists, or where a British industry is considered important to the long-term future of our country, it is crucial that the government can subsidise these industries where necessary, or bail them out if they encounter free market turbulence beyond their control.\nThe deal Johnson has signed with the EU makes this harder as not only does it set sustainability criteria and rules on creating a level playing field but crucially it prohibits bailouts unless a wider economic or societal impact of failure can be proven.\nThis will make it harder for the government to protect UK automotive industries that fall foul of the rules of origin, for example.\nThis deal once again hurts Britain’s long-term economic interests. Johnson has placed the priorities of his hedge-fund pals ahead of the British firms that will struggle after this deal.\nThis deal will pass tomorrow and will become law. Nothing individual MPs can now do will stop this.\nWith a very heavy heart, we will be subjected to a bad deal over a no deal. I promise you I will work my hardest to campaign for the worst parts of this deal to be renegotiated by a future Labour government.\nWe must foster a deal which treats EU migrants, who give their working lives to our economy, far better.\nWe need to campaign for better environmental protections and prevent this agreement being used to rip up important health and safety legislation at a time when more protections are needed.\nUltimately, we must remove permanent neoliberalism from our relationship with Europe.\nWhether you voted Remain or Leave, this is a bad deal, it is not our Brexit deal, we do not need to own it.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-must-restore-and-expand-the-nhs/content_474.html": "We must restore and expand the NHS\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nIf we want to save our 75-year-old state-run healthcare system, remembering and recognition are the answer and not ‘reform’ or worker exploitation, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nAS we mark the 75th anniversary of the creation of the NHS this week, at such a distance in time from its founding it’s easy to skim over the scale of the challenges that the Labour government had to overcome to achieve it — and if we were to believe the majority of political and media narrators, the challenges it now faces require more or less all of its founding principles to be undone to “save” it.\nWe have been told for more than a decade now by successive Conservative governments that the investment required to maintain the NHS would be “unsustainable” — without the endless series of Tory “reforms,” of course.\nAt the same time, we’re also told ad nauseam that the Tories are, in fact, putting “record” sums into the NHS — the politicians and talking heads always leave out that a penny over the last budget would be a “record” and yet the NHS budget has faced almost unbroken real-terms cuts disguised as “records.”\nThis narrative — that the NHS crisis and its solution are all about funding — is used as cover for the real greatest threat to the NHS: the programme of closures, fragmentation and privatisation that goes under the umbrella of “integrated care.” The NHS is not sustainable, we’re told, unless care is pushed out of hospitals into some mythical community setting, with the private sector playing an increasing role in “delivery.”\nAnd tragically for our nation’s greatest achievement, that narrative and agenda has very little political opposition and instead, there are open pledges by politicians to firstly continue or even increase the private provision of NHS services and secondly support the integrated care “reform” of the NHS — which in reality amounts to a programme of closures to expand private healthcare.\nEven the supposed “solution” in the form of the NHS workforce plan — which the Tories recently put forward — of hundreds of thousands of new staff magically identified or trained and placed in the NHS — is a ruse.\nIn reality, it is cover for a continuation of the plan that has always underlain integrated care — the failure to address pay and end worker exploitation. Without addressing this issue, the mass exodus of doctors, nurses and other specialists will continue. This equally applies to the failure to address the downgrading of the profession, whereby “111” service operators are reading from scripts, pharmacists are consulted instead of GPs and higher-grade nurses are used instead of doctors.\nBut of course, despite the scale of the scandal of NHS privatisation, ward closures, hospital closures, understaffing, low pay and more, the fact that the NHS was created in the first place exposes the lie that the change that is actually needed is somehow unaffordable, unachievable or, that term beloved of its opponents, “unsustainable.”\nIn 1948, just three years after the end of WWII, Britain’s national debt dwarfed, in real terms, the current debt. The founders of the NHS faced massive political, institutional, structural and financial barriers to ever getting the new service off the ground — and resistance even from the doctors of the day.\nYet every obstacle was overcome, bypassed or demolished. The NHS was still founded and became, rightly, the nation’s greatest treasure, ending centuries of suffering for millions who were unable to afford healthcare before.\nThat service thrived for decades, until those who were too afraid of the political consequences of a direct attack on it thought of ways to “boil the frog slowly” and attack the NHS under cover of false narratives and, they hope, to avoid the political consequences. What the NHS at 75 needs is not “reform” but remembering and recognition.\nWe must look honestly and unflinchingly at what has been and is being done to our NHS if we are to resist and undo it. It is up to all of us to highlight how we are being misled and misdirected to justify the theft and destruction of the NHS we paid for.\nThis requires fearlessness on the part of Parliamentarians who still love our health service and on the part of those who campaign outside Parliament for it, to speak out that more funding for private providers is not the solution for the NHS.\nIf we cannot rely on our politicians to ensure that the denial of care and the collapse of services is not built into their plans and manifestos, then we must redouble our efforts to build a mass movement to save our NHS.\nFor anyone who genuinely intends to save our NHS, exposing how integrated care systems exist to enable the cutback of our NHS — no matter what the size of the national budget — cannot be relegated to a secondary campaigning priority.\nJust as in the run-up to 1948, public versus private provision is at the heart of our politics today.\nIf the post-war Labour government could overcome every obstacle to take a wholly private healthcare system and turn it, overnight, into a fully public one, then the same is achievable now, if there is the political will to do it.\nSo, what do we do? Firstly, we must remember — and make sure that others are not allowed to forget. We must refuse every call to “look at how others do it” and insist that how we did it is the benchmark, right here in Britain, with the creation of the NHS.\nOur National Health Service needs NHS principles, not those of other countries, that did not have universal medical care, provided without top-up insurance or out-of-pocket expenses. We did — and we should demand the renationalisation of the NHS and repeal of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.\nSecondly, we must also recognise that “reform” narratives are really a cover for cuts, rationing and privatisation — and refuse to accept them.\nThe government’s NHS Workforce Plan is not the “once in a generation” moment that the government claims, nor is it a way to “save the NHS” in its 75th year. Staffing plans are normal practice, anticipating training needs is normal practice — neglecting to do them for more than a decade, leading to the current massive shortage of fully trained staff, is vandalism, not oversight.\nThe new staff plan and its route to filling staff positions en masse, quickly, ignores the NHS’s real needs and is designed to bake in the damage that has been done and ensure private providers can enjoy greater profits.\nThirdly, we must recognise that ever since the formation of the NHS, migrant healthcare workers have helped to build, shape and sustain Britain’s health service. From NHS doctors and nurses to technicians and administrators, their expertise and dedication alongside all workers have helped deliver world-class healthcare to all. Let’s give credit where credit is due.\nAs we mark the 75th anniversary of the NHS, what used to be normal NHS care is fast becoming the prerogative for paying customers only, alongside an endless emphasis on “community care,” “virtual wards,” “hospital at home” and “discharge to assess” instead of the real hospitals and real care that the real NHS was established to represent. Alongside our NHS we also need a national care system built on the same principles of the NHS.\nWe must change the terms of the debate by making it about the real and present damage being done — we will not repair that damage if we don’t stop the corporate thinking that dominates politics.\nIf we want the NHS to be the NHS, we must recognise “reform” for the fraud that it is and reject it — and insist on restoring the NHS to its true self that we all remember.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Yet our government and its cheerleaders act as if forced migration is “not our problem.”\nHome Secretary Priti Patel’s response to this tragedy has been to blame smugglers and illegal traffickers — even though they played no role in Abdulfatah’s death.\nIf the government is in search of an explanation, it should look closer to home — or perhaps in a mirror.\nI currently sit on the foreign affairs committee, which Patel formerly sat on when she was warned of the morbid consequence facing refugees if a safe and legal route to claim asylum was not created.\nThe British government has persistently been warned by experts, migrant charities and parliamentary committees that if it does not open safe and legal routes for people to practice their legal right to claim asylum, then deaths at sea are unavoidable.\nYet the government has proceeded to close the few legal avenues that exist, such as the right to family reunion.\nThis brutal immigration policy, which is echoed to varying degrees across “Fortress Europe,” is the reason why 19,000 migrants were reported dead or missing between 2013 and 2019.\nContrary to the mistruths peddled by right-wing commentators, asylum-seekers do not arrive in Britain to leech off the state — asylum support allowance is a mere £37.75 per week.\nIn the sixth-richest country in the world, there is no reason why we cannot provide a humane pathway for those fleeing persecution to exercise their legal right of appeal.\nIt is also far from the case that Britain is overwhelmed with asylum-seekers, with Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and France registering far more asylum applicants.\nWe must also remember that 83 per cent of worldwide refugees live in developing regions — not industrialised countries — which further reflects the grim, unbalanced nature of global power dynamics.\nThe few asylum-seekers arriving in Britain are treated terribly by this government with many falling foul of pernicious hostile environment policies and held in appalling conditions.\nYet this week we saw what I hope is the beginning of the end of a bastion of migrant mistreatment with the announcement that the women detained in Yarl’s Wood detention centre will be relocated.\nYarl’s Wood has come to be synonymous with the violent, institutionalised racism and sexism that has been hardwired into our immigration system.\nI am delighted that one chapter in its brutal history seems to be ending, and I wholeheartedly congratulate the activists and survivors of detention centres for their victory.\nThe strength and bravery of those who are in or have left detention is a source of constant inspiration and are living proof that — together — we can build a fairer world.\nThe Home Office must now go further by ending indefinite detention and ensuring that Yarl’s Wood is never again used as a detention centre.\nIt must also ensure that asylum-seekers arriving across the channel do not also suffer within its walls, as has been reported.\nThe government will not end the detention crisis unless it completely changes course.\nThat means repealing the 2014 Immigration Act, ending the destructive demonisation of migrants and asylum-seekers and shutting detention centres for good.\nFor those of us on the left, it is crucial that we focus on the reason why we are seeing the dehumanising discourse surrounding migrants and asylum-seekers raising its ugly head once again.\nWe have a government that has overseen the worst coronavirus death rate of any European country as well as the worst recession since records began.\nThis is a government whose classist algorithm put A-level students through an unacceptable ordeal, and which is enriching private companies rather than ensuring the safety of its citizens.\nSadly, the Tories know that, to distract from their litany of failures, they simply have to ratchet up their “tough on immigration” rhetoric, such as by talking about militarising the channel crossing, and the right-wing sections our media landscape will lap it up.\nThis vile demonisation is toxic for our political culture and misdirects the justified anger of the working class towards other victims of global extractive capitalism.\nAs socialists and anti-racists, we cannot let this government off the hook. We must stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the victims of this brutal discourse, and we must ensure that this floundering government is held responsible for its appalling record.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Instead, the British army officer responsible, Dyer, had intentionally paused and redirected his troops’ fire at the most densely packed groups of fleeing civilians. Dyer himself admitted that the crowd was not even warned before shooting began.\nRather than express contrition or back down from his aggression, Dyer then instituted an order forcing Indian men to crawl 200 yards on their bellies if they wished to move along a particular street and had Indians publicly whipped if they came too close to a police officer.\nDespite outrage in India and in Britain, only two days later empire troops committed further atrocities against Indians protesting against the first massacre, using explosives and machine guns to kill another 39 people.\nDyer was never disciplined for his actions. Instead, he was allowed to resign and retire with a pay-off that would be worth more than £1 million today.\nBritain notionally changed its policy to require troops always to use minimal force against civilians, but continued to disregard the policy when it suited Britain’s imperial priorities, for example during the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya.\nThe murders of Jallianwala Bagh were not an anomaly. Instead, they formed part of a chain of genocide and murder that not only characterised the history of the British empire but were used to underpin it.\nAlmost two million Africans died during transportation as slaves to British colonies in the Americas. As many as 29 million died under British rule in India as the empire exported food to Britain while Indian people starved.\nUp to 100,000 died in concentration camps in Kenya as the country rose up against British rule.\nThe Jallianwala Bagh massacre was not an isolated incident but an intrinsic element of the brutal and oppressive colonial system that exploited and oppressed millions, in India and other colonised nations, for centuries.\nWell-known academic and author Michael Parenti said that empires are routinely presented as disinterested institutions that bring peace, order and prosperity — some mythical Pax Britannica — but that the reality is one of brutality and the trampling of the wellbeing and aspirations of conquered peoples.\nThe history of the British empire is one of oppression, exploitation and murder as the authorities prioritised its interests above the lives of those they occupied.\nThat oppression and determined misrepresentation is still at work today and still seen in the British government’s stance on the Amritsar murders.\nMore than a century later, with the empire gone and a supposedly more enlightened age under way, the British government has still not apologised for the murders at Jallianwala Bagh — an atrocity that even Winston Churchill described as “unutterably monstrous.”\nAs Arundhati Roy has stated: “The bullet holes in the walls of the Jallianwala Bagh monument are a reminder of the monstrousness of which we are capable. They are also a reminder that in this country justice is a negotiable commodity.”\nIn a time where reparations for the evils of empire and slavery are widely advocated, there is simply no excuse for the government not to formally and unconditionally apologise for that crime and others it committed to maintain its hold on empire.\nPride, obstinacy, or the desire not to force Britons to acknowledge the history of an empire that is still presented in rosy terms as an overall good — whatever the government’s excuses for not doing so, they are inadequate.\nContinued avoidance is unacceptable and insulting to the memory of the victims and their families. The refusal to properly apologise is a symptom of the British government’s determination, not just to avoid accountability but to dodge the obvious conclusion to be drawn from a proper examination and acknowledgement of this country’s imperial past and the atrocities that underpinned it: that Britain continues to act as an imperialist power and to inflict horror and death on people who differ from the supposedly superior white, Western culture.\nA sincere and unconditional apology from the British government is long overdue and necessary for healing the wounds of the past and fostering a relationship of mutual respect and trust between the two nations. It is the least that is expected of a government that has learned from its past sins, but it remains withheld.\nAnd to add further injury to insult, it seems that the British government refuses even to apply the lessons of the horror of Jallianwala Bagh and other atrocities to its actions today.\nInstead of honouring and enabling legitimate democratic protest, the government is rapidly moving toward greater repression.\nThe British government of today continues to attack our civil and democratic rights. Laws waging war on our right to protest are already far advanced.\nWell before those laws are in place, lawful and peaceful protests are frequently marked by often-brutal policing, while government figures and their spokespeople talk of using the armed forces to destroy the effectiveness of peaceful resistance and industrial action.\nIt is time — indeed very far past time — for the government to formally apologise for the murders and wounding of innocent civilians at Jallianwala Bagh and the countless other atrocities it perpetrated against occupied peoples.\nBut an apology is not enough. The government needs to honour the memory of the victims of its crimes by putting right the wrongs it continues to perpetrate and indeed escalate against people trying to organise and peacefully defend their rights and freedoms and those of others.\nAs we remember their deaths 104 years ago, I honour the memory of the Jallianwala Bagh martyrs and their spirit. I will continue to organise and challenge in Parliament for the government to do the right thing in apologising for its atrocities.\nBut more than that, we must all challenge the government’s continued determination to oppress and exploit those who are standing up for their rights and freedoms, in this country and elsewhere.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_stand-up-to-the-right-wing-policy-plot-operation-red-meat/content_337.html": "Stand up to the right-wing policy plot, ‘Operation Red Meat’\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThis Tory distraction tactic will further demonise refugees and asylum-seekers – we must oppose it, and demand settled status for all, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nWHILE Parliament and the country are understandably focused on the Prime Minister’s repeated mistruths over an apparently endless list of lockdown-breaking parties, the government is accelerating its demonisation of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.\nBoris Johnson shamefully turned to the oldest trick in the reactionary playbook to distract from his flagrant lawbreaking.\nDuring the prolonged “partygate” scandal, No 10 has been busy promoting toxic immigration policies to appease Tory MPs and stave off a vote of no confidence.\nThe government is plotting a series of policy announcements, codenamed Operation Red Meat, to help relieve pressure on the embattled Prime Minister.\nAmong the proposals is a plan to put the military in charge of stopping people from crossing the Channel in small boats to reach Britain.\nUnder the proposals, a rear admiral would direct the Border Force, coastguard, fisheries protection and customs and excise to keep track of and “intercept” those crossing the Channel.\nPeople fleeing war and climate catastrophe would then be escorted to new “migrant hubs” on land for processing.\nNo 10 is also reportedly working on a scheme to send migrants to African countries such as Ghana and Rwanda “for processing and resettlement.”\nA few weeks ago in Parliament, the government confirmed plans to further militarise the border.\nDowning Street policy “experts” have also looked into using powerful sonic weapons to turn back the boats. This would use long-range acoustic devices, such as those used in the US for crowd control, in the Channel.\nThese sound cannon emit noise powerful enough to induce vomiting. This is an abhorrent proposal that we must fight tooth and nail against ever being implemented.\nThe government’s attempts to distract the public with a right-wing policy push, which further victimises refugees and asylum-seekers, is as dangerous as it is pathetic.\nThe fact that this comes just months after 27 people died trying to cross the Channel in November shows that there are no depths this government will not sink to to distract from its sleaze, arrogance and hypocrisy.\nThis is a Prime Minister who is happy to reduce the lives and safety of vulnerable people to political bargaining chips in a desperate attempt to save his own skin. I am grateful to trade unions, especially PCS, that have opposed this callous policy.\nA record 28,300 migrants and refugees attempted to cross the Channel to Britain last year, more than three times the 8,400 who crossed in 2020.\nThere is no sign of a decline this year — the number of people crossing last month was more than double the total for January 2021.\nThe only humane response to this is to open safe and legal routes for asylum. Yet the Home Secretary’s recent asylum system overhaul lacks basic humanity and represents the latest step in this government’s pernicious demonisation of asylum-seekers.\nIt has rightly been criticised by human rights organisations including UNHCR and British Red Cross.\nThe British government has persistently been warned that if it does not open safe and legal routes for people to practice their legal right to claim asylum, then deaths at sea are unavoidable.\nYet it has proceeded to close the few legal avenues that exist, such as the right to family reunion.\nContrary to the mistruths peddled by right-wing commentators, asylum-seekers do not arrive in Britain to leech off the state — asylum support allowance is a mere £37.75 per week.\nAnd far from the myths propagated by the Home Secretary, it is also far from the case that Britain is overwhelmed with asylum-seekers, with Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and France registering far more asylum applicants.\nIn the sixth-richest country in the world, there is no reason why we cannot provide a humane pathway towards stability and dignity for everyone in this country.\nWe must also remember that 83 per cent of worldwide refugees live in developing regions, not industrialised countries, which further reflects the grim, unbalanced nature of global power dynamics that are a legacy of colonialism.\nOperation Red Meat is the latest example of the government’s mistreatment and demonisation of “foreign nationals.”\nIt has sadly been a tried and tested technique of reactionary governments to gild their destructive administrations with a toxic veneer of appearing “strong” on immigration.\nHowever, this divide-and-rule tactic has only ever brought misery to all working people, regardless of their country of birth.\nWe must oppose this demonisation, defeat the march to fascism and stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the victims of this brutal discourse. Yet we also must make life much more tolerable for migrants already living in Britain.\nCitizenship application costs have been rising for more than a decade in an attempt to compensate for austerity-driven cuts to the Home Office budget.\nCurrent fees are now at a staggering £1,330 per adult. This does not include the cost of legal advice, which is often necessary to navigate the complicated, heavily bureaucratic and labyrinthine process.\nIn contrast, the cost of US citizenship is equivalent to a little over £500, while in France it’s under £50.\nChildren are not exempt from this unfair system. Parents who wish to register a child as a British citizen must pay the Home Office £1,012, which is 272 per cent more than the administrative cost of processing the registration and five times more than the European average.\nEvery child citizenship application sees the Home Office pocket £640 in profit. The fee was condemned as unlawful by the High Court in 2019, and the Court of Appeal ruling of February 19 2021 also declared it unlawful, yet the Home Office has yet to end this abhorrent practice.\nChildren born in the UK are not granted automatic British citizenship and are subject to the same inhumane child citizenship fees.\nBritish citizenship must not be solely the preserve of the wealthy. The government must scrap the exorbitant application fees and instead fund the Home Office through increased taxes on big businesses and the super-rich.\nDue to this overly harsh immigration system and hostile environment, there are many British residents who do not have settled status.\nMany undocumented people are destitute and living in the shadows, fearful of what will happen to them if they identify themselves.\nThey cannot access healthcare, emergency shelter and food, nor report or seek protection from domestic violence, rape, exploitation, and other awful abuses.\nIn nearly all cases undocumented people are not criminals but simply those who have fallen through the cracks of the government’s callous hostile environment policies.\nIn a country of deep yet vastly unequal wealth, we must ensure that everyone in this country — regardless of their immigration status — has their basic needs met.\nI was therefore proud to recently write the introduction to a book entitled “Poetry and Settled Status for All: An Anthology.” Poetry and stories help us reach an understanding that we could never have previously imagined.\nBy transporting us into another world, the written word allows us to understand events from another’s perspective and provides a unique insight into the world around us and the people within it.\nThat is the magic of this wonderful anthology of poetry and short fiction, organised by CivicLeicester, which focuses on one of the most pressing political issues of our time — the need for permanent residency for all people living in Britain.\nThe collection includes moving reflections on the lived experience of migration, being an undocumented migrant or seeking refuge.\nIt also powerfully conveys migrant, undocumented migrant and refugee experiences of rural and urban life, education, housing, work, healthcare, immigration and asylum systems, and the hostile environment.\nThe beauty of this collection inspires us to redouble our efforts to ensure that everyone has a secure immigration status, without which it is nearly impossible to build a stable and happy life.\nBecause when we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. It is up to us to build a society in which everyone is valued — no matter their country of birth.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_may-blogs/content_423.html": "31st May\nI have repeatedly written to the Chancellor urging a broader package of support for the Hospitality Industry and have raised individual cases of businesses in Leicester East with the government.\nToo many Hospitality businesses in Leicester and across the country are falling through the cracks of government support due to inflexible guidelines.\nI will keep campaigning on this issue until Leicester’s businesses receive the support they need.\nYou can read my letter to Rishi Sunak here and second letter here more specifically for the need to extend small business grants to small businesses.\n30th May\nMy piece paying tribute to the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn\nMcDonnell is out in the beautiful paper copy of Tribune Magazine\nThe Coronavirus crisis has shown that the world which Jeremy, John and Diane have been fighting for their entire lives is not only possible, but is the only viable option if we are to avoid planetary breakdown.\nThe existential crises we face, from COVID-19 to the climate emergency, can only be tackled by strong collective action which prioritises people and planet over private profit.\nYou can read the full article in the Tribune Magazine here.\n28th May\nToo many hospitality businesses in Leicester East and across the country are falling through the cracks of government support due to inflexible guidelines.\nMany businesses in the hospitality supply chain are ineligible for support as they do not directly provide public facing services from their premises.\nIn Leicester many catering and events companies provide services for weddings and conferences at other venues. These are currently ineligible for a Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant, and are often too large for Small Business Grants. This especially impacts the Asian Wedding Industry, which is of great cultural and financial importance to many of my constituents.\nI implore the government to close these gaps in financial support in order to protect the hospitality industry – which employs many, many Leicester residents.\n28th May\nAt every step in this crisis – from lockdown delay, PPE shortages, care home neglect, testing lies and much more – the Prime Minister has failed to adequately protect Leicester East and communities across the country.\nThat is why the UK has the worst Coronavirus death rate per capita of any country in the world – even worse than the epicentre of China, Trump’s America and Bolsonaro’s Brazil.\n27th May\nAt my latest apperance at the Environmental Audit Committee, I raised the important relationship between Air Pollution and COVID-19 deaths.\nAir pollution is an issue of great importance in Leicester. It is crucial that we learn the lessons from this crisis and build back a cleaner, safer society.\nI agree with Professor Frank Kelly. After the Coronavirus crisis, we must build a greener Leicester and a greener society.\nThat means a reduction to zero in polluting vehicles that cause poor air quality and investment in more walking and cycling and in renewable energy at the local and national level.\n26th May\nFrom the Coronavirus pandemic to the existential threat of climate change, the global community is facing increasingly common enemies.\nRather than appropriating the language of war, our governments should use this moment to end the intolerable suffering caused by global conflicts.\nNow is the time for a true global ceasefire. I am proud to work with Stop the War Coalition on this important campaign.\n25th May\nI have written to the Chancellor regarding the urgent need to expand small business grants and the Coronavirus retail, hospitality and leisure scheme.\nIt has been a mammoth task for Leicester City Council to administer the award toLeicester and get the grant funds out quickly to help many businesses survive through these difficult times, and I congratulate them for the excellent work they have done.\nHowever, there are clear limitations with the government’s scheme which are causing many businesses and charities to fall through the cracks. The government must expand access to crucial support at this difficult time.\n24th May\nMoments of crises often shape the future. From the horror of The Second World War, we created the welfare state and our treasured NHS.\nWhilst the government rightly focuses on tackling the Coronavirus pandemic, the wellbeing of the entire planet relies on us also taking this opportunity to mitigate the existential threat of climate change. I will continue to work with Leicester East residents to ensure we do our bit and progress in working towards a cleaner, greener City.\nCheck out my latest question at the Environmental Audit Committee: https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/2434/pdf/\n24th May\nI am proud to have supported this letter calling for more protections for Deliveroo workers in Leicester East and across the country with the Independent Worker’s Union.\nWe are only as safe as the most vulnerable amongst us. Working class people must be protected at all costs during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n23rd May\nTo all Muslims, in Leicester East and across the UK, Eid Mubarak!\nThis Eid with our physical distancing to slow the spread of the virus; I’m reminded fasting teaches us discipline, sacrifice, mindfulness, reflection & empathy all relevant now.\n22nd May\nThe COVID-19 crisis is, of course, unprecedented. Yet it is also shining a brutal light on existing racial and class inequalities.\nMany have tried to dismiss the imbalance in deaths as being explained by cultural differences. Yet the scourge of institutional racism results in unequal access to quality education, healthy food, liveable wages, and affordable housing – which are the foundations of health and wellbeing.\nThis is the context in which the coronavirus crisis is operating. After this crisis, we can no longer live in a society defined by extreme racial and class inequality.\nIt is up to all of us to fight for that better world.\n22nd May\nThe Coronavirus crisis has demonstrated our dependence on each other, clearly disproving the Thatcherite mantra that ‘there is no such thing as society.\nThursday’s weekly Clap For Carers, and the development of mutual aid groups in Leicester East and across the country, show a new spirit of unity and solidarity.\nNow we need to develop a collective commitment to building a different and more equal economy and society in the years ahead.\nMy column for Morning Star here.\n21st May\nI welcome the government’s U-turn on the removal of the NHS migrant surcharge from health and care workers.\nThe Coronavirus crisis has demonstrated the invaluable contribution that migrants make to Leicester East and communities across the country. Our NHS simply would not function without the sacrifice of people from all over the world.\nThis is a huge victory for all of us who have been campaigning on this issue. I wrote to the Home Secretary urging them to indefinitely end the surcharge for all migrant NHS workers and their family members on the 15th April.\nFrankly, it is embarrassing that it took the government this long to follow common sense. It would have been rank hypocrisy for them to Clap for Carers tonight whilst still sticking to this mean-spirited policy.\nThey must now drop the surcharge for all front-line workers who have kept our society ticking during this crisis.\nThis week, the government also extended Indefinite Leave to Remain to dependant family members of all NHS staff should they tragically die from coronavirus.\nBut why wait until they die? They should simply guarantee the residency of all migrant NHS staff and carers and their dependant families.\nYou can read my letter to Priti Patel here.\n21st May\nAs I have said over and over again, the government has a moral and practical duty to abolish the NHS Surcharge.\nI am glad they have, finally, seen common sense and removed the migrant surcharge for health and care workers.\nNow, the government must go further and drop the surcharge for frontline workers who have kept our country ticking during this crisis.\n21st May\nI am disappointed that the Prime Minister’s response ignored the African, Asian and minority ethnic communities that I specifically raised, especially as Leicester East is one of the most diverse constituencies in the country.\nGiven Boris Johnson’s long history of racist comments, can we trust him to protect our\ncommunities from the disproportionate impact of COVID-19.\n21st May\nI am incredibly proud of the multiculturalism of my home city of Leicester. Our diversity is our strength, and we are so much better than this.\nWe must oppose any attempt to divide our communities based on the colour of our skin, our nationality or religion.\nI stand in solidarity with the TV crew who were abused.\n20th May\nExisting racial and class inequalities, coupled with inadequate government support, mean that working-class people, migrants and African, Asian and minority ethnic communities are at greater risk from and exposure to the Coronavirus.\nAt PMQs today, I asked the Prime Minister what action the government will take now to protect these communities.\nI am disappointed that the Prime Minister’s response ignored the communities that I specifically raised, in accordance with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) evidence especially as my constituency of Leicester East is one of the most diverse in the country.\nI support Labour’s call for all employers, not just the NHS, to risk-assess staff who are at potentially greater risk.\nNHS Management have already issued guidance and said that “BAME personnel be “risk-assessed” and reassigned to duties that leave them at lesser risk of contracting coronavirus” @Nursing Times 29th April 2020 – I welcome this – it should be extended to all employers Nursing Times.\nGiven the Prime Minister’s inadequate response at PMQs, I believe nothing short of a full public enquiry will be required to get to the bottom of the disproportionate impact of this disease.\nI am also dissatisfied by the Prime Minister’s vague, insensitive and generalising use of the term ‘comorbidities’.\nThe last time I checked, being African, Asian or from a minority ethnic community does not automatically mean you have a pre-existing disease or condition. But considering Boris Johnson’s long history of racist comments, it is perhaps not surprising he gave this insufficient answer.\n19th May\nThe Government’s Immigration Bill was not fit for purpose.\nI voted against the Government’s Immigration Bill at Second Reading. We must honour the dedication of all NHS workers no matter their country of birth. This effects a huge part of Leicester’s NHS staff.\nIt is pure hypocrisy for government ministers to applaud NHS staff on Thursday nights in front of TV cameras, then legislate to strip them of their dignity.\n19th May\nIt was a pleasure to volunteer with Human Appeal – UK and the Northfield Neighbourhood Center (ISLAH\nTRUST) in delivering food packages to vulnerable people in Leicester East.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic risks tearing up our social fabric, which was already stretched to breaking point after a decade of cruel austerity.\nThe constituency of Leicester East, due to a decade of austerity and insecure employment, we have 42% of children living under the poverty line. Over 70% of Leicestershire’s poverty-stricken children have at least one parent in work.\nThe fact that a job no longer provides a route out of poverty reveals an unforgivable breakdown in our social contract.Nobody should be forced to suffer the indignity of choosing between heating their home or feeding their family.\n18th May\nToday, my thoughts have been with the Tamil Community in Leicester East on the 11th anniversary of Mullivaikkal, a day of remembrance to honour the memory of those victims who were killed and disappeared in the final weeks of the civil war in Sri Lanka.\nThough communal acts of remembrance are not possible at this time, I know that Tamil communities in Leicester East and across our country will be united together as they pause and reflect upon this solemn day.\nMullivaikkal must also be a reminder that as well as commemorating those who died, we must bring the perpetrators of atrocities to justice. This can only occur through a renewed effort to seek truth, accountability and reconciliation – a purpose we must all remain committed to.\n18th May\nEven before the Coronavirus pandemic, in the fifth richest country in the world, an estimated 8.4 million people struggled to get enough to eat. This is shameful.\nSince the start of the lockdown, food bank use has increased by an average of almost 60%, and 1.5 million people have gone a whole day without eating.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all the food banks, mutual aid groups, charities and religious organisations in Leicester East that are providing a safety net at this perilous time.\n18th May\nI wholeheartedly support the National Education Union’s Five Tests to ensure a safe reopening of schools during the Coronavirus crisis.\nI am gravely concerned that, in order to kick-start sections of the economy, the government are rushing to reopen schools before it is safe to do so. Public health must be driven by evidence and medical advice, not the government’s profit-seeking ideology.\nI will continue to support all schools in Leicester East that are concerned about a premature reopening.\n17th May\nA number of NHS and private healthcare staff, from heart surgeons to nurses, porters and volunteers, have tragically lost their lives to the Coronavirus in the UK.\nAt least 171 deaths have been reported, but the true figure is likely to be higher because not all deaths will be in the public domain.\nIn the current system, if a migrant NHS worker tragically dies due to work related illnesses, the future of their dependent family members living in the UK is not guaranteed. This means vulnerable individuals could face deportation whilst grieving for their loved one. This demonstrates both the heroism of our NHS workers, and the cruelty of the current immigration system.\nNHS staff are at considerable risk, in large part due to the lack of staff testing and shortages of Personal Protective Equipment. For many migrant NHS professionals, the stress of potential ill health, and even death, is compounded by the fact that their family members are not guaranteed a future in the UK.\nThat’s why I have been calling on the government to ensure that, in the tragic event an NHS professional dies of #COVID-19, their family members must be protected and their residency in the UK maintained.\n2nd May\nMy thoughts have been with the loved ones of Leicester residents and beyond who have sadly died from the Coronavirus and with those who are suffering as a result of contracting it.\nWe are all immensely grateful to Leicester’s amazing NHS staff and social care workers who are working tirelessly to help us deal with this pandemic, often in extremely challenging conditions.\nIn recent weeks, there has been a constant rallying cry from politicians, the media and even the Queen that ‘we are all in this together.’\nIt is true that, once it infects someone, this awful disease does not discriminate. The coronavirus crisis has laid bare class and racial inequalities and a fairer society must follow.\nIt’s simply not true to say we are all in it together.",

It was an account of his first week in office, beginning on Thursday, May 13 – a week after he was elected to the £76,500-a-year post.\nAs well as freezing the recruitment process for two roles in his office, Mr Matthews also said he decided on his second day in the post to suspend a number of spending decisions made by his predecessor, Labour’s Lord Willy Bach.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_here-in-britain-we-must-prove-with-actions-that-black-lives-matter/content_542.html": "Here in Britain we must prove with actions that Black Lives Matter\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe need to transform the crucial anti-racist slogan into a reality of daily life, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nI STAND in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter protests and I will continue to support all those across the world who are safely and peacefully protesting systems of racist oppression.\nOrganised peaceful resistance is a force for change and is deserving of our full support.\nAs the inspiring crowds of protesters across the country have shown us in recent weeks, it is crucial that we in Britain do not assume that our institutions are immune from state-sanctioned racialised violence.\nThe brutality of racism in Britain affects us in all walks of life, from police use of force to unfair immigration detentions to the disproportionate number of black children who go to bed hungry.\nThe fact that our own government does not recognise that Britain is a racist country demonstrates the need for peaceful action.\nLet us not forget that we have a Prime Minister who wrote in a 2005 Spectator article that it was only “natural” for the public to fear Islam.\nWho in a 2018 article in the Telegraph compared Muslim women who wear burqas to “letter boxes” and bank robbers.\nWho in a 2002 Telegraph article referred to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles.”\nWho in a 2000 Guardian article wrote that “seeing a bunch of black kids” makes him “turn a hair.”\nThe fact that an overtly racist individual such as Boris Johnson can ascend to the nation’s highest office reveals the corrosive legacy of empire within the British Establishment.\nSadly, our criminal justice system is not immune from this contamination.\nBlack people disproportionately suffer from police use of force in Britain, are more likely to be charged and are over-represented in the prison population.\nAs in the US, it appears the police can act with impunity as they very rarely face criminal prosecutions.\nThere have been no successful prosecutions for deaths in British police custody since 1969.\nNot a single police officer has been convicted for their role in the death of a detainee, despite often compelling and incriminating evidence.\nIn the case of Christopher Alder, a British army veteran who died in police custody in 1998, CCTV footage showed officers at a Hull police station laughing over his dying body for 10 minutes.\nAll were acquitted on the direction of the judge, despite a 2006 independent review concluding they were guilty of racist neglect.\nOnly one of the police officers who, in the words of an inquest, used “unsuitable force” against Sean Rigg, who died in Brixton police station in 2008, faced a single prosecution — for giving false evidence. The officer was then found not guilty.\nThe three officers who were prosecuted for lying under oath after the death of Kingsley Burrell in 2011, which was found to be caused by prolonged restrained, were also found not guilty.\nAn inquiry into the “probably avoidable” death of Darren Cumberbatch in 2017 found that the police use of force, which included punches, batons and Tasers, was “excessive.”\nThe only consequence of his death was that HM Prison and Probation Service will now deliver training for officers to spot acute behavioural disturbance, a move that family representatives described as “too little, too late for Darren.”\nJust five days before the brutal murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, Simeon Francis was found dead in a Torquay police cell.\nIt took over 24 hours for the police to issue a statement, and while a police watchdog investigation has been announced, any successful prosecution remains uncertain.\nThe average age of these five black men was 34 at the time of their death.\nTragically, these are just some of the many who have died after encountering British police.\nAccording to figures from the Independent Office for Police Conduct of deaths in custody over the last 10 years, black people are more than twice as likely to die than population demographics would indicate.\nInquest found that, between 1990 and 2017, 184 African, Asian and minority ethnic individuals died in police custody.\nThe fact that black people and black men in particular are disproportionately likely to die as a result of police use of force or restraint raises “serious questions of institutional racism as a contributory factor in their deaths.”\nAs the world mourns the public lynching of George Floyd, the British government must take this opportunity to address the severe racial disparities in our own criminal justice system.\nNow is the time to be accountable and support the global Black Lives Matter movement to end the severe class and racial inequalities which exist across the world.\nThe question facing those of us who seek to end the disproportionate suffering of black people at the hands of the police and across society as a whole, is how can we transform Black Lives Matter from a crucial slogan to a reality of daily life?\nThis means reforming Britain’s racist criminal justice system. This means justice for the victims of racialised state violence, including Grenfell Tower and the Windrush Generation.\nIt means that when a black person dies in police custody — as they disproportionately do — the incident is thoroughly investigated, and the police involved face justice.\nIt means transforming our British education system to teach the truthful education about colonialism, imperialism and the transatlantic slave trade.\nIt means an end to racist policies like no recourse to public funds and the hostile environment.\nUltimately, it means an end to empty platitudes. It is up to those in power to prove with their actions that Black Lives Matter, not just to say that they do.\nAnd it is up to all of us to continue supporting this movement, so that racial inequalities of all kinds are eradicated, and that we can build a world that works for all of us.\nAs the radical Angela Davis said: “If we don’t take seriously the ways in which racism is embedded in structures of institutions, if we assume that there must be an identifiable racist who is the perpetrator, then we won’t ever succeed in eradicating racism.”\nNow is the time for us to interrogate our systems of government so that we can end the global scourge of racism, no matter what form it takes.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-new-nhs-bill-opens-the-door-to-yet-more-privatisation/content_680.html": "The new NHS Bill opens the door to yet more privatisation\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe dangers of sliding towards a US-style private insurance healthcare system cannot be overstated, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLIKE everyone living in Britain, I feel deeply indebted to all healthcare workers, whose dedication has helped us through the pandemic.\nI am blown away by the selflessness of those who dedicate their lives and put themselves at risk to help others.\nTragically, according to the Office for National Statistics, more than 850 NHS and care workers have died after exposure to Covid-19, amid a shameful failure to provide them with suitable personal protective equipment (PPE).\nAny reasonable government would ensure that those who have contributed most to our national effort receive a fair compensation for their heroic efforts, including a 15 per cent pay rise. Yet sadly, we do not have a reasonable government.\nNot only is the government’s paltry public-sector pay rise insufficient to make up for years of below-inflation real-terms pay freezes.\nBut when it claimed to be introducing a public-sector pay rise in July 2020 in recognition of their help in tackling Covid-19, it neglected to include many of the NHS workers who had put their wellbeing on the line to keep our society going over the last year.\nIn March 2021 the Prime Minister defended a despicable 1 per cent pay rise to NHS staff\nThis reveals the fundamental hypocrisy of this government. It does not matter how many government officials applauded NHS staff in front of television cameras if they then refuse to pay them a fair wage.\nEven before this crisis, many NHS workers had endured a 20 per cent real-terms pay cut due to the Tories’ cruel, needless, ideologically driven austerity agenda.\nA poll by the Royal College of Nursing indicates that many are considering leaving the health service and there are about 40,000 nursing vacancies in England alone.\nThis staffing crisis is exacerbated by the government’s nonsensical decision to scrap the student bursary, which is putting off many working-class young people who may otherwise have considered becoming one of the next generation of nurses.\nThis demonstrates the contempt with which this government holds health workers.\nWhile senior civil servants, National Crime Agency workers and members of the judiciary receive a 2.5 per cent pay bump — which the PCS trade union argues is insufficient and inequitably distributed — our amazing nurses are offered an insulting 1 per cent “increase” which is in fact a real-terms pay cut.\nThese divide-and-rule tactics are straight out of the Conservative playbook.\nWe must oppose these attempts to pit sections of the working class against each other. Because by standing together, united, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.\nWe can no longer live in a society where health workers are underpaid, front-line workers are undervalued, or our NHS is starved of funding.\nJobs that, before this crisis were wrongly decried by the government as low-skilled are now rightly recognised by the public as essential.\nThis must be reflected with a significant restructuring of our economy along the lines of justice, with pay rises for those who we clearly cannot live without.\nTrade unions, including Unite, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB, Unison and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, have been lobbying the government to bring about a pay rise for NHS staff before the end of the year.\nThe left must continue to stand in full solidarity with all trade unionists and NHS workers who are calling for the fair and equitable treatment that NHS staff deserve.\nThis week, Parliament debates the deeply worrying Health and Care Bill.\nSir David Nicholson, former chief executive of NHS England, has warned that the government’s impending shake-up of the NHS could prompt a lot of staff who are already exhausted by Covid-19 to quit.\nThis will have a devastating impact on the more than five million people who are currently on England’s NHS waiting list.\nThe Bill fails on every conceivable level. It introduces an increased rationing of healthcare, with a specific limit on the amount of money available for NHS services within an integrated care systems area.\nThis budget hawkism risks people being forced to go without the treatment they need or else having to pay for it.\nOn top of this, the Health and Care Bill also puts vulnerable patients at risk by making it easier to discharge them before they have been assessed.\nThis is the worst possible way to address the bed shortage crisis that is of the government’s own making.\nThe legislation also makes virtually no mention of social care, despite Boris Johnson promising in his very first speech as prime minister that his government would “fix the crisis in social care once and for all, with a clear plan that we have prepared.”\nYet his government has remained silent on one of the most pressing issues of our time, with older and vulnerable people across the country suffering from a fragmented and underfunded care system.\nPerhaps most worrying of all is that the Bill enshrines profit-seeking companies at the heart of our NHS.\nIn its current form, private companies will be able to sit on integrated care systems’ boards, where they will be given decision-making powers over people’s care and how NHS money is spent.\nThe new Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, will need to be constantly reminded that he does not represent his former employers at JP Morgan or any billionaires who wish to sell our NHS to the highest bidder. He is now the health secretary, the custodian of our health service that was built by the working class.\nThe NHS is a gleaming beacon of human achievement, the embodiment of socialist, universal principles in which everyone — no matter their position in society — benefits equally.\nSince the disastrous 2012 Health and Social Care Act, NHS outsourcing and privatisation has been incentivised.\nClinical commissioning groups are under pressure to outsource and, in 2015, private firms won 40 per cent of all contracts.\nIn the last five years alone, private companies were handed £15 billion worth of NHS contracts. Some 18 per cent of healthcare bids now go to private providers.\nThe Health and Care bill does nothing to address the cronyism witnessed during the Covid-19 pandemic with contracts handed to unaccountable private providers without the necessary transparency or scrutiny.\nIn many cases the NHS logo is co-opted by private providers such as with the disastrous, so-called ‘NHS Test and Trace’, handed £37 billion of NHS Covid-19 funds and which is predominantly run by Serco. Yet the direction of travel under this government has been towards a fragmented, underfunded and increasingly privatised healthcare system. It’s a rotten system when Serco’s CEO is paid a staggering £4.9 million, yet nurses who risked their lives to save others are only worth a mere 1% pay rise – or real terms pay cut.\nThe dangers of sliding towards a US-style private insurance healthcare system cannot be overstated.\nResearch by The Commonwealth Fund in 2018 found that nearly half of working-age Americans, a staggering 87 million people, were either underinsured or had no coverage at all.\nRather than spending money on doctors, nurses, mental health specialists, dentists and other professionals who provide services to people and improve their lives, the US wastes hundreds of billions of dollars a year on profiteering, huge executive compensation packages and outrageous administrative costs.\nDespite widespread myths regarding the efficiency of the “free” market, the US state spends nearly double what we spend on healthcare for generally worse healthcare results.\nIt is common sense that, in services essential to human life, profiteering and corporate greed should be off-limits.\nIt is up to all us who value healthcare as a human right to protect our most treasured public institution.\nRather than downgrading hospitals, including the Leicester General in my constituency, and extending NHS privatisation, the government must properly fund all hospitals in Leicester and across Britain.\nWe must say, loudly and clearly, that our NHS is not for sale.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-two-child-benefit-cap-shames-our-country-its-time-to-end-it/content_618.html": "The Two-child benefit cap shames our country – it’s time to end it\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nEnding the cap would immediately lift some 250,000 children out of poverty. For Labour not to make ending it a policy is madness, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nBRITAIN is a country shamed by the poverty of its children — and it’s a scandal that there is no urgent political will or interest in changing one of the main drivers of this catastrophe.\nSome 4.2 million of our children are living in poverty — one in three of our kids — with almost three million of them in “deep” poverty, whose families earn less than half of the median income.\nThis number, in the midst of an induced cost-of-living emergency and soaring interest rates, is only going in one direction, yet there seems little parliamentary interest in stopping the rise.\nThe cruel two-child benefit cap is at the heart of this appalling situation — analysis by the LSE’s Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion suggests that rising child poverty has been driven almost entirely by increasing poverty among households with three or more children.\nThe Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) agrees, pointing out that 400,000 families and 1.5 million children have been driven below the poverty line, or deeper into poverty, by the cap — and the Resolution Foundation notes that nearly half of families with three or more children are in poverty, up from a third in 2012.\nThis cap costs affected families on average almost £3,000 a year and in my constituency of Leicester East, child poverty was already endemic before this additional horror was imposed.\nIn 2020, long before the cost-of-living emergency, 42 per cent of Leicester East children were in poverty and more than half in some neighbourhoods.\nAcross the city, three out of 10 children live in poverty — and around 44,000 across Leicestershire. Of these, more than two-thirds face worse hardship because of this inhumane policy.\nThe government’s favourite mantra is that work lifts people out of poverty, but this is simply untrue — across the UK, 57 per cent of families affected by this cap have at least one parent in work.\nIn Leicester East, where low pay and exploitative employment are a major issue that I have been fighting for a long time, it’s even higher — two-thirds of families hit are in work.\nIn our broken system, work is no guarantee of escaping this intentional poverty trap.\nThe scale of the issue facing British families because of the benefit cap is huge: according to CPAG, the difference between the cost of raising a child and the level of support received by those families is more than £7,000 a year, an increase of £938 in 2022 compared to the year before.\nThis situation was worsened by the government’s decision to end the £20 uplift for universal credit claimants in the middle of the cost-of-living emergency — and the government’s temporary support during the crisis has also been shown to go proportionally less to families with more children.\nCPAG’s research also discovered that 95 per cent of families had been unable to afford at least some essential basics because of the cap — a staggering 88 per cent had been unable to afford food or clothes, despite working every available hour.\nAnd according to the Food Foundation, in September last year, more than a quarter of our children are in constant food insecurity — this was an increase of more than 50 per cent in just five months. The scale of the suffering caused by this conscious cruelty is appalling.\nThe consequences of that suffering are also enormous for children and their parents.\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics said last autumn that its members are frequently treating malnourished children — and that children in poverty are 72 per cent more likely to develop long-term illness, further entrenching the disadvantage that millions of children face through no fault of their own.\nLikewise, the Marmot review found that the cold and unhealthy living conditions of poor children lead to lung damage, underdevelopment and psychological damage.\nThe consequences of this injustice are seen daily on the front line. The Institute of Health Visiting says that 84 per cent of front-line health visitors report an increase in the children they are seeing with speech, language and communication delay, damaging children’s life prospects educationally as well.\nThis harm continues beyond early years. A Survation poll by the Chefs in Schools charity found that more than eight out of 10 primary school teachers reported children coming to their class hungry, leaving children lacking energy, struggling to concentrate and learn, and prone to anxiety, stigma and disruptive behaviour.\nIn any nation, this situation would be a scandal. In one of the world’s “wealthiest” nations, it is unforgivable and criminal — it is going to get worse unless there is a fundamental change in British politics, so it’s deeply disappointing — and some would argue shameful — that Keir Starmer said, as recently as this week, that the Labour Party will definitely not end the cap, when in government.\nThe Resolution Foundation’s 2023 Living Standards Outlook notes that “child poverty in 2027-28 is forecast to be the highest since 1998-99, with 170,000 more children in poverty than in 2021-22 … child poverty for families with three or more children is set to hit 55 per cent in 2027-28, and 77 per cent of children in families with four or more children will be in poverty by 2027-28.”\nThe government’s policy is also inherently discriminatory against women and racialised groups. While 5 per cent of the families affected by the cap are headed by a male single parent, 40 per cent are run by a female lone parent.\nHigh rates of poverty among black, African, Caribbean and Asian families — double the rate among white families — means that they are far more likely to be among benefit claimants hit by this cap.\nAdded to this, of course, is the brutal, demeaning and offensive requirement for women to prove rape if they need to claim for a third child.\nEven leaving aside the inhumanity of this policy, it is economically counterproductive. While it would cost only around £1.3 billion to end the injustice of the cap, CPAG estimates that the cap costs the UK almost £40bn a year in lost revenues and consequential costs of the poverty it inflicts.\nThere is simply no justification for it, not even a cold-hearted penny-pinching one. The two-child benefit cap is intentionally cruel, devastating for children and their families and doesn’t even save money. The aim is to punish and control working-class families through increasing social and material losses.\nEnding the cap would immediately lift some 250,000 children out of poverty. If the Tories are uninterested in helping them, for Labour not to make ending it a policy is madness: many of the worst-hit constituencies are in the former Labour seats in the Midlands and north of England that Labour needs to win back.\nOn average, 12 per cent of children living in those seats are suffering because of the cap, significantly higher than in other constituencies.\nA commitment to ending the cap would also help Labour among racialised groups, where trust in Labour is at an all-time low. Compared to the least diverse communities, almost twice as many children in ethnically diverse communities are hit by the cap — again reflecting the inherent discrimination of the policy.\nIt is surely time — long past time — for this cruel and shameful cap to cease and for Britain to end its shame of the way it treats its children, its poor and its vulnerable. We must demand nothing less.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

The abhorrent proposal is based on the Australian system, which is the worst and least humane template to emulate. Indeed, Home Secretary Priti Patel recently recruited the former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer to review the country’s border force, weeks after he had urged Britain to adopt a hard line on asylum-seekers arriving by boat.\nAustralia has spent £5.5 billion sending over 3,000 asylum-seekers offshore since July 2013, equating to over £1.7 million per asylum-seeker — over a hundred times more expensive than our current asylum system.\nOne of its two centres has shut down, the majority of people have been transferred back to Australia and people haven’t been sent offshore since 2014. At least 12 people have died in the Australian offshore camps and there have been hundreds of reports of child abuse and self-harm.\nThe Prime Minister and Home Secretary state that the proposal will act as a deterrent for asylum-seekers arriving by boat or dinghy. Yet this policy will do nothing to clamp down on trafficking gangs; instead, it further penalises their victims.\nThe fact that the government wishes to deter people fleeing war, violence and persecution is immoral — yet this policy does not even achieve that callous aim.\nMatthew Rycroft, the civil servant in charge of the Home Office, admitted that there is no evidence that the policy will act as a deterrent and therefore it’s unlikely to provide value for money.\nThe cost of the policy is eye-watering, with the government paying Rwanda £120 million up front as well as an additional £30,000 per person.\nYet the financial and practical failings of the proposal are insignificant when compared to its utter moral failings. This trade with Rwanda, forcing people offshore and treating them as human cargo, is shameful and can be regarded as nothing less than glorified human trafficking.\nThe government must remember that there is no such thing as an illegal asylum-seeker. The policy is designed to stoke the flames of hate and to dehumanise people fleeing unimaginable suffering. It erodes the basic human decency upon which governance should be operated.\nGillian Triggs, assistant secretary-general at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, said the scheme was an “egregious breach of international and refugee law.”\nBritain is a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. This means Britain is required to grant asylum to a refugee, who is defined in that convention as someone who “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.”\nBritain is also bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, which “prevents Britain from sending someone to a country where there is a real risk they may be exposed to torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”\nThere are also grave concerns regarding Rwanda’s suitability to host asylum-seekers, as Amnesty International and other human rights organisations have criticised the country’s record on human rights.\nFor instance, in 2020, over a thousand people applied for asylum in Britain on the basis of sexual orientation. Yet the government now plans to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda where, according to the British government’s own website, LGBT+ people report societal discrimination and abuse and their safety cannot be guaranteed.\nThe plans show the government is happy to reduce the lives and safety of vulnerable people to political bargaining chips in a desperate attempt to save its own skin. According to widespread reports, the Rwanda offshore processing policy was just one part of a series of policy announcements, codenamed Operation Red Meat, to help relieve pressure on the embattled Prime Minister. Other proposals included a plan to put the military in charge of stopping people from crossing the Channel in small boats to reach Britain.\nDowning Street policy “experts” have also looked into using powerful sonic weapons to turn back the boats. This would use long-range acoustic devices, such as those used in the US for crowd control.\nThese sound cannons emit noise powerful enough to induce vomiting. This is an abhorrent proposal that we must fight tooth and nail against ever being implemented. Indeed, we must organise to ensure that no more of the “red meat” proposals are introduced.\nA record 28,300 migrants and refugees attempted to cross the Channel to Britain last year, more than three times the 8,400 who crossed in 2020. With endless wars and climate catastrophe there is no sign of a decline this year — the number of people crossing last month was more than double the total for January 2021.\nThe only humane response is to open safe and legal routes for asylum. Yet the Home Secretary’s recent asylum system overhaul lacks basic humanity and represent the latest step in this government’s pernicious demonisation of asylum-seekers. It has rightly been criticised by human rights organisations and religious leaders.\nThe British government has persistently been warned that if they do not open safe and legal routes for people to practice their legal right to claim asylum, deaths at sea are unavoidable. Yet the government has proceeded to close the few legal avenues that exist, such as the right to family reunion.\nContrary to the mistruths peddled by right-wing commentators, asylum-seekers do not arrive in Britain to leech off the state — Asylum Support Allowance is a mere £40.85 per week. And far from the myths propagated by the Home Secretary, it is also far from the case that Britain is overwhelmed with asylum-seekers, with Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and France registering far more asylum applicants.\nIndeed, Home Office decision-making has collapsed under Patel — delays and incompetence mean the department is making 50 per cent fewer asylum decisions than five years ago and fewer asylum decisions than countries with smaller populations such as Belgium or the Netherlands, let alone comparably sized neighbours including France or Germany.\nIn the sixth-richest country in the world, there is no reason why we cannot provide a humane pathway towards stability and dignity for everyone in this country. We must also remember that 83 per cent of refugees worldwide live in developing regions — not industrialised countries — which further reflects the grim, unbalanced nature of global power dynamics that are a legacy of colonialism and imperialism.\nThe Rwanda offshore processing policy is the latest example of the government’s mistreatment and demonisation of refugees and asylum-seekers. It has sadly been a tried and tested technique of reactionary governments to gild their destructive administrations with a toxic veneer of appearing “strong” on immigration.\nHowever, this divide and rule tactic has only ever brought misery to all working people, regardless of their country of birth. It is not asylum-seekers and refugees who cause poverty and division, but rather the elite who punish and demonise them. As Tony Benn said “the way a government treats refugees is very instructive because it shows you how they would treat the rest of us if they thought they could get away with it.”\nWe must oppose this callous policy, fight for a humane immigration system and stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the victims of this government’s brutal agenda.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

They should be protected.\n“If people can be in their house under lockdown, it shows there is no need for a detention centre.\n“They should all be shut down. These immigrants have been forced to flee from persecution and should be protected, not tortured. Our fight continues. No justice, no peace!”\nLabour MP Claudia Webbe said: “Yarl’s Wood has come to be synonymous with the violent, institutionalised racism and sexism that has been hardwired into our immigration system.\n“The strength and bravery of those who are in or have left detention is a source of constant inspiration and living proof that – together – we can build a fairer world.”\nMs Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, called on the government to abolish indefinite detention and repeal the 2014 Immigration Act to end the “destructive demonisation” of migrants and asylum-seekers.\nThe Home Office said that it would continue to seek the removal of those who were in the country illegally.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-must-oppose-the-governments-divide-and-rule-tactics/content_746.html": "We must oppose the government’s divide and rule tactics\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nFear-mongering over Muslim celebrations spreading Covid-19 and an invasion of illegal immigrants across the Channel must be resisted, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE concept of “divide and rule” has been a tried and tested conservative technique, stretching back to the days of formal empire when colonial powers would pit indigenous groups against each other as part of their brutal, extractive regimes.\nIn recent weeks, we have seen our Tory government engage in multiple examples of this brutal tool of governance.\nThe first is the government’s farcical public-sector pay increase, which claimed to be “in recognition of their help in tackling Covid-19.”\nYet not only is the paltry pay rise insufficient to make up for years of below inflation real-terms pay freezes, but it neglects to include the NHS workers who have put their wellbeing on the line to keep our society going in recent months.\nThe dedication, selflessness and bravery of health workers have carried us through the coronavirus crisis. Tragically, more than 500 NHS and care workers have died after exposure to Covid-19, amid a shameful failure to provide them with adequate personal protective equipment.\nAny reasonable government would ensure that those who have contributed most to our national effort receive fair compensation for their heroic efforts. Yet sadly, we do not have a reasonable government.\nUnderstandably, this has provoked mass outrage. Saturday saw a national day of protest in which health workers came together and called on the government to recognise their immense contribution to our society. All power and solidarity to those fighting for these basic workplace rights.\nThese divide and rule tactics are straight out of the Conservative playbook, and we must oppose these attempts to pit sections of the working class against each other.\nAnother example of this destructive strategy is the government’s attempt to distract from their many failures by blaming marginalised groups.\nThis was demonstrated by a media storm over the weekend, which saw an appalling cycle of demonisation against migrants and asylum-seekers.\nWhat began as a hate-filled tweet from Nigel Farage quickly became a headline media talking point, with government ministers piling in to portray the arrival of a handful of desperate people as the source of our fraying society.\nThis is depressingly familiar. A large part of the conservatives’ “success” over the last decade in widening inequality and slashing our public safety net has come through scapegoating migrants — from arbitrary net migration targets to the Windrush scandal.\nIt is ludicrous to suggest that a small number of vulnerable migrants pose a threat to our security, economy or social life — yet this divisive idea is peddled as a convenient distraction by the same people who are responsible for the huge upward transfer of wealth in recent years.\nWe on the left must be clear — attacks on the working class come from the billionaire class who stash their wealth in tax havens, not those fleeing persecution and poverty. Those making the perilous journey across the channel are often arriving from countries where the UK has contributed to their disruption — either by arming current conflicts or through the enduring legacy of colonialism.\nSadly, the government’s divide and rule tactics extend to their attempt to distract from the appalling handling of the coronavirus crisis.\nFor instance, it was outrageous and unacceptable for the government to announce such sweeping changes to social distancing measures on social media at such short notice before one of the largest religious celebrations in the Muslim calendar.\nIt would be unimaginable for the government to make a similar announcement on December 24 to prohibit people at the last possible moment from celebrating Christmas. Yet this was deemed an acceptable way to treat our Muslim community.\nI was also shocked and appalled by the despicable, racist comments made by Craig Whittaker MP, who sought to blame Muslims and migrants for the recent extension of lockdown measures.\nBy failing to condemn Whittaker, the Prime Minister — who has a long history of racist comments — once again demonstrated his personal tolerance for divisiveness. The government should be ashamed at such inflammatory attempts to deflect from its own failures.\nWhen people like Whittaker or members of the right-wing press punch downwards, they let the powerful and those responsible off the hook. At every step in this crisis — from lockdown delay, equipment shortages, care home neglect, testing delays, insufficient data and much more — the government has failed to adequately protect our communities. That’s why we have the most excess deaths of any European country.\nWe on the left cannot allow this government to pit sections of the working class against each other, or to create scapegoats for their disastrous handling of this pandemic.\nIt has never been more important for our communities to come together and unite. We must oppose any attempt to divide us up based on nationality, religion or ethnicity.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_state-sanctioned-gaslighting/content_407.html": "State-sanctioned gaslighting\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report is simply the latest pathetic PR stunt in the government’s divisive culture wars aiming to individualise attitudes to systemic racism, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nDURING the inspiring Black Lives Matter protests last year, I did not see a single sign asking for yet another inquiry into racial inequalities. People of all ages and ethnicities across the country took to the streets to demand long-overdue action, not yet more fact finding.\nThere have been countless reviews and reports into structural racism in recent years; there were 35 recommendations in the Lammy review into criminal justice; there were 110 recommendations in the Angiolini review into deaths in police custody; there were 30 recommendations in the Home Office review into the Windrush Scandal, and 26 in McGregor-Smith’s inquiry into workplace discrimination.\nRather than embarking on another consultation, the government should have introduced these “oven-ready” recommendations. Yet instead, they have been preoccupied with creating a new narrative in which minorities are blamed for the systemic disadvantages they face.\nBy denying the existence of institutional racism, the government’s long-awaited report on race and ethnic disparities was a slap in the face for African, Asian and minority ethnic communities and all those affected by racism.\nThe claim from the report that Britain is a world-leading bastion of racial progress was nothing short of state-sanctioned gaslighting, and the patronising dismissal of young people’s “idealism” was a disgraceful attempt to distract from the government’s failure on issues of equality.\nThe fact that the report dismissed the legacy of slavery as a “Caribbean experience” and even tried to put a positive spin on its brutality demonstrates how utterly unserious the government is about addressing racial inequality.\nThe government’s Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities was doomed from its conception, in which the government’s bad faith approach was abundantly clear. The commission itself was set up by No 10 adviser Munira Mirza who has repeatedly cast doubt on the existence of institutional racism and condemned previous inquiries for fostering a “culture of grievance.”\nShe was also one of the few people to attack the 2016 Lammy review into inequalities in our criminal justice system. Likewise, Tony Sewell, chair of the commission, has long expressed scepticism about the existence of institutional racism and argued that it creates a victim narrative to cover personal failures.\nBy marking its own homework, the government was working backwards from a preconceived conclusion that institutional racism does not exist. Indeed, Boris Johnson’s most senior black adviser, Samuel Kasumu, resigned just days after the report after accusing the government of pursuing a “politics steeped in division.”\nThe report also failed to address or incorporate the views of the public; the government admitted that thousands of individuals and organisations who responded to the consultation used terms such as “systematic,” “systemic,” “structural,” “institutional,” “internalised,” “inherent” and “cultural” racism to describe what they considered to be the cause of ethnic disparities.\nThis proves the falsehood of the government’s claim that there is “no evidence” of institutional racism – as to find such evidence they would only have had to look at the response to their own consultation.\nYet the government cannot wish away the reality of institutional racism. In Britain, the brutality of institutional racism affects us in all walks of life from police use of force to unfair immigration detentions to the disproportionate number of black children who go to bed hungry.\nDiscrimination is deeply ingrained in our social, political, and economic structures. The scourge of institutional racism results in unequal access to quality education, healthy food, liveable wages, and affordable housing – which are the foundations of health and wellbeing.\nIt is beyond dispute that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate impact on African, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Black people disproportionately suffer from police use of force in Britain, are over-represented in the prison population and are more likely to be sent to prison than white offenders. In my home city of Leicester, a black person is five times more likely to be stopped and searched than a white person. Yet the report makes no mention of these realities.\nThe report rightly criticises the use of the acronym “BAME,” but then continues to obfuscate the hugely different experiences of African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nFor instance, the report claims that “education is the single most emphatic success story of the British ethnic minority experience.” Yet severe racial disparities exist across educational attainment, discipline and university admissions.\nFor example, Black Caribbean students are twice as likely as white students to be temporarily excluded from school and nearly three times more likely to be permanently excluded. Two thirds of the current government were privately educated, yet create policies that racially discriminate and plunge millions into poverty; that is not success but theft and privilege. Again, the report obscures these realities.\nThe report’s claims that “socio-economic” factors, not institutional racism, are to blame for severe racial disparities is bitterly ironic. It is true that class and race intersect in a pernicious way, which has been especially apparent in the disproportionate number of African, Asian and minority ethnic workers who have died during this pandemic.\nYet this government of the super-rich has normalised poverty in our communities and overseen an upwards transfer of wealth and power that has enriched the few at the expense of the many. For them to produce a report that preaches the predominance of class issues over racism is beyond parody.\nAfter the inspiring Black Lives Matter protests, it has never been more important for us to learn from the history of racial oppression and to end the injustices that exist to this day. Yet at this historical moment, the government is instead pretending that racism is an individual failing, not a systemic experience which is driven by powerful institutions.\nThe fact that an overtly racist individual, such as Boris Johnson, can ascend to the nation’s highest office is proof enough of the corrosive legacy of empire within the British establishment. It is also somewhat hypocritical of a government led by a man on his third marriage, with an unverified number of children, to publish a report that mentions “family” twice as much as “bias” and identifies “family breakdown as one of the main reasons for poor outcomes.” According to this government, family breakdown is only a problem for poor non-white families, not rich white Etonians.\nGiven the Prime Minister’s long history of racist comments, there remain legitimate concerns regarding his personal commitment to tackling racial inequalities. To assuage these, he could begin by apologising for his repeated use of racist and insensitive language – something he has yet to do. There is a litany of urgent actions that his government could take to show that it is taking this issue seriously.\nIt could implement the recommendations from the existing reviews. It could reform Britain’s racist criminal justice system. It could deliver justice for the victims of racialised state violence, including Grenfell Tower and the Windrush generation.\nThe government must ensure that, when a black person dies in police custody – as they disproportionately do – the incident is thoroughly investigated, and the police involved face justice.\nIt must transform our education system to teach the reality of colonialism, imperialism and the transatlantic slave trade. It must address the severe racial pay gap. It must end racist policies like No Recourse to Public Funds and the hostile environment. Accepting that these are structural problems will be the first step in this process.\nThe report is simply the latest pathetic PR stunt in the government’s divisive culture wars. Its aim to individualise racism and to claim that discrimination is no longer a societal issue is the expression of the Thatcherite dogma that “there is no such thing as society.”\nYet this is a crisis that requires collective solutions. As Fred Hampton put it, we do not fight racism with racism, but with solidarity. That is the mission that faces all of us on the left today, to reject this government’s attempts to divide us up and to fight for a world free of racial and class inequalities.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-brutality-of-modern-racism-cannot-be-separated-from-its-history/content_404.html": "The brutality of modern racism cannot be removed from its history\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nCLAUDIA WEBBE MP welcomes the acquittal of those who toppled the statue honouring the slaver Edward Colston, which sanitised the abhorrent violation of black Africans’ humanity\nTHE acquittal of the Colston Four, the protesters charged with criminal damage after anti-racist campaigners tore down a statue of slave-trader Edward Colston in Bristol, shines a light on the ongoing struggle for equality and justice and the enduring legacy of the transatlantic slave trade.\nThe abhorrent statue of a man responsible for the violent deaths, rape and enslavement of thousands of people was pulled down and thrown into Bristol’s harbourside during the largest mobilisation of anti-racist protest for decades.\nThe trigger for such protest was the brutal police killing of George Floyd in May 2020, in Minneapolis, that shook the world. In its wake came the international mobilisation of the Black Lives Matter movement, the demand for change and the march for justice.\nWith its origins in the United States, it is crucial to understand the Black Lives Matter movement within the context of the centuries of social deprivation and economic extraction endured by generations of African-Americans.\nThe United States has been built on the slavery, dispossession and subjugation of its African-American population. Similar claims can be made of Britain.\nDue to the extent of institutional inequality in Britain, Black Lives Matter’s analysis of systemic racism and structural discrimination also resonated across our country.\nThe protests in Bristol, throughout Britain and around the world were a genuine outpouring of rage against a system that is built upon one of the worst violations of human rights in the history of humanity.\nThe Colston Four of Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford, Sage Willoughby and Jake Skuse — as well as every other protester who removed Colston’s statue — could arguably have been congratulated, not put on trial.\nPredictably, reactionary public figures and Conservative MPs have criticised the vindication of the Colston Four by arguing it validates “mob rule.”\nIndeed, the attorney general, Suella Braverman MP, has said she is “carefully considering” whether to refer the Colston statue case to the court of appeal after the outcry from rightwingers within the Tory Party.\nYet this culture war posturing ignores the long battle in Bristol, including public petitions spanning 30 years, to have the statue removed legally.\nAs Professor David Olusoga argues, the real offence was that a statue to a mass murderer was able to stand for 125 years, not that that it was toppled in the summer of 2020.\nThose defending the statue must reckon with the fact that, during Colston’s involvement with the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692, it is estimated that the company transported over 84,000 African men, women and children to the Caribbean and the rest of the Americas, of whom as many as 19,000 may have died on the journey.\nIt is poetic justice that his statue ended up underwater, emulating the fate that many Africans suffered on board his ships in the middle passage.\nThose who are lamenting the acquittal of the Colston Four wish to distract from the fact that the wealth of Bristol and many other European ports was built on the evil of the transatlantic slave trade.\nColonialism continued that exploitation for another hundred years, and neocolonial forms of extraction and domination exist to this day.\nDuring the slave trade, if one survived the horrors of the journey to be sold, the life expectancy on plantations was only 27 years.\nSlave rebellions were put down with untold brutality and the system of bondage was maintained by arbitrary punishment with slavers having complete impunity from killing or torturing.\nSlave families were destroyed, and every sort of depraved abuse was forced upon men, women and children alike.\nIt is estimated that, until the Abolition of Slavery Act in 1833, Britain transported some 3.1 million Africans to its colonies in the Caribbean, North America and elsewhere.\nTogether with Portugal, the two countries accounted for about 70 per cent of all Africans transported to the Americas. In total approximately 17 million people, excluding those who died during transportation over a period of 400 years, were sold and exploited by Europeans.\nAnd when the British empire did abolish slavery, it provided 46,000 slave owners — among them the ancestors of David Cameron, George Orwell and Graham Greene — with today’s equivalent of £17 billion, which equated to 40 per cent of its national budget at the time.\nThe British government only paid off its obligations to former slave-owning families and organisations in 2015.\nUntil then, in an injustice that heaps insult onto injury, black British taxpayers have been paying to compensate those that imprisoned our ancestors.\nThe brutality of modern racism in Britain cannot be separated from this history. The perverse legacy of slavers such as Colston continues to affect us in all walks of life, from police use of force to unfair immigration detentions to the disproportionate number of black children who go to bed hungry.\nIn Britain, as in the United States, we see statues and monuments used to whitewash this abhorrent history.\nStatues were commissioned by slaveowners all over Britain, and many extravagant country homes were built on the back of slavery itself.\nEdward Colston, who built his fortune on the slave trade then varnished his reputation by donating some of his ill-gotten gains to charity, was one of these benefactors.\nThe removal of his statue was long overdue. There is no moral ambiguity around his legacy, and that of other slaveowners. It is one of pure evil.\nOur cities are littered with monuments to racialised cruelty. A statue to William Beckford still stands in London’s Guildhall, immortalising a man who benefited from holding 3,000 slaves in Jamaica and campaigned against abolition.\nBramshill, the national police training college, is the former home of a Jamaican plantation owner.\nWhile around 70 tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists were removed across the UK after the Colston statue, we have much further to go in ridding our country of these monuments to evil.\nThe movement to decolonise objects of collective memory has been ignited by liberation struggles all over the world, from South Africa where Cecil Rhodes statues have been taken down forcibly due to his role in systematic colonial oppression and the formation of apartheid, to Oxford, where the powerful Rhodes Must Fall campaign has continued to grow.\nRacism benefits from a benign narrative that distances present-day injustices from past oppression.\nIt is our duty to recognise the strong connections between historical and contemporary injustices.\nThe invisibility of those who paid with their suffering and their lives for the fortunes amassed by slaver owners and traders is part of the problem.\nThe victims have been erased from the narrative of history. This exclusion must end and their true place in history be restored — starting with a national curriculum which celebrates black people’s contribution to Britain and teaches the true, brutal history of the British empire.\nThere must also be a full review of statues and monuments which glorify perpetrators of historic atrocities, the legacies of which persist to this day.\nOf course, we need more than symbolic victories. The economic and social inequalities that plague Britain must be urgently addressed with a radical policy agenda, funded by taxes on the super-rich.\nYet present-day injustices are inseparable from the historical origins of racism and oppression.\nIn order to overcome them, we must challenge how we remember our past. The Colston Four, and the anti-racist movement they were part of, represent an important step in this struggle.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

They failed to pay £3,674 to 1 workers between September 2014 and March 2017.\nMagnum Care Limited, a residential nursing company, failed to pay £22,711 to 174 workers between March 2014 and June 2018\nMaryland Chicken, the trading name for Yarr Ltd, failed to pay £21,090 to 16 workers between September 2016 and August 2018.\nCSP Recruitment, the trading name for Nourish Training Ltd, failed to pay £9,262 to 81 workers between October 2014 and March 2016.\nMaryland Chicken, trading name for Muzzy Foods Ltd, failed to pay £3,244 to 6 workers between August 2016 and August 2018.\nApparel Trading Ltd, a women’s clothing factory, failed to pay £2,671 to 51 workers between April 2017 and September 2017.\nLeicester Motors Limited, a garage, failed to pay £1,981 to 2 workers between April 2017 and July 2018.\nMaryland Chicken, trading name for Namara Foods Ltd, failed to pay £1,135 to 6 workers between December 2017 and August 2019.\nThe government said they are sending the message that “no employer is exempt” from paying their workers the statutory minimum wage.\nClaudia Webbe has “condemned” the four companies within her constituency after they were named and shamed and she has called on the government to go further in “tackling wage theft and exploitation” in Leicester and across the country.\nShe said: “Whilst I welcome this investigation and strongly condemn the four shameful employers in Leicester East, I fear that the government’s enquiry does not go nearly far enough.\n“We know from first-hand accounts and other formal investigations that there are many, many more than four companies in Leicester East – and seven in Leicester – that underpay their workers.\n“It is especially incredulous that only one Leicester-based garment industry employer was named in this investigation, when multiple other inquiries over more than a decade have reported widespread and endemic wage theft in Leicester – with workers paid as little as £2 an hour. The British Retail Consortium, for instance, estimate that workers in Leicester’s apparel manufacturing are underpaid a staggering total of £2.1 million per week.”\nAmong the ways in which workers were underpaid, were deductions that reduce minimum wage pay such as leaving workers out of pocket to comply with the dress code; unpaid working time for things like mandatory training, trial shifts or travel time; failing to pay the correct rate to apprentices, and not increasing National Minimum Wage pay in line with government rises; or paying the wrong minimum wage rate, e.g. paying a 23 year old the 21-22 year old rate.\nShe continued: “The government must therefore build on this and do much more to investigate and prosecute the underpayment of the minimum wage. A start would be to reverse funding cuts to HMRC, who conducted this limited investigation over five years.\n“Above all else, it is vital that the government raises the Minimum Wage to £15 an hour. Because over the last decade of conservative rule, in-work poverty has increased to the point that a job no longer guarantees a route out of hardship.\n“The government’s paltry minimum wage increase scheduled for next year is still below what the Living Wage Foundation calculates as being essential to afford the necessities of life. We need a genuinely liveable minimum wage, not poverty pay wrapped up in misleading rhetoric. And we need it to be properly enforced, in Leicester and across the country.”\nSince 2015, the budget for minimum wage enforcement has doubled with the government having ordered employers to repay over £100 million to 1 million workers.\nMinister for Labour Markets Paul Scully said: “We want workers to know that we’re on their side and they must be treated fairly by their employers, which is why paying the legal minimum wage should be non-negotiable for businesses.”\n“Today’s 208 businesses, whatever their size, should know better than to short-change hard-working employees, regardless of whether it was intentional or not.\n“With Christmas fast approaching, it’s more important than ever that cash is not withheld from the pockets of workers. So don’t be a scrooge – pay your staff properly.”\nLeicestershireLive contacted the businesses for comment, but did not receive any replies. They have since had to pay back what they owe to staff and also face significant financial penalties of up to 200% of what was owed, which are paid to the government.\nThe investigations by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs concluded between 2014 and 2019.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_leicester-politicians-reject-boris-johnsons-attempt-to-blame-mayor-for-factory-exploitation/content_485.html": "Leicester politicians reject Boris Johnson’s attempt to blame mayor for factory exploitation.\nThe Prime Minister must take responsibility for these failures.’ says Claudia Webbe MP for Leicester East.\nPoliticians in Leicester have refuted and criticised Boris Johnson’s attempt to blame the local mayor for the exploitation of workers within the city’s garment industry.\nThe sector has once again fallen under scrutiny after The Sunday Timesreported that workers in a Leicester-based factory were making clothes destined for Boohoo, the fast fashion retailer for as little as £3.50 pounds an hour.\nThe report also claimed that few measures had been put in place to prevent the potential spread of coronavirus among workers.\nPrevious investigations, stretching back to 2017, have highlighted the long-term issue of labour exploitation in Leicester.\nOnly last year, the Environmental Audit Committee, chaired by former MP Mary Creagh, published a report setting out wide-ranging recommendations to end the era of throwaway fashion by addressing environmental and labour practices – all of which the government rejected.\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister suggested that responsibility for the ongoing issue of modern slavery and exploitation in Leicester’s factories lay with Sir Peter Soulsby, the city major.\nWhen asked during PMQs how the government intended to address such issues in light of the recent revelations, Mr Johnson said: “We hope it’d be the Labour mayor of Leicester who would stand up for the interests of the workforce in his community.”\nThe comments have drawn a sharp response from Leicester’s authorities, who insisted that, as a result of government inaction, local councils “have no powers” to monitor working conditions within factories or enforce the minimum wage.\nClaudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, the epicentre of the city’s latest outbreak, said that the PM “must take responsibility for these failures”.\n“Boris Johnson sought to blame the exploitation of workers in Leicester’s garment industry on our local city mayor,” she said. “Yet his government has known about this issue for years, rejected all the recommendations of a 2019 Environmental Audit Committee report into this issue, and slashed the funding of the Health and Safety Executive.\n“I share the dismay of many that the government has long been aware of instances of exploitation yet failed to act.\n“It is appalling that the exploited labour of the workers of Leicester East is helping to finance extravagant corporate salaries at Boohoo and other corporate giants.\n“I urge the government to prove that it prioritises public health over private profit by beginning to take workers’ rights seriously.”\nAdam Clarke, Leicester deputy city mayor for environment and transportation, told The Independent that the persistent issue of exploitation within the region’s factories “has to come back to the poor response by central government”.\nHe said that Leicester City Council had contributed to a 2017 parliamentary review of human rights within business, which would have granted councils powers to close down premises where workers were unsafe or being exploited. “This was also rejected by the government,” Mr Clarke said.\n“As a result, councils have no powers to check on working conditions inside a building, to enforce the minimum wage, or to monitor the legality of the workforce. Had those recommendations been acted upon, we would be in a far better position now.”\nThe deputy mayor also defended Sir Peter’s record in tackling non-compliance within the textiles supply chain, pointing to the establishment of a local programme that, since September 2018, has worked alongside a number of national enforcement bodies – including the Home Office’s Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority.\n“This has been done despite years of austerity, meaning ourselves and all the agencies which have enforcement powers to tackle this problem have had wave after wave of cuts to much-needed funding and resources.\n“We want to see a plan for a single enforcement authority as soon as possible.”\nThere are an estimated 1,500 garment manufacturing businesses in the city employing around 10,000 people, the majority of whom are women from African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nA recent study by HMRC found that, over a six-year period, a quarter of all UK textile factories caught failing to pay the minimum wage were based in Leicester, with some textile factories reportedly offering less than £3.50 an hour.\nIn a letter to PM, Ms Webbe called for a strengthening of the Modern Slavery Act and for local authorities to be granted the power to proactively intervene in unsafe workplaces. The MP also demanded a public inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 cases and fatalities among migrant and low-income workers.\nIt comes as Boohoo announced it is launching an independent review into its supply chain after it was alleged staff are earning less than the minimum wage amid unsafe working conditions.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, management said the board was “shocked and appalled by the recent allegations”, adding that it was “committed to doing everything in our power to rebuild the reputation of the textile manufacturing industry in Leicester”.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Businesses have also been affected by the loss of trade.\n“Residents have also spoken of their ideas formed from conspiracy theories being circulated, and they have shown me vile hate material sent to them through social media designed to stoke divisions, fear their neighbours and provoke a reaction based on hate.\n“Leicester East is one of the most poverty-stricken areas of the country. Both child poverty and in-work poverty are very high.”\nMs Webbe said there are high levels of inequality and a lack of high-quality jobs, with organisations to help those struggling “long disappeared with austerity.”\n“It is time for the government to issue a statement and take seriously the politics of division and to stand against those who wish to pit communities against each other, which distracts from the real causes of inequality and injustice,” she added.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-governments-war-on-refugees-is-state-sponsored-fascism-in-all-but-name/content_267.html": "The Government’s war on Refugees is state-sponsored facism now in all but name\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Illegal Migration Bill is not only horrific and cruel to those seeking asylum — it is a direct threat to the rights of every person in Britain and sets us on course to becoming a rogue state, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nThis week, the Tory Party’s horrific anti-migrant Bill is in its second stage in Parliament — and it is truly frightening that such an appalling piece of legislation is progressing at lightning speed, with this second reading, a mere six days after it was introduced.\nThis is less than a year after the last significant changes under the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, yet there has been no public consultation or pre-legislative scrutiny.\nThe Illegal Migration Bill is yet another step toward Britain effectively becoming a rogue state. The document begins with an admission by Home Secretary Suella Braverman that her legislation is not compatible with Britain’s human rights obligations and international law.\nBraverman has tried to blur the truth by claiming in her introductory statement to the Bill that she is “unable” to say it conforms to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), but it is very clear that if the government’s lawyers had told her that it did or even might, she would be trumpeting it — yet despite this admission, she says she wants MPs to go along with it anyway, accomplices in a pre-planned breach of international law.\nThe ECHR is often misrepresented by the Tories and their media allies as if it was imposed on us by the EU to protect criminals and restrict our freedoms — but the fact is that it was drafted by Britain and protects the rights of my constituents in Leicester East and of every one of us.\nThe Bill is not just frightening for refugees, but for all of us, because it sets a precedent that the government can simply choose to derogate our human rights — and can do so with almost no route to legal challenge, as the Bill is worded to put the government above the law, even when it “screws up.”\nNot even children are safe. If the Bill becomes law, the Home Secretary doesn’t have to deport unaccompanied children under the terms of the new legislation — but is free to choose to do so anyway.\nThis is monstrous legislation and there are no assurances from the Conservative government that they’ll protect child refugees, even if they’re not obliged to.\nAnd don’t be fooled, while the government disguises the Bill under its dog-whistle “stop the boats” slogan, this legislation is designed to give the government the power to pick and choose which people, from which countries and regions can apply for asylum at all — whether they come by boat or not.\nThis is racist legislation. While people from Ukraine receive an open invitation, other regions are left with no legal or “safe route” to come to Britain, and this Bill seeks to make sure they never do.\nThe Bill will render refugees automatically ineligible for asylum if they arrive here without having obtained permission beforehand and apply for asylum — and surely nobody is foolish enough to think the Tories will issue that permission to all cultures and geographies equally.\nSo, a person escaping danger by obtaining, for example, a tourist visa who applies for asylum on arrival, is already disqualified.\nThis gives the government an effective veto. If the Conservative government doesn’t want asylum-seekers from Syria, for example, then they simply don’t give them permission to come and apply — and anyone who gets here by any other means is ineligible before they even arrive.\nThe United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) agrees with this assessment, going as far as to say that the Bill stops all asylum claims in Britain. Ironically, in the Bill, the Tories point a finger at other nations who are signatories to the human rights convention but are “derogating” their responsibilities — in a Bill in which the Home Secretary admits she wants Britain to derogate its obligations.\nThe government has even worded the Bill to put those it categorises as ineligible outside existing British asylum legislation. The Bill makes it a duty to deport potential victims of torture who arrive in Britain through irregular means, even if they are too vulnerable to be deported.\nA declaration of ineligibility does not count as a refused application, so any right of appeal that refugees would have had against bad decisions on asylum applications is eliminated, except in extremely limited circumstances with a very high legal bar.\nAnd that’s not the only part of this legislation with no right of appeal. The Bill gives the government the right to detain people for up to 28 days without appeal or permission to apply for immigration bail — and even if the government is found to have acted wrongly, the wording rules that out as a reason for the courts to find it acted beyond its powers.\nIt’s clear, on an honest reading, that the Bill is an attack on internationally protected legal rights — and that should worry the people of this country as much as those from elsewhere.\nFrom Braverman’s admission that it doesn’t comply with our treaty obligations, the Bill goes on to explicitly state that its purpose is to exclude certain human rights entitlements from the asylum process.\nThe Bill is also a move by the government to put itself and its agents above the law — something else that should worry us all. As the Bill makes clear, even errors in detention decisions are “not liable to be questioned… in court.”\n“The powers of the immigration officer or the Secretary of State are not to be regarded as having been exceeded by reason of any error made in reaching the decision… no application for judicial review may be made.”\nThus, the Bill prevents a judge from making an order in a judicial review claim to prevent a potentially unlawful deportation.\nThirteen years of successive Conservative governments have already attacked the foundations of human rights in this country, targeting both our rights to protest and to withdraw our labour. While this Bill is directed at asylum seekers, in essence, it’s a continuation of the ongoing assault on the rights of every person in this country.\nThe “stop the boats” slogan serves to whip up anti-immigrant sentiment and discourage some people from looking more closely at the details: in reality, we will all be harmed by this law.\nThe late, great Tony Benn famously said that we should watch how a government treats refugees because it’s how it will treat British citizens if it can get away with it. Now the Tories are trying to get away with it — and we’re seeing the government attacking refugees as a means of eroding the rights of British citizens as well.\nThis government wants to ignore international and human rights law to set the stage for a wider assault on all of us. If the Tories succeed, they will exploit this Bill as a precedent. If they can set aside human rights in one instance, they can do so again and again in wider and wider settings.\nFar from protecting the people of Britain, the Bill will dangerously undermine the rights and protections on which we rely.\nBritain is already on a slide towards fascism and to becoming a failed state: this nation’s political class is corrupt, and the vast majority of the media are neither able nor willing to hold those in power to account, instead of parroting government lines and amplifying state propaganda.\nWith the so-called Illegal Migration Bill, the Tories are steepening the slope and greasing the surface, so we slide faster still — and without even the imperfect protection of the judicial system to impede them.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_action-in-solidarity-with-palestine-deserves-our-full-support/content_351.html": "Action in solidarity with Palestine deserves our full support\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\n75 years on, the Nakba is a continuing process of occupation and oppression, not a one-off event — so the campaign to end Elbit Systems’ presence in Britain is both necessary and justified, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHIS month marks the 75th anniversary of the start of the Nakba — the brutal driving out of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and the ongoing catastrophe of violence, repression and discrimination that has followed it.\nOver five hundred villages were destroyed in that first push to force Palestinians out. But Nakba is a continuing process, not a one-off event. The years since have seen the constant expansion of settlements recognised as illegal by the United Nations, the murder of thousands of civilians — almost a hundred so far this year — and the systematic destruction of the economy and life chances of Palestinians.\nThe right of Palestinians to return to their homes is enshrined in international law and is a fundamental human right, one that any civilised nation should support and demand.\nInstead, because war always involves propaganda, the Palestinians have suffered the added indignity of a campaign of lies to discredit them. Palestine before the occupation is misdescribed as a desert and the very existence of Palestine as an entity in the first place is dismissed. Some supporters of the oppression even claim — in all seriousness — that the Palestinians left voluntarily.\nWhen the media is brave enough to expose what is happening, journalists are often in grave danger as they try to report on real events. This week also marks the first anniversary since the brutal and intentional murder of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. No-one has been brought to justice, and her death with impunity marks a new low under the Israeli government’s extremist regime, which states that they will not bring charges against anyone responsible for her deliberate targeting and death. Al Jazeera has rightly called on the International Criminal Justice Court to intervene.\nThe discrimination goes further than violence and propaganda, with the civil and human rights of Palestinians stripped by a regime that has become even more extremist and bigoted in its latest form and is treating Palestinians not even as second-class citizens but not citizens at all — and not even really human.\nThe correct British response to this oppression and the lies would be sanctions for the oppressors and constant pressure to finally achieve justice for the oppressed.\nInstead, supporters of Palestinian human rights had to go to the Supreme Court last year to fight a government ban on local councils boycotting goods, services and investments linked to Israel’s illegal settlements.\nAnd in March this year, as the 75th anniversary of the Nakba drew closer, the British government rolled out the red carpet for Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu, the perpetrator and propagator of many of the crimes against Palestinians, in a visit designed to strengthen and extend ties between Britain and Israel, in a new “partnership deal.”\nWhen governments will not do the right thing, ordinary people have no choice but to act.\nIn Leicestershire this month, Palestine Action, with significant support from local people and daily co-ordination efforts on direct messaging systems, has begun a “siege” of Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems. The group admits that the aim of the siege is simple but extensive: to drive Elbit out of Britain.\nThe protest has been entirely peaceful, yet police have made indiscriminate arrests, confiscated equipment and even had officers in another jurisdiction arrest the founders of Palestine Action, including British Palestinian woman Huda Ammori.\nSupport amongst Leicester’s local community for the action has been huge, with many from my constituency of Leicester East participating, from assistance in organising to replacing what was lost when police forcibly removed the protesters’ tents, stoves and other equipment. Leicester people clearly understand not just the evils the company represents but the centrality of the right of peaceful protest to a functioning democracy.\nElbit’s presence in Britain is a stark symbol of oppression and the international collusion of governments that enables it to exist.\nThe issue of Elbit in Britain is a human rights and humanitarian issue and our government’s determination to accommodate and protect the company — and award it huge contracts — is a symptom of the growing issues with human rights and respect for international law as Britain moves closer to becoming a rogue authoritarian state.\nThe UN’s human rights organisation has called for a boycott of Elbit and similar firms and earlier this year the UN condemned killings of Palestinian civilians by Israeli Defence Forces in incidents that would certainly have involved Elbit weapons.\nDrones and other weapons manufactured by the company have also been used to attack civilians in Yemen and elsewhere — the company even uses the vast number of hours flown in these places as part of its selling pitch.\nAnd Elbit does more than make hardware. The company provided personnel, as well as weapons, for Israel’s 11-day assault on Gaza in May 2021 that left 248 people dead, including 66 children and hundreds more injured.\nElbit spyware is known to have been used to spy on Ethiopian dissidents here, as well as in the US and elsewhere, while Britain uses its hardware and software over the Channel against refugees fleeing war, persecution and climate disaster.\nThis is a moral and legal issue, but our government consistently sides with the oppressors, whether governments or corporations and is determined to criminalise all kinds of civil protest, pursuing Palestine Action protesters, as well as climate change protesters and others trying to save human lives and protect human rights.\nThe government is even trying to criminalise protest in general, with heavy prison sentences — and it is doing this because these protests are effective.\nPalestine Action’s protests against Elbit have already seen the company close its Oldham facility and offices in London and, reportedly, according to government sources, has lost around £300 million in Ministry of Defence contracts.\nAnd there is a groundswell of solidarity for action against Elbit. Other groups such as Extinction Rebellion have taken or joined actions against the company in support of Palestine Action and the Palestinian people, while in 2021 Leicestershire Fire Brigades Union formerly declared that its members will refuse to help police remove protesters from the Leicester site, telling police commanders that the union stands proudly with the Palestinian people.\nSuch action serves a dual purpose; persistent peaceful protest helps to make Britain a no-go area for those who profit from death and oppression and to embolden ordinary people in other countries to do similarly; but it also raises awareness that builds pressure on Britain’s government to finally take the action that legality and morality demands: to end its support for the Israeli regime and to demand full recognition of and respect for Palestinian lives and human rights. Palestine should be free.\nWhen it’s clear, as now, that governments have no intention of, or even interest in, doing the right thing despite international law and condemnation, ordinary people must act.\nIn the case of Palestine and the Israeli government’s oppression of the Palestinian people, the right thing is to boycott, divest and sanction companies that support and enable the illegal occupation and the murder of civilians.\nThe campaign to end Elbit’s presence in Britain is a central facet of this action. It’s vital that every person of goodwill gives both moral and practical support to those peacefully putting their safety and freedom on the line for the sake of justice.\nIn the absence of Britain government taking immediate action to end all sales of weapons that could be used unlawfully against Palestinian people, I believe direct action in the form of peaceful protest is justified.\nThus, for my part, I stand in complete solidarity with Palestine Action, other peaceful protesters and with the Palestinian people — and against both their oppression by their occupiers and the attempts of Britain government to delegitimise and criminalise those who support their right to be treated as human beings and to return to their homes.\nI urge every reader to do the same, in Leicester and wherever they are needed.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_boohoo-profits-risk-precedent-that-it-pays-to-mistreat-workers/content_569.html": "Boohoo profits ‘risk precedent’ that it pays to mistreat workers’ says Leicester MP Claudia Webbe\nSOARING profits for fast-fashion brand Boohoo set the dangerous precedent that it pays to exploit workers, MP Claudia Webbe has warned.\nThis week the online retailer reported a surge in sales of 41 per cent during lockdown, bringing its profits to £1.7 billion up from £1.2bn a year earlier.\nProfits soared despite the firm facing criticism last year after it emerged that workers in its supply chain were being paid less than the minimum wage and were working in poor conditions. Sub-par safety standards in garment factories in Leicester were linked to the high number cases of Covid-19 in the city, which remained under a local lockdown for months while the rest of the country reopened.\nLeicester East MP Ms Webbe said that Boohoo’s increased revenue is a “sad indictment of our rigged economic system, in which companies that exploit workers are rewarded with ever-increasing revenues.”\n“This sets a dangerous precedent for other businesses — that not only will you not be punished for mass-scale human rights abuses, but that you will get rich quick by doing so,” she said.\n“Boohoo was aware of endemic exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry. Yet they chose to ignore the plight of workers to seek ever-higher profits. Now the exploited labour of Leicester residents is helping to finance extravagant corporate salaries.” The firm told shareholders on Wednesday that its pre-tax profits had been lifted by 35 per cent to £124.7 million. It said this was thanks to the online shopping boom and people’s switch to more casual clothing during lockdown.\nMs Webbe said it is up to the government to hold Boohoo to account.\nThe firm set up an investigation into its supply chain following the scandal. It cut ties with two suppliers and laid out plans to set up its own “model” factory in Leicester.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

There is a large Indian diaspora in the UK, and particularly in my own constituency of Leicester East, who make a unique and incredibly valuable contribution to our community. Leicester has the second highest proportion of Indian residents out of any city in the UK, and Indians make up one of the largest demographics in our city.\nTherefore, like many of my constituents, I am concerned that India is already feeling the impacts of climate change. Heatwaves are becoming more common and severe; heavy rain events have increased threefold since 1950; and rising sea levels are posing new risks as a third of India’s population live along the coast. Low-income and other marginalised groups are most vulnerable to these hazards.\nThe economic costs associated with climate change in India are already immense. In 2020, a single event – Cyclone Amphan – affected 13 million people and caused over $13 billion in damage after it made landfall. One study suggests that declining agricultural productivity and rising cereal prices could increase India’s national poverty rate by 3.5% by 2040 compared to a zero-warming scenario; this equates to around 50 million more Indian people living in poverty.\nClimate breakdown is not a distant threat – but is happening here and now. The World Meteorological Organization found that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. Global grain yields have declined by 10% from heatwaves and floods connected to climate change, unleashing mass hunger and displacement. Over one million people living near coasts have been forced from their homes due to rising seas and stronger storms, and millions more are expected to flee in the coming years.\nHuman-caused climate change has already been proven to increase the risk of floods and extreme rainfall, heatwaves and wildfires with dire implications for humans, animals and the environment.\nWithout immediate government intervention, the urgent action required to preserve a habitable planet will be too slow. This will cause unimaginable disruption and could cost millions of lives, most immediately and sharply in Global South countries which have contributed the least to climate change.\nThe coronavirus crisis has demonstrated that we are only as secure as the most vulnerable among us and that rapid social and economic change really is possible.\nAt this unprecedented moment, governments across the world must consider all possible interventions and regulations to phase out the extraction of fossil fuels and transition to renewables as soon as scientifically possible.\nHydrogen has a crucial role to play and could also provide much needed new jobs as we rebuild from the coronavirus crisis. A report released earlier this month by the Offshore Wind Industry Council and the Offshore Renewable Energy suggested the UK’s green hydrogen industry could generate £320bn for the economy and sustain 120,000 jobs by 2050.\nThere are some who argue that significant amounts of energy are lost in using electricity to produce hydrogen and then in burning hydrogen to produce electricity.\nThus, they argue that the cheapest and therefore most widely used hydrogen is made from “reforming” fossil fuels. This involves using energy to convert fossil fuel into hydrogen and Carbon Dioxide (CO₂). To make the process carbon neutral, that CO₂ must then be removed by carbon capture and storage. However, in my view, it is absurd to allow fossil fuels to be labelled as ‘renewable energy’.\nThe production of ‘green hydrogen’ through electrolysis is currently much more expensive. Governments across the world must therefore focus its investments in making this cleaner form of hydrogen cheaper and more widely accessible.\nOtherwise, we risk the same fossil fuel companies who have profited off the climate crisis to continue to dominate and possibly even hamper our move towards renewables.\nThe Global Hydrogen Council has in a recent study classified India as a net exporter of green hydrogen from 2030, thanks to cheap renewable tariffs. There are vital connections to be made between the UK and India when it comes to developing this cleaner fuel.\nAcross the world, it is particularly vital that we introduce a zero-carbon homes standard for all new homes. As part of heat decarbonisation, we must urgently roll out technologies like heat pumps, solar hot water and green hydrogen, and invest in district heat networks using waste heat.\nDomestic households account for 40% of all-natural gas use in the UK. A fifth of the UK’s carbon emissions come from heating and powering homes, which means that making houses carbon neutral would be a huge contribution to reaching net zero emissions.\nThe Green Industrial Revolution I was elected on would have upgraded almost all of the UK’s 27 million homes to the highest energy-efficiency standards, reducing the average household energy bill by £417 per household per year by 2030 and eliminating fuel poverty.\nThis is especially important in my community, as nearly six thousand households, 14%, in Leicester are in fuel poverty.\nThis speaks to the fact that – in any true green new deal or green industrial revolution – it is vital that the protection of all workers and communities is guaranteed during the transition to renewable energies and a socially-just economy. Because the climate crisis is a class crisis. It must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs, not ordinary people.\nYet sadly, the UK governments’ ‘so called’ green industrial revolution does not go nearly far enough to addressing this existential crisis. Only £4 billion of the £12 billion scheme is newly announced funding, which is four times less than the recently announced £16 billion increase in military spending.\nThe UK government announced a £70 million package to the hydrogen industry in February 2020, but much more support is needed for the sector to develop. In comparison, Germany has pledged €9 billion in support for its hydrogen fuel sector.\nHydrogen is one key aspect of the holistic approach we need to address the climate crisis. Yet the UK government is failing to adequately invest in both hydrogen and a broader climate justice programme.\nThe government must increase their ambition and finally – with action, not rhetoric – start addressing the climate crisis with the urgency it demands. They also must accelerate the transition to green hydrogen and build essential diplomatic connections with India to achieve this global goal. Hydrogen produced exclusively from renewables is the future and India could lead the way.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

You can also add places that are offering help here and sign the petition.\nAll of us together UK are now compiling all these into one place in an easy to search map and website and they need your help! If you’ve found a business, charity or organisation doing this, or you are a representative of one, please enter the information here and they will add it to their #freeschoolmeals map. The data is also available to other websites with free meals info.\nYou can share this form with others too by using this link.\n28th October\nConservatives voted to deny free school meals to 1.4 million working class children; a shameful point in British politics Its a good job we’ve our own hero in Leicester with our Leicester City Mayor Peter Soulsby pledging to feed at least 12,800 children during the holidays.\nIn addition the below are offering services this week in Leicester East in addition to the foodbanks already in place.\nPopat Mithai and Farsan – BELGRAVE\nThis Indian sweets and savouries shop in Belgrave is offering pure vegetarian lunchboxes for children this week.\nLunchboxes can be picked up between October 26 and October 30 from the Popat Chai and Chaat branch at 47, Belgrave Road, LE4 6AR.\nFor more information, call or test 07912 623323.\nThe Dove Pub and Kitchen – EVINGTON\nThe Dove is offering free lunch for kids this week.\nFor those who might be struggling to feed their families during the October break period, despite half-term in Leicester being last week, The Dove is offering a little support.\nFrom Monday, 26 October to Friday 30, October between 12pm and 2.30pm, children’s meals with squash and a piece of fruit will be free.\nFor more information and where to find them, visit the pub’s Facebook page here.\n27th October\nI believe a circuit breaker lockdown would have saved lives in Leicester and people from BAME communities have suffered worst as a result.\nUsing the ONS data it is beyond dispute that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate impact on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Males of black African ethnic background had the highest rate of death, which was 2.7 times higher than males of white ethnic background. Women of a black Caribbean ethnic background also had the highest rate, which is two times higher than females of white ethnic background.\nSage advisory group of scientists and other experts should have been listened to when they recommended a two-week “circuit breaker” lockdown across the country this month. It emerged recently that the experts had suggested a two-week lockdown over the school half-term could have effectively stalled the virus for about four weeks.\nIn May, I asked the Prime Minister how he intended to protect African, Asian and minority ethnic communities from the virus and five months later, his government still refuses to take any actions that would specifically protect our communities.\nThe Government claims to be following the science. Yet just weeks ago, they were urged by SAGE to introduce a two-week circuit breaker lockdown. The Governments’ own group of scientific experts said that the second wave of the virus would ‘fall disproportionately on lower incomes and BAME communities’.\nThe fact that the government ignored this clear scientific advice is a scandal and demonstrates their contempt towards the working class and African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nI urge the government to abandon this head-in-the-sand approach and to push for a zero-Covid strategy to protect everyone in the UK and especially those who the virus has disproportionately affected in order to protect lives of my constituents in Leicester East.\n25th October\nAs the nine nights of Navratri draw to a close we are reminded that in the end our victorywill be one of good over evil.I wish everyone in Leicester East, across Leicester, the UK and globally celebrating thisimportant Hindu festival a happy Dussehra.\n22th October\nThe Chancellor has improved some of the issues that I and colleagues have been lobbying him on for months. Yet, today’s announcement still does not go nearly far enough to protect everyone in Leicester East.\nDespite what our millionaire Chancellor may believe, people in Leicester East and across the country cannot afford to live on two-thirds or two fifths of their pre-pandemic earnings.\nEven after today’s announcement, self-employed people, for instance, will only be able to claim 40% of their pre-crisis profits.\nDuring an unprecedented crisis, the government is handing out poverty payslips and driving our residents into hardship.\nThose on furlough minimum will be expected to continue to work fir less than the minimum wage – there is still a long way to go\nTo protect all communities in Leicester East, they must urgently adopt a zero covid strategy underpinned by an urgent circuit-break lockdown, proper economic support to all and a fully nationalised test and trace system.\n22th October\nBusinesses in Leicester have suffered for too long because of the government’s unclear advice.\nI have written to the Health Secretary urging clearer guidance for hair and beauty salons in our community.\n22nd October\nInternational students are always welcome in Leicester and across the UK.\nThey should not be wrongly accused of cheating. I have written to the government urging them to listen to Migrant Voice‘s campaign\n20th October\nIt was an honour to speak in today’s Parliament Black History Month debate.\nAcross the world, racism and the far right are on the rise. Yet here in Leicester and across the world we have also seen the largest mobilisation of anti-racist protest for decades with the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\nAt this crucial juncture, it has never been more important for us to learn from the history of racial oppression and to end the injustices that exist to this day.\n18th October\nBillionaires exist because of the exploitation of workers. The pursuit of profit knows no shame. Railways stations and railways are stolen public assets – its about time they were returned to public control so that ethical and responsible advertising can be restored.\nBoohoo which owns Pretty Little Thing “tolerates” widespread worker exploitation & abuses of employment law in its UK supply chain, where workers in Leicester’s Garment Industry are paid well below the minimum wage.\nBoohoo is valued at £4bn\n17th October\nWishing everyone in Leicester East, across Leicester, throughout the UK and across theworld a powerful and happy Navratri.Today and everyday but especially over the nine days & nine nights of Navratri festivallets us unite and work together for peace, justice and good health.\n16th October\nIt is estimated that 1.6 million self-employed workers, including thousands in Leicester, have been excluded from government support during this pandemic.\nThe government must step up their support for the self-employed and freelancers, not scale it back as they are proposing to do.\n14th October\nSadly, the government have wasted the sacrifices of people in Leicester and across the country during the Coronavirus pandemic.\nThey have spent billions on a failed test and trace programme which prioritises the enrichment of private corporations over the protection of our communities.\nThe government must introduce a fully public system which empowers local authorities and ensures that people have the means to self-isolate.\n13th October\nIt is crucial that we protect our food and environmental standards as we leave the EU.\nYet the government has refused to enshrine these protections into law, and are simply\nasking people in Leicester and across the country to trust them. Based on the governments track record of privatisation and prioritising corporate profits over public health, I do not believe we can and I will continue to fight for this on behalf of my constituency.\n12th October\nCoronavirus Disease Control\n12th October\nCancel Local Government Debt COVID 19\n12th October\nDWP’s Response to the Coronavirus Outbreak - No Recourse to Public Funds\n12th October\nGarment Industry Must Work with Trade Unions to Set Employee Terms and Conditions\n12th October\nTax Havens Covid 19 Financial Support\n12th October\nRetail Supply Chain Businesses - Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Scheme\n12th October\nReal Living Wage Calculated by the Living Wage Foundation\n12th October\nPlans for Workers Rights After Alison Levitt QC\n12th October\nPeace In Yemen\n12th October\nOverseas Workers who are Victims of Corporate Harm in the UK\n12th October\nMigrant NHS Workers\n12th October\nLocal Government Debt to Fund Essential Services Covid19\n12th October\nJudge-led Public Inquiry into Exploitation in Leicester’s Garment Industry\n12th October\nHospitality Supply Chain - Access to the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund\n12th October\nHigh Executive Pay - Covid19 Financial Support\n12th October\nam supporting Emma Lewell Buck‘s #SchoolBreakfastBill, which will give schools thefunding they need to provide a nutritious free school breakfast to children at risk ofhunger. Latest figures show that 26,000 children in Leicester are growing up in povertyand I will campaign endlessly to support my constituency of Leicester East as no childshould be too hungry to learn.\n8th October\nToday in Parliament there is a Westminster Hall debate on No Recourse to Public Funds.\nThousands of UK residents who are undocumented and those who have No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) have already been driven into destitution during this crisis. Recent Home Office statistics show that the number of migrants with NRPF who have applied for destitution funds increased dramatically, by 572% in the months spanning the coronavirus crisis.\nThe statistics also revealed that it took the Home Office an average of 30 days to decide on these life-or-death applications. In order to speed up the process and enable families to access emergency support, I have written to the Home Secretary to urge the HomeOffice to commit to making these decisions within 24 hours.\nIt is also appalling that the Home Office does not even record the number of UK residents with NRPF. Leicester East is home to many workers with NRPF, for whom it is impossible to survive without attending work – often in unsafe conditions. A significant number of workers inLeicester’s crisis-struck Garment Industry who have approached me for help have the NRPF condition, are unaware of the small number of benefits that they are able to access, and are employed by unscrupulous firms which have no union recognition and where health and safety measures have not been implemented.\nThe government’s justification for this cruel policy is that they are ‘protecting public funds’ by preventing vulnerable migrants from accessing basic benefits. Yet they do note exhibit this same frugality when handing out wasteful, multi-million contracts to private companies, or enabling billionaires and large corporations to evade tax.\nThe government must ensure that all migrants have automatic access to resources without fear of detention or deportation by permanently abolishing the NRPF provision.\n7th October\nIt was a pleasure to join the The All Party Parliamentary Group for British Sikhs –excellently chaired by Preet Kaur Gill MP – for a Zoom virtual lobby yesterday. The theme was on “anti-Sikh hate”, as outlined in Section 4 of the Sikh Manifesto.\nLeicester has the largest Sikh community in the East Midlands and the eighth largestSikh community in England. I am proud of the multiculturalism and diversity of my home city, and the Sikh community contributes very significantly to our collective religious, cultural and political life.\nOver the last few months, I have been working with members of the Sikh community to lobby the government to include a Sikh ethnic tick box in the Census order.\nAt a time when hate crime is rising, it has never been more important for communities to come together and unite. We must oppose any attempt to divide our communities based on nationality or religion.",

Independent MP Claudia Webbe took to her official X handle and stated that farmers’ fight is their fight. Claudia Webbe also condemned the barbwires and tear gas that are used to stop the farmers from going to Delhi. Below is what Claudia Webbe wrote on Farmers Protest 2024-\n“Indian farmers are peacefully protesting. Supported by 200 unions. Potentially largest strike action in the world..They’re met with spiked barricades and tear gas en route to Delhi..Without a guaranteed crop price it condemns millions to exploitation and poverty…Solidarity to Indian Farmers. Your fight is our fight,” wrote Webbe.\nAs soon as Webbe’s tweet viral on social media, a user commented, “Do you have any idea about how many states India has and the number of farmers there are in the country? Even assuming all those protesting are farmers (they aren’t) they don’t represent even 10% of India’s farming population or farm production. Get the facts.” Another user wrote, “If we start to get involved with India’s internal protests we will never get anything done in this country.\nFarmers Protest 2.0\nOver 10,000 farmers are marching to Delhi to protest against the Modi Government over their multiple demands that include a legal guarantee on MSP, India’s exit from WTO, etc. The Delhi Chalo protest was initiated on Tuesday when a meeting between farmer unions and a delegation of the Central Government remained inconclusive. Haryana and New Delhi imposed section 144 to avoid any untoward incidents that occurred during the farmers’ protests in 2020-21.\nTo stop the farmers from marching to Delhi, the Haryana Government used barbed wires, cement barricades, and many more things. Also, heavy security forces and Police officials were deployed in multiple districts to stop the farmers marching to New Delhi. As a result, a scuffle broke out between the farmers and the Police. The Police fired tear gas and pellet guns to disperse thousands of protesters marching to the national capital.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_stand-strong-in-solidarity-for-a-free-palestine/content_493.html": "Stand strong in solidarity for a free Palestine\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe international community needs to exert maximum pressure in the interest of peace in the Middle East and to end Israel’s human rights abuses, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE current crisis in occupied Palestine is gravely concerning.\nAir bombardments and indiscriminate military attacks on the Palestinian people have been ongoing for over a week and show no sign of stopping.\nThe Israeli government has threatened a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reporting that the Israeli Defence Forces have struck over 1,000 targets inside the territory.\nThese sites include high-rise towers, office blocks containing media organisations, including Al-Jazeera and the Associated Press’s Gaza Office, and the largest residential building in Gaza.\nMany will argue it is wrong that rockets from Hamas continue to be fired into Israel, resulting in at least 10 deaths and 150 injured, yet the Israeli response cannot be considered proportionate, just, or fair.\nIn excess of 200 Palestinians have been killed in hundreds of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, including 58 children, with 1,300 people wounded.\nThis massacre has displaced about 38,000 Palestinians from their homes and destroyed electricity, water and hygiene infrastructure.\nEvery life lost is a tragedy and this underlines the need for the international community to act in the interest of peace.\nThousands of Leicester East residents have written to me in anger regarding the Israeli bombing campaign, forced evictions and violence in East Jerusalem, especially the storming of the al-Aqsa mosque, which has led to the deaths and suffering of dozens of Palestinian women and children.\nGiven this strength of feeling, which is replicated in communities across the country, the Westminster government must unequivocally condemn these attacks on the Palestinian people.\nThe continued violation of human rights, including the violence and forced evictions imposed on Palestinians in East Jerusalem, is against international law.\nBombing civilians and targeting places of worship is unacceptable, as are reports that Israeli forces blocked the Red Crescent ambulances reaching the injured and attacked the medical clinic in al-Aqsa mosque.\nThe systemic violence against Palestinians and the illegal Israeli occupation is an international atrocity and was found by a recent Human Rights Watch report to amount to an “apartheid regime.”\nThe short-term set of causes for this latest massive and violent event include internal power struggles within Israel, following a series of inconclusive election results, and the eviction of Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah.\nIn total, 58 people, including 17 children, are due to be forcibly displaced to make way for segregated settlements.\nIn recent weeks we have seen violent settler groups, backed by the Israeli state, intimidating and assaulting Palestinian residents.\nIsraeli police stormed the sacred al-Aqsa mosque ahead of the provocative Jerusalem Day march, which celebrates the 1967 military victory that led to the Israeli occupation and illegal annexation of East Jerusalem.\nThe use of tear gas, grenades and rubber bullets against Palestinian worshippers was appalling, especially during the holy month of Ramadan.\nYet the long-term context, which is systematically under-reported in media accounts of the conflict, lays bare the historical oppression of the Palestinian people.\nThe recent violations are part of an ongoing process of the Nakba that started in 1948 where over 750,000 Palestinians were forced out their homes and made refugees.\nSince occupying the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Israel has unilaterally declared tens of thousands of hectares of “state-land” for Israeli settlements — a process that is illegal under international laws of war and occupation.\nLast year saw the highest rate of settlement expansion in East Jerusalem on record and over 1,500 Palestinians are under threat of their homes being demolished and their being forcibly displaced.\nThe Gaza Strip is effectively an open-air prison, with 95 per cent of the population not having access to clean water, and each Israeli bombing campaign further erodes living standards.\nIsraeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories have been identified by the United Nations as being in breach of international law.\nThe UN secretary-general and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have called on the Israeli government to abandon the illegal annexation plans.\nThe international community must recognise the Palestinian state, stand up for the inalienable human rights of Palestinians and actively support the enforcement of international law.\nBritain is historically and contemporarily complicit in this suffering. As Bernard Regan argues in his book on the Balfour Declaration, the British empire was instrumental in the displacement and subjugation of Palestinian people.\nThe self-determination and protection of the Jewish people after the genocidal horrors of Nazi barbarism following WWII was essential, yet the British empire played a leading role in ensuring that this came at the expense of the Palestinian people.\nIndeed, Patrick Wolfe, the pre-eminent scholar of settler colonialism, classifies the relationship between Israel and Palestine as that of occupier and occupied which is imbued with the logic of elimination.\nUnderstanding this asymmetrical power imbalance is essential in moving towards a future of peace.\nFast forward to today, and the British government has licensed at least £361 million worth of arms sales to Israel since 2014.\nThe Campaign Against Arms Trade reported that previous government reviews have found it likely that British-made arms have been used against Palestinians.\nI have urged the government to end all sales of weapons that could be used unlawfully against Palestinian people.\nAcross the British media landscape, this crisis is routinely reported as a conflict between equals, rather than retaliations to the military actions of a settler-colonial state.\nThis historical context is frequently ignored in favour of a narrative that focuses on Palestinian aggression against Israel.\nThe British press either fails to report on atrocities against the Palestinian people, or else it continues to label these abuses as “clashes” and consistently misrepresents the systemic aggression and violence directed at Palestinians.\nSuch framing serves only to legitimise and obscure the scale of oppression in occupied Palestine.\nThis framing is reflected in the statements of the British government, which neglects to recognise its own complicity in the suffering of the Palestinian people.\nIndeed, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the Hamas rocket attacks yet made no mention of the devastating attacks on Palestinian civilians.\nThe statements from the White House have been equally weak. I have urged the British government to work with the international community and use all diplomatic means available to defuse this crisis, end the violations of international law, argue for a free Palestine and lay the foundations for a future of peace and justice.\nInternational solidarity is vital in this struggle. I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with everyone, in Britain and around the world, who is committed to ending the historical marginalisation of the Palestinian people.\nIn the words of the global movement of solidarity making its voice heard with inspiring mass protests taking place from New York to Istanbul; London to Amman and Berlin to Sydney, “Free, Free Palestine.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

The organisation is inspiring and committed to reforming Pakistan’s primary health care system by providing high-quality healthcare, free at the point of use, for all in need in Pakistan.\nTheir pioneering work in blood transfusion, paediatric oncology services and physical rehabilitation centres are outstanding. Their legacy of service is a testament to the hard work and dedication of their staff. Currently, the Indus hospital and health network serve over 6 million patients annually, providing much-needed healthcare services to those who need it most.\nIndus Health Network aims to build a robust and sustainable healthcare network to benefit future generations. I want to express my deep gratitude to its founder Dr. Abdul Bari Khan, the board of trustees, doctors and staff members who come together to make this organisation prosper. As a team you have promoted love and unity and are securing the future of Pakistan, ensuring everyone receives the healthcare they deserve and need.",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_outrage-over-bus-fare-arrest-of-mum/content_713.html": "Outrage over bus fare arrest of mum\nMother had paid her face, but police brand her ”aggressive”\nA POLICE arrest of a mother for fare evasion sparked widespread uproar today after a video of the incident was circulated on social media.\nThe mother, who was handcuffed in Croydon, south London, last Friday (21 July) had paid her bus fare and was innocent of the crime she was being accused of.\nA statement from the Metropolitan Police branded the woman as “aggressive” and downplayed the video, suggesting it did not show the full picture.\nThe video was met with outrage, while the police statement was heavily criticised.\nAuthor Nels Abbey wrote: “A woman is placed in handcuffs and manhandled by two police officers, a needless fiasco which left her infant son severely distressed… all over a lousy £1.75 bus fare. And it looks like she was entirely innocent.”\nClaudia Webbe MP responded: “Outrageous. The most disrespected person is the Black woman. The most unprotected person is the Black woman. The most neglected person is the Black woman The Met Police is the boot of the state; they do not care about Black people and Black women in particular.”\nSocial commentator Kelechi Okafor added: “Not just the mayor of London but leaders of the opposition who keep waltzing with the idea of giving police more powers. The BLACK MOTHER and her very young BLACK SON were being dehumanised by the Met police.”\nThe incident comes in the same week that the Metropolitan Police published the London Met Plan – a response to the Casey Report which accused the force of being institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic.\nThe Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley dug his heels in over his rejection of the term ‘institutionally racist’, but said he was committed to rooting out “systemic issues.”\nA statement from the Metropolitan Police about the incident read: “We are aware of a video circulating showing a female being handcuffed by police.\n“Officers from the Roads and Transport Policing Command were conducting a joint revenue protection operation with Transport for London inspectors in Whitehorse Road, Croydon, on Friday, 21 July.\n“One woman left the bus after not complying with a revenue inspector’s request to check that she had paid her fare. When asked to stop by police she attempted to walk off and became abusive. As a result she was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and detained.\n“When it was later established that the woman had paid she was de-arrested and allowed to go on her way.\n“The woman was with her child and we appreciate that the video and circumstances look concerning. However, it is a snapshot of a wider incident. The video from this incident and the officers body worn video, which was active for a longer period than the social media clip, has been reviewed.\n“Our officers regularly liaise with local community groups and forums and we will be discussing the matter with them and listening to their views.”\nFlorence Eshalomi MP has been in touch with police and raised the matter with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. It is understood there will be a meeting tomorrow about it.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

What the f*** is going on?”\nPolice said they arrested the woman in Croydon, south London, on Friday, 21 July, after she failed to confirm with a Transport for London (TfL) ticket inspector that she had paid her bus fare.\nIn a statement, the Met Police said the video was only a “snapshot” of the incident, and that the woman had become “abusive” before being arrested for fare evasion.\nIt later emerged that she had paid and was de-arrested and released back to her child.\nAssistant Commissioner Matt Twist said that officers from the Met’s Roads and Transport Policing Command were supporting TfL ticket inspectors on a pre-planned operation in Windmill Road.\nHe said: “Anyone without a valid ticket is required to provide their details to a TfL inspector so a penalty fare can be issued. This is not a policing matter. Officers only become involved where details are not provided or where someone tries to leave when challenged.\n“The woman involved in this incident was asked to provide her ticket as she got off the bus, but did not do so. She was spoken to by a TfL inspector, then by a PCSO and finally by a police officer. She continued to try to walk away and did not provide her ticket for inspection.”\nHe added that the child was comforted by a PCSO and that the force “regret” any impact the incident may have had upon him.\nThe police watchdog have now been called to review footage of the incident and the circumstances around it.\nLabour MP for Vauxhall Florence Eshalomi tweeted: “There is a distressing video circulating online with a woman handcuffed in front of her young son.\n“Please be careful sharing this online to help protect this young boy who is very traumatised by the situation. Myself and other colleges have raised this with the Mayor of London.”\nFellow MP Claudia Webbe said: “The most disrespected person is the Black woman. The most unprotected person is the Black woman. The most neglected person is the Black woman.\n“The Met Police is the boot of the state; they do not care about Black people, and Black women in particular.”\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: “The footage circulating online is troubling to watch and the Mayor is clear that it is right that this matter has been referred to the IOPC so that the full circumstances can be independently reviewed.”\nWith the IOPC due to investigate, Detective Chief Superintendent Christina Jessah said on Monday: “We know that this is a distressing video to watch, even more so as a child is seen to be visibly upset by the way in which his mother has been apprehended. We regret the upset that has been caused to the child.\n“A PCSO (police community support officer) can be seen comforting the child; however, we know that this does not take away from the impact that this will have on him.\n“We are seeking to make contact with the female in question to understand the wider circumstances.\n“Given the level of public concern we will ask the Independent Office for Police Conduct to review the circumstances shown in the video clip.\n“We are currently working with the local senior police teams and Transport for London.”\nIn a statement, the Met Police said: “We are aware of a video circulating showing a female being handcuffed by police. Officers from the Roads and Transport Policing Command were conducting a joint revenue protection operation with Transport for London inspectors in Whitehorse Road, Croydon, on Friday, 21 July.\n“One woman left the bus after not complying with a revenue inspector’s request to check that she had paid her fare. When asked to stop by police she attempted to walk off and became abusive. As a result, she was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and detained.\n“When it was later established that the woman had paid she was de-arrested and allowed to go on her way.\n“The woman was with her child and we appreciate that the video and circumstances look concerning. However, it is a snapshot of a wider incident. The video from this incident and the officer’s body-worn video, which was active for a longer period than the social media clip, have been reviewed.\n“Our officers regularly liaise with local community groups and forums and we will be discussing the matter with them and listening to their views.”\nThe IOPC said a complaint had been made accusing police of racially profiling the woman, who is Black.\nA spokesperson said: “We have received a complaint referral from the Metropolitan Police Service following an incident in Whitehorse Road, Croydon on 21 July where a woman was handcuffed.\n“The complaint alleges the woman was racially profiled and verbally abused by an officer.\n“We will now assess the referral and decide if any further action is required from us.”",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_justice-still-denied-for-1984-sikh-massacre/content_207.html": "Justice still denied for 1984 Sikh massacre\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nPain and anger run through a community 40 years on as British Sikhs march demanding a full reckoning with Britain’s collusion in events in India that led to a genocide that butchered thousands, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nFORTY years ago this month, Indian government troops stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism’s holiest shrine. In recognition of the anniversary, thousands of British Sikhs from across Britain marched last weekend in central London.\nThe Amritsar assault caused the death of around 300-500 Sikhs, an atrocity that was followed, a few months later, by the massacre of as many as 17,000 innocent Sikhs by organised mobs and the displacement of tens of thousands more. The aim was to stop those who campaign for an independent homeland, called Khalistan.\nLeaked papers showed that the US government believed the Indian government was complicit in the genocide, yet Western governments took no action, and in four decades only one person has been convicted for their role in the slaughter, 34 years after the crime.\nPapers released by the British government in 2014, under the 30-year rule, revealed that the British military sent an adviser to Amritsar to help the Indian troops organise and carry out the Golden Temple assault — and that then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher was well aware of the British army’s role in the mass killing.\nIn the decade since Britain has made no formal investigation of the role of the Thatcher government in the atrocity or the Indian government’s involvement in the subsequent mass murder.\nThat complicity may include many senior Indian figures and the role of institutional anti-Sikh racism at the highest levels, as the powerful sought to stamp out the Sikh independence movement and to maintain its grip on Punjab.\nThe involvement of the regime in the violence was not limited to tacit support or organisational assistance. In a 2004 first-edition report by human rights group ENSAAF, titled Twenty Years of Impunity, survivors and eyewitnesses spoke of watching police and even government officials participating in the violence, murder, sexual violence and mutilations they saw.\nENSAAF went on to conclude that its report “reveals the systematic and organised manner in which state institutions, such as the Delhi Police, and Congress (I) officials perpetrated mass murder in November 1984 and later justified the violence in inquiry proceedings.”\nThe revelation of the British government’s involvement in the Golden Temple massacre also led to accusations against later British governments of a cover-up. David Cameron, prime minister at the time of the initial disclosure that SAS advisers were sent to assist Indian troops, ordered an inquiry. The inquiry claimed to have examined 23,000 documents before reporting just three weeks later that the British military involvement did not have a significant impact.\nBut a Freedom of Information Act request by Declassified UK — despite legal attempts by the government to avoid providing the information — revealed that the Cameron inquiry involved “one or more” people who were working in Britain-India relations at the time of Operation Blue Star, the storming of the temple.\nOne of those was also, most likely to be involved, as a “sensitivity reviewer” responsible for ensuring documents were not released that might embarrass the British government. The information obtained by Declassified UK indicated that on the day before the Golden Temple massacre in 1984, one of those most likely to be involved had written: “It would be dangerous if HMG [the British government] were to become identified, in the minds of Sikhs in Britain, with some more determined action by the Indian government, in particular any attempt to storm the Golden Temple at Amritsar.”\nThe continuing lack of clarity around the killings, let alone any sign of accountability for officials involved in India or Britain, is arguably, a matter of deep concern to British Sikhs — it is not merely one of historical relevance.\nAs we see so often, attempts to violently suppress the desire for freedom only strengthens it. The movement for an independent Punjabi Sikh state, which had been growing for decades, has grown stronger still from the 1980s to now — and the Indian government continues to be accused of trying to suppress it.\nHuman Rights Watch has said that Indian forces and police routinely use human rights violations as a weapon against Sikhs and that the 21st century has seen thousands murdered in staged shootouts and buried without identification and with no criminal investigation.\nAnd only in the last year, we have seen the Indian government accused, by the Canadian government and others, of involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada, the foiled attempt to procure a murder contract on Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US and the sudden death of Avtar Singh Kanda in Britain after a series of threats by Indian police.\nCanada also said it had uncovered a list of more than 20 Sikhs worldwide that it believed was a hit list of activists targeted for assassination.\nAdditionally, the question of British government collusion in a massacre in Punjab raised again the issue of complicity in the genocide being inflicted on the people of Palestine in Gaza and the violent suppression of Palestinians in the West Bank.\nLike the Sikhs in 1984 and since, the people of Gaza are facing a regime determined to hold onto territorial control or even to eradicate or displace an entire population.\nLike the Sikhs, they are suffering mass murder at the hands of a government with contempt for human rights and international law while too many Western governments sit on their hands and look the other way.\nTens of thousands of innocent Palestinians have already been murdered and maimed, and more are added every day, while their homes, schools and hospitals have been destroyed.\nSolidarity with oppressed Palestinians is strong among the Sikh community in Leicester East. They know what Palestinians are suffering because they have suffered in a similar way.\nForty years is too long to wait for justice for crimes against humanity. Any further attempts to cover up or obscure who colluded in mass murder or to delay an inquiry are unacceptable.\nCivil society in solidarity must take the opportunity to demand of Parliament and the new British government, following the general election of July 4, to immediately order a full independent, fully resourced investigation or judge-led inquiry into the involvement of the British government, with a transparent and clear timescale to complete the work. As many British Sikhs have said, the truth should no longer be hidden.\nTransparency over, what is arguably now known as the Sikh genocide and the ongoing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza is essential, if the people of Britain are to have any faith in, or respect for our democratic processes and our country’s commitment to human rights.\nThe Sikh community and the people of Palestine must have justice, freedom and peace.\nClaudia Webbe is the independent parliamentary candidate for Leicester East.\nYou can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",
  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-year-round-nhs-winter-crisis-is-intentional/content_575.html": "This year-round NHS winter crisis is intentional\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe only solution that will genuinely fix the NHS is to restore it to a single, national service free to all and in genuine public ownership, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nAs usual at this time of year, the headlines are full of the so-called “winter crisis” in the NHS, with talk of “pressures” and “demand” recited almost unchallenged as the cause of the disaster.\nBut it is vital to be clear that the NHS is not merely collapsing, it is in a state of induced collapse. When the Conservative government came into power in 2010, a healthy NHS quickly went into such decline that what were at first regular “winter crises” became year-round crisis and then collapse.\nPublic satisfaction with our health service went into freefall, from a record high of over 70 per cent in 2010 to the current day reality of 36 per cent between 2020 and 2021 and arguably even far less now.\nSeven million people are waiting for NHS treatment, over 400,000 patients have been waiting longer than a year. What was once one of the most highly regarded and most efficient health services in the world is now a shadow of its former self.\nThis has not happened by accident. The NHS has been fragmented by government policy, services and hospitals have been closed by policy and much of what remains has been privatised, while wages have been cut in real terms for years, leaving more than 130,000 unfilled vacancies and staff unable to cope with the inhuman demands put on them.\nAll this has been done intentionally, to cause collapse as an excuse for more and more privatisation — and all in the full knowledge of what the consequences would be, for those who need the NHS and for those who work in it and the deaths that it would cause.\nAccording to the President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, 500 people a week are dying needlessly waiting for emergency care.\nThe Conservatives’ priorities are wrong, their ideological pursuit of privatisation to enrich their donors is driving the NHS to despair.\nNow their next phase is under way, with further closures of services to concentrate what remains of the NHS into regional centres, leaving many people far from the care they need. Rationing and the so-called “postcode lottery” are now common.\nIn an illustration of the perversity of the system the government created — though hardly ever mentioned by the “mainstream” media — providers are financially incentivised to cut costs, and withhold treatment, through so called integrated care systems (ICS).\nThese integated care systems, which even the King’s Fund acknowledges, are based on a US “accountable care” system that is designed to withhold treatment and slim down healthcare in order to cut costs and share the profits with private providers\nHow does this work? A group of providers are allowed to keep some of what they manage to avoid spending from a pooled healthcare budget. In conjunction with national shrinkage targets, the result has been fewer services, fewer beds and fewer hospital accident and emergency units.\nSince 2021, Tim Ferris, of the Massachusetts General Physicians Organisation, has been NHS England’s “national director of transformation” applying this scheme.\nBut before that, he’d been invited to Britain to explain how the system works. He said: “If we can keep our spending below [set costs] then we will share in some of the savings, and that’s the basis for the accountable care organisation contracts.”\nNHS England’s strategy unit has made clear that cash for cuts is central to the purpose of integrated care systems: “Risk and reward-sharing is a key feature of the policy agenda for accountable care organisations in the US and integrated care systems in England.\n“It is a simple and attractive concept, offering a commissioner the opportunity to co-opt and incentivise a provider to moderate growth in healthcare demand by sharing in the savings or cost over-runs.”\nInstead, in Parliament MPs were told this was about “integrating” services, allowing the government to avoid a proper debate on the real policy, that of closing and downgrade services.\nIn his Oscar-nominated film Sicko, which examined the perverseness of the US healthcare system, Michael Moore warned us how rewarding such reductions in state care had ballooned the US healthcare industry: “Patients were given less and less care […] while health insurance companies became wealthy.”\nFar from being just an absence of resources, this US-mimicking policy direction, with nationally mandated reductions in services, is designed to bar and discourage patients from accessing services, running the NHS like a business on minimal capacity, instead of like a public service. This is the real core of where our NHS is today.\nTrusts that don’t reach government cost-cutting targets are punished still further with reductions in finance, with obvious adverse consequences for patients and staff.\nMy constituency of Leicester East has been hit, as hard as any, by the huge health inequalities that this has created, while simultaneously every hospital in the area has opened foodbanks for its workers.\nNone of this is just “happening” — the government and media use Covid as an excuse but the collapse goes back much further than the start of the pandemic.\nWe’re rarely reminded of it now, but the years leading up to Covid were marked by year-round “winter crisis” levels of collapse that seemed to reach record proportions annually — and the Tories cut a staggering 2.7 million “bed days” from NHS capacity during the pandemic, leaving an already decimated NHS with barely half the number of beds per thousand people as compared to other Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) EU countries.\nThe average number of beds per 1,000 people in OECD EU nations was 4.6, but the UK had just 2.4. The British government has simply not put the money in to achieve parity.\nThe government makes noises about occasional, inadequate additional funding, but as long as services remain fragmented and privatised that just means more money goes into private profits and pointlessly duplicated management. Talk of more privatisation as a solution is simply an excuse to accelerate the demise of our national treasure.\nThe only solution that will genuinely fix the NHS is to restore it to what it once was and always should be: a single, national service free to all and in genuine public ownership.\nIt’s self-evident when looked at logically — private companies will always be looking at their profit margins and for every pound that goes to private providers only a portion will be used to provide care while the rest is taken as profit.\nIn a publicly owned NHS, where the profit motive is rightly excluded, every penny that goes in is spent on care and if there is any surplus it is reinvested straight back into more and better care.\nAs socialists we have to be resolute and committed not only to bringing the NHS back into public ownership, but to create a national care service to go alongside it and provide care for those who need it, when they need it, for free.\nNot only would this immediately alleviate a huge amount of pressure on the NHS — because the care system would not be collapsing as it is now — but only those who needed an NHS bed would be in one.\nAny politician claiming to have a fix for the “problems” of the NHS that does not include renationalisation at the very least is failing both NHS staff and patients and adding to the misinformation that has been inflicted on the public for far too long.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

She noted that due to Israel allowing a fraction of the aid needed for Gaza residents and the destruction of a majority of UN trucks, deaths from hunger and disease would worsen.\nPointing out that more than 150 UN personnel were killed in Israel’s attacks, Webbe noted that the Israeli government held the UN responsible for the situation and used humanitarian aid as a weapon of war. She also noted that Israeli ministers suggested using nuclear bombs on Gaza.\n“I will not be an accomplice,” Webbe mentioned receiving more than 6,000 letters and emails from constituents urgently calling for a cease-fire.\nShe said she consoled individuals who had lost families under the rubble and were anxiously concerned about their loved ones and friends in Gaza, asserting that she would not remain silent.\n“Collective punishment is a war crime, forcible transfer of the population is a war crime, indiscriminate bombing and the use of white phosphorus on civilians – now confirmed by Amnesty International – is a war crime. I will not be an accomplice,” she said.\nWebbe stated she signed the official complaint submitted to the ICC because those responsible must be held accountable and she invited her colleagues to act in a similar fashion.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_british-imperialisms-shameful-role-in-gaza-and-yemen/content_163.html": "British imperialism’s shameful role in Gaza and Yemen\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nBritain has gone from supplying the weapons and training to others to dropping the bombs itself — yet it is Yemen that is in fact acting to prevent further bloodshed, in line with international law explains CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE current bombing of Yemen is anything but new — the bombing of Yemen, colonised by Britain until 1967, has occurred in at least 15 of the last 100 years.\nThis number does not include the period from 2014, when the ground crews of Britain’s RAF were embedded with the Saudi air force, as it bombed hospitals, funerals and food stores as part of the Saudi-led, US-backed, war on Yemen, compounding the violence and famine inflicted on innocent civilians.\nAccording to the UN, the direct violence of bombs — many of them made and supplied by Britain — and bullets killed more than 150,000 people, while almost a quarter of a million were killed by hunger and disease, 11,000 or more of them children.\nDuring this period, since 2014, according to Action on Armed Violence, Britain has licensed around £7.5 billion of arms sales and weapons to Saudi Arabia, a marked acceleration.\nThere was a lull in the bombing in 2022, after the Houthis struck Saudi oil facilities, prompting a renewal of negotiations. Then, only last month, UN envoy Hans Grundberg announced agreement among the parties on a ceasefire and a commitment to a UN-led peace process — at last, a chance of real respite for the suffering millions of Yemen.\nYet now, tragically, Yemen is being bombed again — and this time, Britain is doing much more than support and enablement, participating with the US in repeated bombing raids on Houthi facilities that have shattered hopes of peace and inflamed the danger of conflict consuming the whole Middle East region.\nAnd it is doing this because the Houthis have taken action, as they argue, they are obliged to do under international law, to try to pressure Israel into ending its killing of civilians in Gaza, by intercepting shipping bound for or owned by Israel.\nBritain claims its actions in bombing Yemen are to protect trade and have nothing to do with Israel, a claim that Campaign Against the Arms Trade has described as “farcical.”\nGiven their own history, the Yemenis know what the people of Gaza are going through. They know what it’s like to face constant, merciless bombardment and they know what it’s like to suffer hunger and disease from blockades and the intentional destruction of food supplies and hospitals. They know what it’s like to face the worst humanitarian disaster.\nWhile Britain, the US and other Western powers sat on their hands — or worse, provided political cover, logistical support, money and weapons to Israel — arguably, Yemen, took its legal and moral obligations, to intervene to prevent genocide, seriously.\nAnd so, our government and that of the US are bombing them again, valuing commerce and convenience above the lives of innocent civilians.\nBut as so often happens, when imperial powers barge and blunder in, they make things worse, not better. According to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), the bombings have stoked outrage in neighbouring nations and have fuelled the threat of a widened conflict, while doing nothing to protect shipping and trade.\nShipping companies are still shunning the area as danger and insurance costs soar — and now the Houthis have fired at least one missile at a US naval vessel and with another have hit at least one commercial vessel, believing that British and US warships are legitimate targets after the bombing attacks in Yemen.\nThe precipitate nature of Britain’s action was further exposed last Friday when the International Court of Justice (ICJ) announced its findings in relation to South Africa’s genocide case against Israel.\nThe International Court for Justice noted the scale of Israel’s slaughter in Gaza, including the destruction of homes and the forced transfer of the population — in itself a war crime — and noted, too, statements made by among others, Israel’s president and defence minister, making the case of genocide plausible.\nIt also found that these acts, along with Israel’s blockade of food, water, fuel and medical supplies merited a full genocide trial — and ordered Israel to not only stop killing Palestinians in Gaza, but to stop anyone else killing them, too.\nAs Amnesty International noted after the court’s announcement, these findings and orders oblige every signatory to the Genocide Convention to take every available measure to intervene to prevent genocidal acts, including Britain, the US — and Yemen.\nAccording to Euro-Med Monitor, in the two days after the ICJ’s order to Israel to prevent the killing of Palestinians, at least 373 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombings and air strikes — including 345 civilians — and wounded 643 others. Yet Britain and the US continue to ignore their obligations and provide cover and assistance, and are bombing Yemen, in direct violation of international law.\nNot only that, but they have also launched a financial assault on the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides desperately needed humanitarian relief to over two million people of Gaza who are facing constant bombing and a ground invasion alongside the famine and disease that Israel’s continuing blockade and destruction of hospitals and homes have imposed.\nAfter Israel alleged that a handful of UNRWA’s 13,000 Gazan employees participated in the October 7 raid, Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden immediately ended British and US funding for UNRWA. The US is, or was, UNRWA’s biggest single funder, but Israel has long attacked the UN organisation for keeping Palestinian refugees’ hopes alive of returning to the homes from which they were forced out.\nThe withdrawal of US and British funds will be a heavy blow to UNRWA’s ability to help desperate Palestinians in Gaza and is regarded by many analysts as a co-ordinated attempt to accelerate the attrition of famine and disease in defiance of the ICJ’s rulings.\nBritain’s history of actions in and against Yemen has been a shameful one, surpassed only perhaps by its betrayal of the Palestinians from Balfour onwards and now in Sunak’s contemptuous dismissal of the ICJ’s findings and his refusal to make even a gesture toward implementing its binding orders.\nNow Britain is weaving both those shameful histories together, written in bombs, bullets and betrayal, attacking Yemen for its attempts to help the people of Gaza, attacking the people of Gaza by defunding UNRWA and providing materials, logistical support and political cover for Israel’s ongoing mass slaughter.\nThat long and shameful record needs to change, starting now. It’s very clear that the British government, whether the current Sunak regime or a future Labour government under Keir Starmer, will not change course unless they are forced to by relentless political pressure and increased public protest and awareness.\nThat will require an ongoing international campaign and movement and continued protests against Israel’s “genocidal acts” in Gaza and challenging the complicity of Western governments, including Britain that allows Israel to act with impunity.\nAlso, to embrace calls for Britain to stop attacking Yemen, obey its own unequivocal obligations under international law and take its own actions, in line with the ICJ ruling to protect the people of Palestine.\nOur international voices in solidarity will need to be louder. We owe it to the tens of thousands of mostly women and children killed in Gaza and the almost two million Palestinians driven to the brink of starvation. Our rally call must be clear stop bombing Yemen; stop bombing Gaza.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_a-declaration-of-war-on-our-right-to-protest/content_893.html": "A declaration of war on our right to protest\nBy Claudia Webbe\nThe Policing Bill represents another step towards authoritarianism — it must be scrapped, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE\nLAST week every single Conservative MP voted in favour of a piece of legislation that would not look out of place within the world’s most authoritarian regimes.\nSignificant concerns have been raised by human-rights groups, lawyers and activists that the Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill constitutes a significant reduction in established freedom to protest. The Bill includes measures to “strengthen police powers to tackle non-violent protests that have a significant disruptive effect on the public or on access to Parliament.”\nThe Metropolitan Police’s awful mismanagement of Saturday’s peaceful vigil in memory of Sarah Everard should remind the government that the police do not need any more powers to suppress our democratic rights of free assembly and peaceful protest. If anything, now is the time for the rights of protesters to be broadened and strengthened.\nGiven recent events, now is also the time to unite the country and put in place long-overdue protections for women against unacceptable violence, including action against domestic homicides, rape and street harassment — as well as tackling the misogynistic attitudes that underpin the abuse women face.\nYet instead of doing this, the government is rushing through a bill that will grant the police even greater power to prevent peaceful protests. The fact that this comes just days after the appalling brutal policing of the peaceful vigil in memory of a woman allegedly murdered by a serving police officer indicates a worrying disregard of civil liberties and women’s rights by this government.\nWhile the Bill has not yet passed into law, we are already seeing an outpouring of popular opposition to this curtailment of civil liberties. There were peaceful protests outside Parliament for much of last week and on Sunday, a peaceful Kill the Bill protest in Bristol spilled into violence.\nMany have condemned the violence seen on the streets of Bristol — yet the government cannot restrict freedoms and remove the right to protest and not expect fallouts. Just as police attempts to silence grieving women in Clapham backfired, the scenes in Bristol demonstrate that the creeping authoritarianism of the state has repercussions.\nAs US president John F Kennedy once said: “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.” The government must listen to the widespread popular opposition to this dangerous legislation by scrapping the Bill.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has previously criticised protests and direct action, especially those by Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter. After XR activists blockaded printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp in September 2020, the Home Secretary described them as “so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals.” She also described the Black Lives Matter protests in Britain in the summer of 2020 as “dreadful.”\nAs police monitoring group Netpol commented, the “Home Secretary’s plans look, on the face of it, like a combination of defending business interests and petty vengeance against political and social movements she dislikes.”\nWhile criticising the Black Lives Matter protests, Priti Patel also said that “I don’t support protest.” Though she corrected her meaning to be a specific protest, not protests in general, after being prompted by the interviewer, this could have well been a Freudian slip, because the legislation her government is pushing through is defined by a contempt for the democratic right of peaceful protest.\nI was proud to stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter protests and I will continue to support all those across the world who are safely and peacefully protesting against systems of racist oppression. Organised peaceful resistance is a force for change and is deserving of our full support. Much of the historic gains we have made, from women’s rights to racial equality and improved working conditions, were not handed down from above but fought for by generations of mass struggle.\nBy making it illegal to hold a protest that “threatens annoyance,” this legislation is a declaration of war upon this democratic right. Anyone who has been to a demonstration knows that “annoying” those with power is rather the point of a protest. Even Theresa May, whose authoritarian reign as home secretary led to the creation of the “hostile environment,” spoke against the dangerous scope of powers that this legislation would enable police to wield against protesters.\nThere are grave concerns that this legislation will have a disproportionate effect on African, Asian and minority-ethnic communities. Rights group Liberty anticipates the impact of the Bill to be “felt particularly acutely by marginalised communities.”\nLiberty has also expressed concerns about the proposal to establish a stop & search power specifically targeted at protesters, because “existing stop & search powers are used against communities of colour and black men in particular, at staggeringly disproportionate rates.”\nAccording to Roma-rights group Friends of Romano Lav, the legislation will also have a devastating effect on Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities.\nThe Bill also introduces longer prison sentences that are explicitly aimed to stoke divisive culture wars. The fact that this legislation could introduce longer sentences for damaging a statue than assaulting a woman reveals how utterly unserious this government is about tackling gendered violence.\nThe criminal justice system should not be reduced to political point-scoring, yet this this government is shamelessly using arbitrary and disproportionate prison sentences to fan the flames of division.\nIt is not hyperbolic to state that this Bill represents yet another step towards authoritarianism by this government. It is important to remember that it follows the government’s spy cops legislation, which legalised violence, murder, rape and sexual assault perpetrated by undercover officers.\nThis is clearly not a government that prioritises the wellbeing of women. Considering just 21 per cent of the current Cabinet are women — the lowest proportion for decades — this sadly should not come as a surprise.\nThe tragic murder of Everard, followed by the unforgivable police crackdown of a peaceful vigil in her memory, has rightly instigated a national demand for action to tackle violence against women.\nViolence against women is an epidemic. Every year across the world, 66,000 women are killed by a man. In terms of domestic violence, a partner is responsible in almost 40 per cent of homicides involving a female victim compared with 6 per cent partner responsibility for homicides involving a male victim.\nIn Britain the conviction rate for domestic violence is 6.2 per cent, an appallingly low figure. Particularly shocking given the events of the last week is that police officers and staff accused of domestic abuse are a third less likely to be convicted than the public, with a conviction rate of just 3.9 per cent.\nThis violence has a trickle-down effect on the safety and wellbeing of women, who are forced to endure the constant threat of potential male violence. From parks and bus stops to our local high streets, girls and young women across Britain are facing appalling misogynistic harassment every day.\nThe spectre of violence blights the lives of girls and women, affecting their mental health, self-esteem and sense of safety and impinging on their right to equal access to public space. A recent survey by UN Women UK found that 97 per cent of 18- to 24-year-old women had been sexually harassed, while 80 per cent of women of all ages had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces.\nThis reveals how much work we must do to end the scourge of gendered violence and to build a future free of misogyny, racism and the oppression of civil liberties. What is clear is that the Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill has no part to play in this future. It must be scrapped.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

A memorial was held on Kent Street, where Antoin was killed, on Saturday September 9, on the 10th anniversary of his death.\nSpeeches were delivered by Antoin’s mother Cheryl Armatrading as well as the Lord Mayor Dr Susan Barton. A minute’s silence was also held by Antoin’s friends and family while candles were lit around a plaque in his memory, before balloons were released into the sky.\nA service was also held at Nirvana FC in Hamilton for Antoin’s loved ones. Football had been a huge part of Antoin’s life.\nAntoin was a community champion, a football coach to children and the founder Strive 4 Success which was later changed to Antoin Akpom Achievements Foundation after his death. The foundation hosts crime prevention workshops and provides opportunities for young people in the community.\nCheryl is now continuing her son’s legacy, through the foundation, and she recently set up the AA Foundation football team in Beaumont Leys in her son’s memory. She said: “It was very emotional for me as a mother, but it just goes to show the love that people had for Antoin.”\n“The charity that we started in his memory is bringing people together and creating a platform for young people to have opportunities. His thing was about challenging behaviour and changing lives and that’s what we are doing.\n“The charity has different intervention projects and workshops. He must be smiling seeing that everything that he wanted is becoming a reality.”\nIn her speech delivered at the memorial, the Lord Mayor said: “Antoin was just starting in life. He was engaged and has a baby boy. He wanted to make a real difference to young people’s lives through sport and he started his own business.\n“We all know that Leicester is well known for its diversity and as the Lord Mayor I am proud of the community cohesion that we share across the city and its vital that we continue to strengthen this cohesion by working together and respecting each others cultures and values and doing what we can to eliminate persecution, hate crime and violence. I congratulate Cheryl for her dedication and positivity to keeping her son’s memory alive.”\nShe added: “We share in the pain and the violence that has taken place here and it’s obviously something we have to come together to eliminate from our communities.”\nLeicester East MP Claudia Webbe was also among those to attend Antoin’s memorial. She said: “I think it’s really important that we are all here recognising and remembering the legacy of Antoin.\n“I’d like to see the government declare knife crime as an epidemic, because if we do so, the right resources and investment can be put back into our communities, not just here in Leicester but everywhere. It’s horrifying for any family to go through a loss of this nature but to have to experience it with a young person is tremendously harmful.”\n“The justice needed is a justice that ends knife crime for good.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_mp-in-calls-for-fashion-watchdog-after-expose/content_272.html": "MP in calls for fashion watchdog after expose\nA CITY MP is calling for a “fashion watchdog” following a Panorama expose alleged online brand Boohoo failed to stick to promises to overhaul its processes to ensure garment workers were being treated fairly.\nClaudia Webbe, independent MP for Leicester East, has demanded a new statutory regime, including penalties and criminal sanctions to force brands and retailers to behave ethically and sustainably – after the BBC documentary revealed ongoing sharp practice and exploitation at Boohoo, one of the UK’s biggest online fast fashion clothing retailers.\nIt purported to show Boohoo engaged in price cutting among its suppliers in a race to the bottom and the practice of amending prices and discounting further after the stock had already been made.\nIt also alleged a breach of the reforms Boohoo promised through its Agenda for Change, after its agreement to implement recommendations arising from the Alison Levitt KC’s investigation into unethical and dangerous practices in its supply chain\nThe company was shown imposing cuts to agreed prices when its suppliers were just about to deliver and penalising its supply chain of factories for failing to meet arbitrary and unachievable deadlines, with consequences for garment workers.\nBoohoo last year made a reported £1.7 billion worth of sales.\nClaudia said: “The new BBC Panorama revelations about Boohoo are appalling but not surprising. Exploiand unethical practice are built into the global garment industry, and it is always the workers, usually women from racialised groups, who suffer most. The company’s silence and abandonment of the promises it made in 2020 when its unethical supply chain was exposed is deeply concerning.\n“In Leicester’s garment industry, workers, overwhelmingly women, suffer poverty pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions fuelled by the greed of brands, who cut prices unilaterally to fatten profits at the expense of those least able to afford it. Suppliers and garment factories rather than being left out of pocket are passing the price cuts on to workers with further reduced pay, loss of work and rights.\n“This race to the bottom leads to suppliers and manufacturers underpaying their workers and demandtation ing uncontracted and unpaid overtime, as well as shortcuts on safety and working conditions.”\nA BBC reporter who spent 10 weeks working undercover at Boohoo’s head office, in Manchester, alleged she had learned just 1 per cent of Boohoo orders were being made at the company’s new Leicester factory – which Boohoo had said would be a “centre of excellence”.\nClaudia said: “The documentary appears to show Boohoo’s ‘flagship’ production facility in Leicester East on Thurmaston Lane is little more than a front for more cheap imports from countries where workers are even easier to abuse and exploit. Garment workers tell me all they do is falsely change the label to ‘made in Britain.’\n“Boohoo’s repeated disregard of its ethical pledge shows brands and retailers cannot be trusted to police themselves. New legislation is needed urgently to force companies to behave ethically, sustainably, with severe financial and even criminal penalties for those who do not.\n“And the government needs to properly fund and conduct enforcement of laws already in place to protect workers from wage exploitation and dangerous working conditions. At the moment enforcement is a sham: over a three-year period in Leicester, only 60 health and safety inspections and 28 fire safety inspections have taken place among more than 1,000 Leicester garment factories.\n“During the same period, HMRC made just 36 investigations into failures to pay the legally required national minimum wage. I have called in Parliament for urgent new legislation to introduce a garment trade adjudicator or fashion watchdog to hold brands to proper ethical and sustainable standards.”\nAbout the BBC’s allegations, a Boohoo spokeman said: “Alison Levitt KC conducted an independent review and made a number of recommendations to improve working conditions and transparency. We have implemented every one of these recommendations including improving corporate governance, strengthening the ethical and compliance obligations on those wishing to supply Boohoo, regularly publishing our full list of approved global manufacturers, and more.\n“We will continue to deliver on the commitments we’ve made.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_icj-israel-must-stop-genocidal-acts-in-gaza/content_794.html": "ICJ: Israel must stop genocidal acts in Gaza\n…but international court stops short of calling for a ceasefire in Palestine\nLEFT MPs demanded Britain stopped arming Israel after a top international court ordered Tel Aviv today to take steps to limit killings and acts of genocide — but stopped short of insisting on a ceasefire.\nIn the highly anticipated decision made by a panel of 17 judges, the International Court of Justice decided not to throw out the case brought by South Africa as the Israelis had demanded.\nPresident of the court Judge Joan E Donoghue said: “South Africa has standing to submit to it the dispute with Israel concerning alleged violations of obligations under the Genocide Convention.”\nBefore issuing the judgement Judge Donoghue said: “The court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering.”\nThe court ruled that Israel must do all it can to prevent genocide, including refraining from killing Palestinians or causing harm to them.\nIt also said it wanted to see urgent steps taken to get basic aid to people in Gaza and that Israel should prevent and punish any incitement to genocide, among other measures.\nThe court said Israel must submit a report to the court on measures taken within a month.\nDespite the ICJ falling short of calling out for a ceasefire in Gaza, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister issued an angry response to the judgement, denouncing the court as “anti-semitic.”\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: “The charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it.”\nBut a statement from Hamas welcomed the court’s “important” ruling, saying it “contributes to isolating Israel.”\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Maliki said: “Palestine welcomes the significant order by the International Court of Justice in South Africa’s case against Israel under the Genocide Convention.\n“The ICJ ruling is an important reminder that no state is above the law or beyond the reach of justice.”\nSpeaking on the steps of the seat of the ICJ, South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said Israel will have to halt fighting in Gaza if it wants to adhere to the orders of the UN’s top court.\n“How do you provide aid and water without a ceasefire?” Ms Pandor said. “If you read the order, by implication a ceasefire must happen.”\nLabour MP for Leeds East Richard Burgon demanded a halt to arms sales to Israel.\nHe said: “Our government has a clear obligation to ensure it does nothing to aid Israel’s war on Gaza. It should start by suspending arms sales to Israel.”\nAnd Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe told the Morning Star that she agreed with the need to stop all arms sales to Israel and congratulated South Africa for being brave enough to bring the case “when many of the world’s so-called ‘leading’ nations either sat on their hands while civilians, mostly women and children, were slaughtered, or, worse still, actively participated or supported Israel’s actions.”\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also congratulated South Africa for bringing the case. “If our political leaders respected international law, they would call for the unconditional fulfilment of the provisional measures, and demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,” he urged.\nScottish First Minister Humza Yousaf wrote on X: “With such death and destruction, we will continue to call for an immediate ceasefire.”\nFiona Edwards of No Cold War Britain said: “Only an immediate and permanent ceasefire can stop Israel committing further crimes against humanity.”\nIslamic Relief said they were praying “that world leaders are listening and will now finally act to save lives. Alongside the provisional measures that the ICJ ordered today, there must be an immediate ceasefire.”\nManolo De Los Santos, founder of the New York-based People’s Forum, called the ICJ ruling “a major political defeat for Israel. Its genocidal war crimes are officially on the record now. A court ruling wasn’t going to stop the war on Gaza but it’s a win in the struggle for Palestine.\n“Only the struggle of the Palestinian people and massive international pressure will end zionism.”\nThe International Coalition to Stop Genocide in Palestine said the Israelis have made repeated declarations that they intend to ignore the ruling, so governments must “hold Israeli war criminals to account for their genocide.”\nIrish MEP Mick Wallace called the ruling a huge defeat for Israel and said “they must now act to ensure that Palestinians are no longer at risk of harm and genocidal acts. Nations facilitating Israel’s war must stop.”\nMeanwhile the relentless bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza continued.\nIsrael launched its massive air and ground assault on Gaza after Hamas’s surprise attack on October 7 which killed about 1,200 Israelis and saw another 250 taken hostage.\nThe offensive has destroyed vast swathes of the territory and driven nearly 85 per cent of its 2.3 million people from their homes.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll, mostly women and children, was now over 26,000.\nUN officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.\nIsraeli air strikes on the Nuseirat urban refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip killed at least 15 people today, including a five-month-old baby.\nIn southern Gaza, Israeli forces pushed further into the city of Khan Younis, where the intensity of the fighting has increased in recent days.\nThe Israeli military today ordered residents of three neighbourhoods and the Khan Younis refugee camp to evacuate to a coastal area.\nThe camp, like others in Gaza, was initially settled by Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and has since been built up into a district of the wider city.\nBut some argue that the latest attack is another act of collective punishment by the Israelis as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, and the commander of the group’s military wing, Mohammed Deif, both grew up in the Khan Younis refugee camp.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-climate-crisis-is-a-class-crisis/content_477.html": "The climate crisis is a class crisis\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nTo tackle the threat of environmental disaster, the super-rich must dramatically change their lifestyles, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nWITH the highest-ever temperatures recorded in the Arctic Circle, and with just 3 per cent of the world’s ecosystems remaining intact, we cannot delay in taking action to save our planet and future generations.\nYet sadly it is not true that we are all in this crisis together — or that we are all equally culpable when it comes to contributing to environmental breakdown.\nThe world’s wealthiest 1 per cent produce twice as much carbon emissions as the poorest 50 per cent, according to a report published this week.\nAccording to the Cambridge Sustainability Commission on Scaling Behaviour Change, the wealthiest citizens, the “polluter elite,” must make the most dramatic changes to their lifestyles to keep the 1.5°C target alive.\nTo meet this target, seen by scientists as a crucial tipping point after which environmental devastation will be locked in, the richest 1 per cent of the global population needs to reduce their emissions by a factor of at least 30 by 2030, while the poorest 50 per cent of humanity could increase their emissions by three times their current level.\nThe report also found that the total growth in absolute emissions was due to the richest 10 per cent, with the richest 5 per cent alone contributing over a third.\nThe report concludes that a combination of individual and systemic efforts to dramatically reduce the carbon footprints of the richest and to build affordable and low-carbon infrastructures around housing, transport and energy for all to access offers the best way forward.\nIts sensible recommendations include frequent flyer levies, bans on selling and promoting SUVs and other high-polluting vehicles, reversing the recent government announcement to cut green grants for homes and electric cars and building just transitions from fossil fuels by supporting electric public transport and community energy schemes.\nThere is an abundance of evidence that the super-rich disproportionately contribute to climate change.\nJust last month, the British organisation Possible reported that in almost all countries with the highest aviation emissions, a small minority of people take up a huge share of the flights.\nIn the UK, for instance, a mere 15 per cent of the population take 70 per cent of all flights.\nThis means that wealthier people are disproportionately responsible for emissions that are already causing harm to people around the world, with the effects falling most heavily on poorer communities and global South countries.\nA study by Linnaeus University in Sweden last November found that frequent flying “super-emitters,” who represent just 1 per cent of the world’s population, caused half of aviation’s carbon emissions in 2018. In that same year, 90 per cent of the world’s population did not fly at all.\nLast year, Oxfam published research which found that, between 1990 and 2015, the wealthiest 1 per cent of the world’s population were responsible for the emission of more than twice as much carbon dioxide as the poorer half of the world.\nCarbon dioxide emissions rose by 60 per cent over the 25-year period, but the increase in emissions from the richest 1 per cent was three times greater than the increase in emissions from the poorest half.\nThis reflects staggering levels of global inequality. The world’s richest 1 per cent have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people, while almost half of humanity is living on less than $5.50 a day.\nThe world literally cannot sustain this level of gross injustice. To protect our planet, we must abolish the obscene wealth of the ultra-rich.\nWithout immediate government intervention, the urgent action required to preserve a habitable planet will be too slow.\nThis will cause unimaginable disruption and could cost millions of lives, most immediately and sharply in global South countries which have contributed the least to climate change.\nThe upcoming COP26 conference in Glasgow, scheduled for November, provides a crucial opportunity to address this existential threat.\nYet the conference, which already had to be postponed for one year due to the coronavirus, risks excluding representatives from countries that are most at risk from climate breakdown.\nThis is partly because poorer countries in the global South do not have the same access to vaccinations, which demonstrates how the coronavirus and climate crises intersect.\nIndeed, richer countries, including Britain, have secured over three times more vaccines than they need to treat their entire populations, while 67 of the poorest countries will only be able to vaccinate one in 10 of their population over the next year.\nMuch of Africa, for instance, is not expected to have vaccines widely available until 2023.\nIn the build-up to November, we on the left must demand that every possible step is taken to ensure that COP26 is accessible for all.\nI am also gravely concerned that, if fossil fuel companies are left to their own devices, crucial targets will be missed.\nFor example, ExxonMobil is projected to extract 25 per cent more oil and gas in 2025 than in 2017.\nOil companies like Exxon and Shell knew that their extractive industries were causing climate change as far back as the 1980s, but instead of informing the public they funded climate change denial and lobbying against environmental policies.\nA 2017 study in the scientific publication World Development found that worldwide fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $4.9 trillion in a single year.\nIt estimated that eliminating those subsidies would have cut global carbon emissions by 21 per cent and air pollution deaths by over half.\nIt is vital that these subsidies are ended, and that coronavirus bailouts are subject to stringent commitments to workers’ rights, tax justice and rapid decarbonisation\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, we must argue for a new social settlement — a Green New Deal to rebuild the country with a more just and sustainable economy.\nWe must fight for a society in which public health always comes before private profit.\nWe must consider a sector-wide aviation deal, including public stakes in failing airlines, to manage a just transition to renewable energy.\nReduced air traffic due to the pandemic must also be a turning point, and frequent flier levies must finally be introduced.\nWe must also call for a green, integrated public transport for the many. Railways should be nationalised, electrified, expanded and affordable.\nZero-emission, regular buses should serve every community, operated for the public good, not private profit. Our streets must be clean, safe, walking and cycle friendly.\nIt is vital that the protection of all workers and communities are guaranteed during the transition to renewable energies.\nThe required investment and job creation towards a green industrial revolution will also be vital in the necessary post-coronavirus mass re-employment.\nTo ensure a global Green New Deal, we must call for the cancellation of global South debt to enable investment in public health.\nBritain must take strong action against tax evasion, end international fossil fuel finance and rapidly step up financial support for a just global energy transition.\nThe current pandemic has demonstrated that we are only as secure as the most precarious among us and that rapid social and economic change really is possible.\nMoments of crises often shape the future. From the horror of the second world war, we created the welfare state and our treasured NHS.\nWhile we rightly focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, the wellbeing of the entire planet relies on us also taking this opportunity to mitigate the existential threat of climate change. We must not let this historic moment pass us by.\nThe climate crisis is a class crisis. It must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs, not ordinary people.\nUltimately, the lifestyles of the ultra-rich are incompatible with climate justice. We cannot tackle climate change without addressing rampant global inequality.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_thousands-pay-tribute-at-funeral-of-revered-city-iman/content_480.html": "Thousands pay tribute at funeral of revered city iman\nTRIBUTES have been paid to a leading imam, who has died aged 86.\nShaykh Adam had been imam at Jame Masjid in Leicester since 1977.\nHis funeral took place yesterday, beginning with thousands of people gathering for prayers in Spinney Hill Park.\nAmong them was Muhammed Patel, 36, who lives nearby. He said: “It’s a huge loss.\n“He was really the first religious figure in Leicester for Muslims and, looking around today, it’s good to see so many people.\n“People have come from all over the country.\n“He did my graduation 10 years ago when I had to memorise the Quran from cover to cover and he also did my sister’s graduation when she became a female scholar.\n“My sister was part of a cohort of girls empowered at a time when girls were questioning what direction to go in life.\n“He encouraged them to follow what they believe in.”\nVaidhussen Acbaraly, 36, who lives in Spinney Hills, said: “It was amazing to have such a nice farewell to the imam.\n“He was a very nice, gentle man and everyone appreciated his service over many years.\n“He’s been working here in Leicester for so long and done so much.”\nMohammad Patel, 30, of Evington, said: “I met the imam when I was younger and he was very nice. He was a very kind man.\n“He was inspiring and very active in the community.”\nThe Federation of Muslim Organisations said the death of Hazrat Shaykh Maulana Muhammad Adam Saheb was “a significant loss for the Muslim community in Leicester and beyond”.\nIt paid tribute to him as a “towering figure of wisdom, compassion and guidance”.\nBorn in Manekpore in Gujarat, India, Shaykh Adam lost his mother when he was 10.\nHe was educated at the Islamic seminary Jame’ah Islamiyya in Dabhel, India, and in Deoband Islamic University. He moved to the UK in 1975.\nThe federation said: “The establishment of the Muslim Girls’ High School in Leicester in 1981 stands in many forms as a testament to his vision for nurturing the minds and souls of future generations.\n“His dedication to education knew no bounds, as evidenced by the constellation of Jameah institutions and other organisations, which stand today as a beacon of knowledge and enlightenment for thousands.\n“But perhaps, it is not merely his scholarly achievements that we remember today.\n“It is his humility, his compassion and his unwavering devotion to serving humanity that truly set him apart.\n“As a spiritual leader, he guided countless souls on the path of selfdiscovery and inner peace, reminding us all of the transformative power of faith and spiritual love.\n“As we lay Hazrat Shaykh Maulana Muhammad Adam Saheb to rest, let us carry forward his legacy of compassion, wisdom and service to others.”\nLeicester East MP Claudia Webbe described Shaykh Adam as a “revered figure in Leicester and beyond” and praised his “kindness and humility and his efforts to promote education and the wellbeing of others”.\nShe said: “He was likely the longest-serving imam in the UK, in excess of 40 years, and he contributed so much to the education of countless students in Leicester.\n“The strength of his faith and the power of his knowledge was passed on through generations he taught.\n“His vision, commitment and love for people was almost unparalleled.”\nSuleman Nagdi, of the Federation of Muslim Organisations, said: “I would like to thank our local authority, police and all agencies that helped facilitate the large funeral.\n“I would also take this opportunity to also thank our local diverse community for graciously accommodating us during the solemn occasion.\n“Your kindness and generosity have helped us honour our loved one’s memory in a meaningful way.\n“May the collective strength of our community continue to provide solace and healing to all those affected.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_migrants-are-not-the-problem-this-reactionary-government-is/content_139.html": "Migrants are not the problem, this reactionary Government is\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nClaudia Webbe MP writes on why we must resist Tory divide & rule\n”The attacks on the living conditions of the majority of people we have seen are not from refugees fleeing persecution, death & famine. They are from the billionaires who stash their wealth in tax havens & the Tory Government that represents their interests” says Claudia Webbe MP\nWe have increasingly seen the Tory government resort to scapegoating in recent weeks, especially with regards to migrants, including refugees attempting to cross the channel.\nThese now daily attacks from the Tories and their allies in the right-wing media on refugees fleeing famine, war and persecution must not only be opposed by socialists – not least due to the lack of humanity, compassion and dignity they represent – but we must also understand why they are taking place at this particular time.\nWhy then is this callous Tory government launching a war against migrants in rubber dinghies with no regard to protect human life?\nThis is classic Tory divide and rule, and the reasons are clear and are political.\nThis scapegoating is all about distracting public attention (and diverting public anger) from the Government’s mishandling of the Coronavirus, which led us to the worst death rate in Europe, and its failure to take the radical action now necessary to protect as many jobs and livelihoods as possible.\nHow many people died from Covid-19 was not inevitable. The reason it happened was because the Tory government was ill-prepared in vital areas of public health, including being too late to lockdown, and has consistently refused to put the interests of people and public health before the interests of big business.\nThe level of deep recession we are starting to experience is also not inevitable.\nWith regards to the current offensive around people crossing the channel, it is imperative that progressives and anti-racists lay out the facts on this issue, including with regards to why the idea that refugees get an “easy ride” once they reach here is blatantly untrue. The current support for asylum seekers – £37.75 a week – and the ban on their right to work is inhumane.\nIn so much of the discourse on this issue there has not even been a cursory mention of the legal right for refugees to claim asylum in the UK and the need to meet our international obligations when it comes to welcoming them.\nThis must change, and we should also not forget that through the reactionary role it plays on the international stage, this Tory Government has contributed to the global refugee crisis.\nIndeed, despite the Coronavirus pandemic the UK, is still trading arms and deploying troops in war torn areas like the Yemen from where many refugees flee. The fact that it is often our aggressive wars – or wars fought with weapons sold by us – that forces these people to flee their homelands gives us a special responsibility.\nA failure to implement both a global ceasefire and debt cancellation are part of the problem. The UK is a major shareholder and complicit in both, but this could and should end.\nWe also need to recognise that the deepening global climate emergency, unless averted by urgent action, will mean further crises causing there to be more and more climate refugees around the world.\nThe attacks on the living conditions of the majority of people we have seen in recent years – with the Tories threatening more in the years to come – are not from refugees fleeing persecution, death and famine. They are from the billionaires who stash their wealth in tax havens, and the Tory Government that represents their interests.\nFearmongering over an invasion of ‘illegal immigrants’ across the Channel must be resisted. And we should always remember that migrants are not the problem, this reactionary Government is.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_extreme-heat-must-act-as-a-wake-up-call/content_871.html": "Extreme heat must act as a wake-up call\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nSoaring temperatures in the last week or so demonstrate the real and present danger faced by communities across the world. The time for climate action is now, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST week, Britain smashed its previous record temperatures. Thermometers hit 40.3°C at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, while 33 other locations went past Britain’s previous highest temperature of 38.7°C, set in 2019.\nPerhaps most concerning is the extent to which the records were broken — meteorologists who are used to records being broken by the smallest decimal points expressed surprise that the record was beaten so clearly and across so many areas.\nThe heatwave has caused a great deal of disruption. Leicestershire fire services declared a number of “major incidents” and London firefighters had their busiest day since the second world war.\nRail services were heavily impacted by the extreme heat, with the East Coast Main Line shut due to record temperatures.\nContrary to the nonsensical argument by some Conservative MPs that concern about the heatwaves are evidence of “snowflakes,” and a decreasingly resilient national spirit, it is important to remember that this is not a once-in-a-generation occurrence, but rather the grim sign of things to come.\nThis is also a gravely serious matter in the here and now; at least 748 heat-related deaths have been reported in the heatwave in Spain and Portugal, and in the UK around 2,000 extra deaths in England are related to heat waves each year.\nMore than 31,000 people have been forced from their homes and summer holiday spots in the Gironde region of France since the wildfires began July 12.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1°C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nMuch of Europe and north Africa has also experienced extreme heat, with wildfires breaking out in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Morocco.\nThe Met Office chief of science and technology Prof Stephen Belcher said exceeding 40 degrees was “virtually impossible” in an undisrupted climate, but due to climate change “driven by greenhouse gasses” such extreme temperatures had become a reality.\nHe also predicted that, if there continued to be high emissions, “we could see temperatures like this every three years.”\nThere have been wildfires and mass displacements across Europe this week, and 11 of the continents’ 12 warmest years have occurred in the past two decades.\nGlobal grain yields have declined by 10 per cent from heatwaves and floods connected to climate change, unleashing mass hunger and displacement.\nOver one million people living near coasts have been forced from their homes due to rising seas and stronger storms, and millions more are expected to flee in the coming years.\nThe excessive heat in the last week or so demonstrates the real and present danger faced by communities across the world. We cannot delay in taking action to save our planet and future generations.\nIt is therefore gravely concerning that our next prime minister, be it either the millionaire Rishi Sunak or corporation tax-cut fanatic Liz Truss, have shown scant interest in the climate emergency.\nBoth have barely discussed climate change as part of their leadership campaigns. Yet this should hardly come as a surprise, when we consider that the incredibly small electorate of Conservative Party members could not care less about environmental breakdown.\nAccording to a recent YouGov poll, only 4 per cent of Conservative Party members put reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 in their top three priorities.\nOut of 10 policy areas, net-zero came bottom in the YouGov poll of Conservative members — while winning the next election and controlling immigration were two of the three most popular.\nSadly, we cannot rely on this government to take the urgent, radical action that is required to mitigate climate breakdown. Not only is its commitment to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 perilously unambitious, but it is not even on track to meet it.\nThe 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — seen by scientists as a tipping point past which climate disasters will be locked in — then oil and gas production have to fall by 20 per cent by 2030.\nA 2017 study in the scientific publication World Development found that worldwide fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $4.9 trillion in a single year.\nIt estimated that eliminating those subsidies would have cut global carbon emissions by 21 per cent and air pollution deaths by over half. It is vital that these subsidies are ended.\nWe must build a new social settlement — a Green New Deal to rebuild the country with a more just and sustainable economy, where the measure of progress is not financial wealth but our climate wellbeing.\nWe must fight for a society in which public health always comes before private profit. It must be the big polluters and corporate giants who bear the costs, not ordinary people.\nWe must introduce a programme of investment in renewable energy, flood defences and a resilient health and care service — funded by taxes on the ultra-rich and big business.\nWhile the heatwaves in Britain and across Europe have been deeply concerning, they have been merely a temporary glimpse into the devastating reality facing communities in the global South.\nIn much of the global South, far more intense and longer-lasting heatwaves, droughts and crop failures are becoming the new normal, driving up hunger and poverty and particularly affecting the most vulnerable.\nTo give just two examples, northern Kenya is facing a prolonged drought that is putting rural communities at greater risk of starvation and last year, torrential rains left one-quarter of Bangladesh under water and destroyed the homes of millions.\nGiven the historical context of colonialism, underdevelopment and wealth extraction, it is morally abhorrent that 3.6 billion people in developing countries are already bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.\nWithout immediate intervention from wealthier countries including Britain, the urgent action required to preserve a habitable planet will be too slow.\nThis will cause unimaginable disruption and could cost millions of lives, most immediately and sharply in countries which have contributed the least to climate change.\nIt is high time for rich countries in North America and Europe to step up and face reality with a global programme to save lives and ensure a sustainable future.\nAccording to Carbon Brief, with 1.5°C of warming global sea levels will rise by 48cm by the end of this century, compared to 56cm if we hit 2 degrees.\nEight cm may not sound like a lot, but it means the difference between life and death for millions of people. According to the IPCC, every 10cm of sea-level rise affects up to another 10 million people around the world.\nThe Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports that hundreds of thousands of people are already being displaced every year by floods in low-lying areas of Bangladesh.\nThe truth is that our global future is incompatible with our current economic system that has enriched the ever-shrinking few at the expense of the many — and our planet.\nThis was hammered home by a report released by Oxfam during Cop26, which found that the carbon footprints of the richest 1 per cent of people on Earth are set to be 30 times greater than the level compatible with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement in 2030.\nThe conclusions from this are clear. To tackle climate change we must end extreme global inequality and rebuild a world based on equity and sustainability.\nIn the short term, it is also vital that wealthy countries — including Britain — write off debt for countries in the global South and allow them to prioritise their response to climate breakdown.\nThe pandemic has pushed poor countries into record levels of debt. The Jubilee Network found that countries were forced to spend $372 billion on servicing debt last year alone and that 34 of the world’s poorest countries are spending £21.4bn on debt payments a year compared with £3.9bn on measures to tackle the climate emergency.\nLow-income countries are responsible for less than 1 per cent of the world’s historic carbon emissions while rich countries like Britain industrialised and became prosperous on the back of vast emissions.\nThe average person in Britain emits more carbon in the first two weeks of the year than the average person does in a whole year in countries like Rwanda, Malawi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Madagascar, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\nWe must end this historical injustice. We must ensure that the equivocating, the inadequate proposals, and the empty rhetoric of polluting countries is replaced by immediate action.\nAbove all else, we must ensure that the recent extreme heat serves as a wake-up call to usher in radical, properly funded policies to mitigate the immense human cost of climate change across the world.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_truth-before-trade/content_385.html": "Truth before trade\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Britain-India trade deal must stop until the truth is known about the anti-Sikh murder campaign, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nON JUNE 18 last year, a white car matched the movement of a pick-up truck driven by Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian national and Sikh activist, as it crossed the car park of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia.\nAs Nijjar’s truck reached the car park exit the white car cut him off, preventing him from driving out and forcing him to stop. As his vehicle came to a halt, two men on foot approached the driver’s window and shot him, firing around 50 bullets before running off and getting into the white car before it sped away. Nijjar died of his wounds.\nWe know this because the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has just released CCTV footage showing the complex and highly organised manoeuvres involved in his assassination. At least six men and two vehicles took part.\nThe murder sparked a diplomatic row between Canada and India. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the murder, saying that his nation’s security services were investigating “credible allegations” of Indian state involvement and calling on India to co-operate in Canada’s investigation. Jagmeet Singh, leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be held accountable.\nThe Canadian government reportedly obtained a list of around 20 names, plus that of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, of so called “Khalistan activists” that were also likely targets. Some of those named live in Britain.\nThe day after Nijjar’s murder, according to the US government’s November 2023 indictment against Nikhil Gupta, Gupta tried to procure the assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a leading US-based Sikh advocate for the secession of Punjab from India to create a Sikh sovereign state of Khalistan in Punjab.\nThe undercover agent that he thought was a hit-man reported that Gupta told him that Pannun’s killing was part of a broad campaign of planned assassinations and that Nijjar’s murder was part of the campaign. Gupta has claimed that he was acting on the instructions of an Indian intelligence officer known as “CC1.”\nIn response to Nijjar’s murder and the allegations surrounding it, so far the British government has stated that the events would have “no impact” on Britain’s ongoing trade talks with the Modi government.\nAround the same time as the murder of Nijjar and the plot against Pannun, Birmingham Sikh activist Avtar Singh Kanda complained that Indian police were verbally harassing him by phone and threatening his family in Punjab. He died suddenly. The British authorities have said that he died of sudden acute myeloid leukaemia, but his family believe his death to be suspicious.\nThe British government is still pursuing what it claims is a “really huge” trade deal with India, yet is failing to use the opportunity — one of the few concrete chances it has — to apply pressure to the Indian government on its human rights record generally or the issue of the assassination campaign in particular. India wants more visas for Indian workers and an agreement on social security payments — these could be used as leverage if the government was interested in doing so.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi denied any involvement of the Indian government in the murders and assassination attempts and said he would “look into” the alleged involvement of an Indian intelligence operative.\nTwo months after Nijjar’s murder, Canadian police arrived at the home of Gurmeet Singh Toor, a friend of Nijjar and a fellow proponent of a separate homeland for Sikhs and handed him a “duty to warn” notice informing him that his life was also in danger. Toor asked them who was threatening his life. He said that “they said they couldn’t explain the threats for ‘security reasons.’ But they told me they had information that I was in danger.”\nAt the same time that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was releasing the CCTV footage of the “complex and highly organised” murder of Nijjar, the UK Sikh Federation published a post on its Twitter/X feed alleging that “evidence suggests” that Modi had “personally sanctioned” the assassination campaign.\nThe federation’s post stated: “We believe the US has sufficient evidence to show the Indian PM, Narendra Modi on the advice of his National Security Adviser… personally sanctioned the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief… to carry out the assassination of Sikh activists in the West campaigning for a Sikh homeland. The US, the other Five Eyes nations [which include the UK] and allies in Europe know they have a massive dilemma with those directing the assassinations from Delhi.”\nAt the time of writing, Modi does not appear to have responded specifically to the Sikh Federation’s allegations.\nThe notion of Khalistan is the backdrop to these allegations. Both Hardeep Singh Nijjar and Gurpatwant Singh Pannun had been condemned as “terrorists” by the Modi government for their activism for the creation of a Sikh sovereign state, activism that has been made illegal in India and brutally repressed.\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both condemned the “impunity” afforded to security services for alleged mass killings of independence activists and torture and detention without trial of others. Support for Khalistan independence has grown among Sikh diaspora communities, including in my constituency of Leicester East, in an apparent response to this military repression. It is my view that those that peacefully support Khalistan and a referendum on independence are not terrorists, and should not be labelled as such, let alone killed.\nA further factor in India’s reaction to the Khalistan separatist movement is the ongoing strike and protests by mostly Sikh farmers in Punjab. The strike is a renewal of the highly effective 2021 farmers’ strike, which forced the Indian government into a major climbdown over planned measures the farmers said would impoverish them.\nDespite the Indian constitution’s guarantees of freedom of assembly and the right to protest, attempts by demonstrators to reach the Indian capital New Delhi with their farm tractor protests have been met by police and military using drones, tear gas, rubber bullets and, increasingly, metal pellets fired at protesters, blinding several. Pro-government Indian media have accused pro-Khalistan leaders — including Gurpatwant Singh Pannun — of inciting the farmers and stirring unrest for political ends, in what appears to be an attempt to smear both the farmers and the Sikh independence movement by association with each other.\nThe new video evidence published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the allegations of the Sikh Federation in Britain raise serious questions about the actions of the Indian government, in other sovereign states, against Sikh activists.\nThe British government must come clean about what it knows about India’s involvement in the deaths and attempted murder of Sikh activists, whether in Britain or elsewhere — and if it knows nothing, it must demand answers of the Indian government and the trade deal must be put on hold until they are received.\nBritain must not stand by if there is any chance that India is targeting Sikhs for assassination. Trade talks cannot be prioritised above justice and the safety of Sikh diaspora communities.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_british-mp-webbe-who-filed-a-complaint-with-the-icc-for-israels-prosecution-spoke-to-aa/content_176.html": "British MP Webbe, who filed a complaint with the ICC for Israel’s prosecution, spoke to AA\nBritish MP Claudia Webbe, who filed an official complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC), said that those involved in the attacks in Gaza and Israel’s international accomplices should be tried in criminal courts.\nWebbe, an independent MP in the British parliament, made evaluations to the AA correspondent regarding the destruction caused by Israel’s attacks in Gaza, the humanitarian crisis, and the allegations that Britain is Israel’s accomplice due to its political and military support.\nWebbe stated that the situation in Gaza is devastating and pointed out that Israel’s attacks against the people of Gaza, which have been continuing for more than 160 days, are of terrible magnitude.\nEmphasizing that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) determined that these attacks carried a reasonable risk of genocide, Webbe said, “We are in the month of Ramadan. There is neither a break nor a ceasefire. This is absolutely devastating.” he said.\nWebbe stated that Israel uses hunger as a “weapon of war” and that bombardments and air strikes against civilians in Gaza continue, adding that people are losing their lives in Gaza every day and that women and children are especially affected by this situation.\n“This is horrifying and it is absolutely horrifying that we are witnessing this in real time.” Webbe stated that a clear call for a ceasefire should be made and a serious call should be made to Israel to end the bombardment and oppression against the people of Gaza.\n”Those involved in acts of attack should be brought before criminal courts”\nBritish MP Webbe made the following evaluations regarding the official complaint he filed with the ICC in December 2023, calling for the investigation and prosecution of war crimes committed by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people, including genocide and crimes against humanity:\n“I believe in the people of Gaza that those who are involved in acts of attack against civilians should be brought before criminal courts and held accountable for their actions and decisions. Therefore, I call on the Israeli government, those in key roles, including (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, and his entire cabinet, to be complicit in these murders, directing the murders.” “I hold them responsible for causing harm to the people of Gaza.”\n”It is clear that Britain is an accomplice”\nRegarding the allegations that Israel is an accomplice, citing the political and military support that Britain has provided to Israel, Webbe said: “Britain has not only been protecting Israel since October 7, but has also been attacking Israel for a while.” “It is clear that he is also complicit in the ongoing arms supply.” said.\nUnderlining that Britain should stop arming Israel, Webbe stated that his country, on the other hand, gave arms sales licenses to Israel and continued to provide military aid.\nWebbe stated that these actions of the UK amount to complicity in the genocide committed against the civilian population in Gaza, and this must stop now.\nThe British parliamentarian said, “For this reason, international actors must hold countries such as the UK and the USA to account for their actions. England is complicit with the USA by following the actions of the USA against the people of Gaza.” he said.\nWebbe also called on the British government to stop the bloodshed in Gaza and concluded his words as follows:\n“The British government must immediately stop arms aid to Israel. It must immediately impose sanctions. It must restart its financing of the United Nations (UN) Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which will provide the necessary food and resources to the people of Gaza. It must do this immediately.”\nBritish MP Webbe reviewed AA’s book “Evidence”\nAfter the interview, Webbe reviewed Anadolu Agency’s (AA) book “Evidence”, which contains documentary photographs of Israel’s war crimes, especially the use of white phosphorus in its attacks on Gaza.\nWebbe, who was informed that AA had documented the violations in Gaza and brought them to the attention of the international public with this book, later commented on some of the photographs in the book.\nExamining a photo showing that Palestinians, who were subjected to violent attacks by the Israeli army, migrated to the southern regions, Webbe said, “This is absolutely terrible. It is like the new Nakba. It is the continuation of the Nakba. 75 years have passed since the Nakba.” he said.\nWebbe then thanked the book and all the work done in its preparation.\nThe book “Evidence” documents Israel’s crimes\nWhile most countries, especially Western countries, remained silent about the attacks carried out by Israel indiscriminately against women and children in Gaza, some countries put forward the thesis of “lack of evidence” for the massacres.\nFollowing the allegations in question, AA decided to compile the images of photojournalists and cameramen who have played an important role since the beginning of the attacks, in order to serve as evidence in international law.\nThe book, prepared in Turkish, English and Arabic by an expert team, was published under the name “evidence”. In Evidence, the crimes against humanity committed by Israel in Gaza were revealed with documentary photographs.\nPhotographs of white phosphorus artillery shells used by the Israeli army in densely populated civilian areas of Gaza, the use of which is a crime according to the UN Conventional Weapons Convention, were also included in the book.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_postal-workers-strike-in-pay-dispute/content_919.html": "Postal workers strike in pay dispute\nLeicester’s Royal Mail staff took to the picket line on Friday morning to protest the low pay rise offered to the company’s workers.\nWhile the company says it has offered staff a pay rise of 5.5 per cent, the Communication Workers Union says it actually equals a 2 per cent pay rise, with an additional 1.5 per cent if they agree to changes to the worker’s terms and conditions, and a bonus of £500.\nLarge crowds of workers gathered at picket lines both at the customer entrance on Meridian East and the postal van entrance on Centurion Way, with picket supervisor John Wilkinson saying that more than 200 workers were striking today in Leicester as part of the pay dispute.\nHe said: “We’ve done two ballots for industrial action, one about pay and one about terms, but today’s strike is about pay. Royal Mail has imposed a 2 per cent pay rise but offered us more if we changed our worker’s terms and conditions, as well as a bonus scheme.\n“But 2 per cent is not good enough for our members, it’s insulting to the hard work they put into this job and the magnificent service they provide all year round.\n“Royal Mail have pulled away from all talks and, unfortunately, until we can get them back around the table, the strikes will continue.\n“There has been massive support for the strike action in Leicester, it’s the biggest delivery office in the country and we have one of the largest number of supporters to the strikes – totalling around 200 members of staff.\n“Unfortunately CEO Simon Thompson has been making some unusual comments in regards to resolving the issue, and we will continue to strike until Royal Mail return to negotiations.\n“The last thing our members want to do is to take industrial action, to be a postie is not just a job, it’s a vocation. We care about our job and the communities we serve.\n“But when our pay and the public service is being ripped up by the company, we have to take a stand.”\nMr Wilkinson also pointed out the £400 million which was paid out to shareholders last year, as well as an additional £130 million pay-out which was decided at the company’s most recent AGM.\nThe striking staff were joined by Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe, who offered her solidarity to the cause.\nShe said: “I’m here because I believe that the role of MPs is to stand at the picket line, speak with local workers, and help them fight for fairer wages.\n“2 per cent is straight out of the poverty playbook, the money won’t even cover a fraction of the cost of living crisis. Our posties were praised during the pandemic, standing firm and continuing to deliver mail and keeping the country going.\n“They were applauded on doorsteps, and now they’re being treated badly when they need help to get through this crisis.\n“We should be fighting for wages in line and above inflation, I’ve been speaking to a lot of people here and a lot of them are on the cusp of going to food banks or go there already. The workers aren’t deciding heating or eating, they’re at risk of not doing either this winter, especially with the increasing energy bills announced today.\n“The workers need a significant pay rise, anything lower than inflation still leaves them out of pocket and worse off than before.\n“Royal Mail is a British institution and it’s shocking to see its staff treated this way, and is just further proof that it should be brought back into public ownership.”\nA spokesperson for Royal Mail said: “Today’s CWU strike thrusts Royal Mail into the most uncertain time of its 500-year history. It is putting jobs at risk and making pay rises less affordable. We are losing £1 million a day. We must change to fix the situation and protect high quality jobs.\n“The change we need is the change the public demand of us. They want more and bigger parcels delivered the next day – including Sundays – and more environmentally friendly options. They want this at a competitive price, with great quality of service. We cannot cling to outdated working practices, ignoring technological advancements and pretending that Covid has not significantly changed what the public wants from Royal Mail.\n“While our competitors work seven days a week, delivering until 10 pm to meet customer demand, the CWU want to work fewer hours, six days a week, starting and finishing earlier. Their plans to transform Royal Mail come with a £1 billion price tag, are predicated on a wholly unrealistic revival in letter writing, and prevent Royal Mail from growing, and remaining competitive, in a fast-moving industry. The CWU’s vision for Royal Mail would create a vicious spiral of falling volumes, higher prices, bigger losses, and fewer jobs.\n“Our future is as a parcels business. We must adapt old ways of working designed for letters to a world increasingly dominated by parcels, and we must act fast. We want to protect well-paid, permanent jobs long-term and retain our place as the industry leader on pay, terms and conditions. That is in the best interests of Royal Mail and all its employees.\n“We apologise to our customers, and the public for the inconvenience the CWU’s strike action will cause. We have offered to meet the CWU numerous times in recent weeks, but they declined each invitation, preferring to spend their time on the political agenda of the UK trade union movement. We remain ready to talk with the CWU to try and avert damaging industrial action and prevent significant inconvenience for customers. But any talks must be about both change and pay.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

Ms Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, has been suspended from the Labour Party over a letter on racism which she wrote for the Observer.\nShe said, while white people “undoubtedly experience prejudice” which is “similar to racism”, they “are not all their lives subject to racism” and referenced the Irish, Travellers and Jews as examples. Her remarks, published yesterday, caused Labour to suspend Ms Abbott, saying they were “deeply offensive and wrong”.\nMs Abbott publicly apologised yesterday morning for “the anguish caused by her remarks” and “unreservedly withdrew them”, saying it was an early draft of her letter which was published. Independent MP for Leicester East Claudia Webbe said she stands in “solidarity” with the suspended MP and said “the pile on against her must stop” in a Tweet last night.\nConservative MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston Neil O’Brien also waded into the debate. He said: “Labour MP Diane Abbott argues that white people can’t experience racism – her absurd claim that the Jews have never experienced racism will appal survivors of the Holocaust.”\nThe letter published by the Observer came in response to a piece by writer Tomiwa Owolade in the Guardian which questioned the view that racism “only affects people of colour”. It read: “Tomiwa Owolade claims that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people all suffer from “racism”.\n“They undoubtedly experience prejudice. This is similar to racism and the two words are often used as if they are interchangeable.\n“It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. But they are not all their lives subject to racism.\n“In pre-civil rights America, Irish people, Jewish people and Travellers were not required to sit at the back of the bus. In apartheid South Africa, these groups were allowed to vote. And at the height of slavery, there were no white-seeming people manacled on slave ships.”\nMs Abbott said in her apology: “I am writing regarding my letter that was recently published in the Observer. I wish to wholly and unreservedly withdraw my remarks and disassociate myself from them.\n“The errors arose in an initial draft being sent. But there is no excuse, and I wish to apologise for any anguish caused.\n“Racism takes many forms, and it is completely undeniable that Jewish people have suffered its monstrous effects, as have Irish people, Travellers and many others. Once again I would like to apologise publicly for the remarks and any distress caused as a result of them.”\n“I want to place on record my solidarity with Diane Abbott,” Ms Webbe tweeted. “She has retracted and disassociated.\n“Now the pile on against her must stop. We must oppose all forms of racism, always.”\nA Labour Party spokesman told the BBC: “The Labour Party completely condemns these comments, which are deeply offensive and wrong. The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Diane Abbott pending an investigation.”\nThe party declined to comment on when an investigation would begin, or who would lead it.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_india-is-literally-fighting-for-breath/content_238.html": "India is literally fighting for breath\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nIt’s time we ended this pandemic for everyone – rich and poor alike says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nWHILE we in Britain can be thankful that, due to the exceptional work of our NHS, Covid-19 cases are relatively low and lockdown measures are relaxing, around the world the pandemic is at an all-time peak.\nPerhaps most concerning is India, which is suffering an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases, with over 300,000 new infections recorded each day.\nIn February 2021 the average number of new cases in India was 11,000, rising to an average of 22,000 new cases until this recent sharp rise.\nHospitals are being overrun, while oxygen and other life-saving medical equipment is in short supply.\nThe scenes of people dying outside hospitals have been absolutely harrowing.\nOn Wednesday, India surpassed 200,000 deaths from the virus, although the actual count is believed to be much higher.\nAs my constituency of Leicester East has one of the largest Indian communities in the country, this has been especially distressing for many whose loved ones are affected by this disaster.\nThere is also deep concern for Indian nationals stranded in Leicester and around Britain, and particularly those who make up the Indian overseas student community.\nA senior Indian health official described the international support received so far as “a drop in the ocean.”\nI have urged the British government to increase the number of surplus therapeutic drugs, oxygen and vaccines to India.\nI also encouraged the government to share British expertise in areas like genome sequencing and epidemiology to map and track the spread of the virus — and to play a leading diplomatic role in helping to co-ordinate the international response to this crisis.\nWhat makes the crisis in India even more alarming is that India was amongst the first countries to call — back in October 2020 — for intellectual property rights to be suspended to ensure that all nations, not only the richest, can produce vaccines at a much cheaper and quicker rate.\nThe landmark proposal, which was jointly submitted by India and South Africa, has been backed by more than 100 mostly developing countries.\nThe waiver, if adopted at the WTO’s general council, could help countries around the world overcome legal barriers preventing them from producing their own coronavirus vaccines and treatments.\nWhile this is not a silver bullet, removing barriers toward the development, production and approval of vaccines is vital in the fight to prevent, treat and contain the coronavirus.\nYet six months on, the life-saving proposition continues to be stonewalled by a small number of wealthy governments — including the US, EU, Britain, Switzerland, Japan, Norway, Canada, Australia and Brazil.\nThis is at the same time as the unprecedented disaster in India, and while coronavirus cases worldwide are at an all-time peak.\nThe World Health Organisation has also repeatedly admonished a “shocking imbalance” in the distribution of vaccines amid the pandemic.\nTo date, an average of one in four people in high-income nations has received a vaccine, compared with one in over 500 for people in low-income countries.\nAt the current rate, the bulk of the adult population in advanced economies is expected to have been vaccinated against the virus by the middle of 2022, whereas the timeline for poorer economies is likely to stretch to 2024 — if it happens at all.\nBy refusing to back this call, the British government has prioritised the profits of pharmaceutical giants over the safety and wellbeing of the Indian people.\nThe government must abandon this vaccine nationalism and commit to support intellectual property waivers, technology transfers and property rights waivers to radically reduce the cost of global vaccine production.\nFailure to do so is not only morally abhorrent but is counter-productive and short-sighted.\nThe People’s Vaccine Alliance, a coalition of over 50 organisations including African Alliance, Oxfam and UNAIDS, recently found that two-thirds of epidemiologists surveyed at some of the world’s leading academic institutions warned that Covid mutations could render current vaccines ineffective in a year or less.\nThe overwhelming majority — 88 per cent — of surveyed epidemiologists said that persistent low vaccine coverage in many countries would make it more likely for vaccine-resistant mutations to appear.\nThe People’s Vaccine Alliance also warned that at the current rate it was likely that only 10 per cent of people in the majority of poor countries will be vaccinated in the next year.\nThe idea that we are isolated from the crisis in India is foolhardy and hubristic in the extreme.\nWhile borders, people and institutions discriminate, the virus does not. The only way for the vaccine to be truly effective is to ensure that everyone around the world is protected from this virus.\nIt is concerning that fewer than 10 per cent of India’s population has received even one dose of the vaccine, despite India being the home of two world-leading manufacturers – the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech produce some of the most expensive vaccines in the world, yet it is India’s population that has been left short.\nIndia’s famous pharmaceutical companies have contributed to the nearly 900 million doses administered globally, but more than 80 per cent of this has gone to wealthy and “upper-middle-income” countries. Poorer countries have received just 0.3 per cent.\nCountries like the UK are vaccinating at a rate of one person per second yet are blocking the waiver of patents that could enable the production of vaccines for developing countries who are struggling to administer a single dose.\nThe British government will argue and mitigate that it contributes to the World Health Organisation’s Covax scheme.\nYet, while this has raised more than $6 billion (£4.3bn), the scheme says it needs at least another $2bn to meet its target for 2021 and $27bn overall to vaccinate poorer nations.\nBritain’s contribution is insufficient, and its approach of vaccine nationalism undermines the work of Covax.\nThe government of India cannot be entirely divorced from blame — ultra-nationalism and far-right politics have failed the people of India.\nThe abrupt lifting of lockdown in May 2020 with the message that India had to “learn to live with the virus” reflects the government’s priority to get the nation “back to business.”\nThe lack of preparation and the consequences of turning over healthcare to the private sector and underfunding public health have laid bare the Indian government’s disastrous policies.\nLow health spending means low expenditure on medical infrastructure and low wages for medical workers.\nThe government’s own data reveals that India has effectively been exporting its oxygen, while depleting its domestic reserves; between April 2020 and January 2021, India exported over 9,000 metric tonnes of oxygen. According to its Ministry of Commerce report, this is more than double the previous year.\nIndia’s scarce oxygen supplies are now going to the highest bidder and with India’s richest 1 per cent holding 73 per cent of its wealth, it is becoming clearer that the rich are breathing, the poor are not.\nWith the tragedy in India, it’s time we ended this pandemic for everyone, rich and poor alike.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_allowing-asylum-seekers-to-work-makes-sense/content_641.html": "Allowing asylum-seekers to work make sense\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nGranting all migrants indefinite leave to remain and the ability to work will only strengthen the power of our class – as well as boosting the economy\nWe can learn a lot from those who experience and resist the British asylum system.\nUnder current rules, asylum-seekers are not permitted to work except in very rare “exceptional” circumstances. Neither are they allowed to claim normal welfare benefits, forcing them to rely on a tiny amount of state support.\nThat support is meagre at best: under £41 a week per person — less than £6 a day for essentials, let alone for activities where they and their children can make friends and integrate into communities.\nMothers with children under three get just an extra £3 a week. For those in asylum accommodation, it’s even worse, with support at just £1.20 a day.\nAccommodation provided by the government for refugees, through the use of private-sector companies, was described by a recent report of the home affairs select committee as a “disgrace.”\nSuch meanness sentences asylum-seekers to near-destitution for as long as it takes the government to decide their case, leading even centre-right group Bright Blue to say that being an asylum-seeker is “strongly associated with impoverishment.”\nAnd of course, we are in the middle of a government-inflicted cost-of-living crisis. Food costs and bills are soaring, and wages and benefits are not keeping up with inflation.\nIn such crises, it’s the most vulnerable in our society who suffer the most — and there are few more vulnerable and more unsupported than asylum-seekers.\nCurrent levels of support for people in the asylum system are far below universal credit and have not kept pace with the cost of living.\nBut even such parsimonious support is used as a political tool by the Tories and their fellow travellers. The government routinely whips up anti-refugee sentiment as a distraction from its failures, or to justify yet further cruelties, with the claim that they represent some kind of unbearable burden on our society and the public purse.\nSupposedly, this rule is in place to differentiate asylum from economic migration and discourage economic migrants from making “inappropriate asylum applications” to work in Britain.\nBut this rationale by the government doesn’t stand up to even basic scrutiny. Why would providing the basic right to work lead to an influx of economic migrants wanting to pose as asylum-seekers? What evidence is this based on? There is none.\nNor is there any evidence that any form of generosity in the asylum system would lead to more refugees trying to come here.\nA Home Office study in 2002, under a Labour government, concluded that there was “very little evidence” that refugees even knew what their entitlements would be, let alone that they understood the relative levels of support available in various countries or that it influenced their decision on where to seek asylum.\nA 2011 study by the OECD found that tightening welfare provisions had no deterrent effect on refugee destinations.\nAs in so many areas, the government is taking decisions against common sense, evidence and decency, for political reasons that are positively cruel.\nImmigration policies have explicitly been developed to create a hostile environment, introduced formally in 2012, and to extend border controls to everyday life activities as per the Immigration Acts of 2014 and 2016, by requiring banks, hospitals, schools and landlords to do immigration checks on anyone trying to access basic services.\nAll are designed to make life without secure immigration status as difficult as possible and to discourage would-be asylum-seekers and irregular migrants from coming to Britain — and to make staying here for those without leave to remain so hostile they will voluntarily leave.\nIn reality, the simplest and most efficient solution in most cases would be to allow asylum-seekers to work. This would both enable them and their families to take some control and agency in their situation and simultaneously reduce the cost to the state — and with many businesses struggling to find workers, it would be an economic benefit to the country.\nPerversely, those realities probably play a key role in the government’s lack of political interest in taking that simple and logical step.\nWhile the moral and economic justifications for it are obvious, allowing asylum-seekers to work would deprive the government of its propaganda that asylum-seekers are a drain on the country and a detriment to our society — and we all know how much the mainstream media loves to fall back on finger-pointing and “othering” of the poor, the vulnerable and especially refugees, to cover for the Tories’ lack of compassion and competence and the fundamentally destructive nature of their politics and ideology.\nAllowing asylum-seekers to work would both allow them to provide for themselves and their families a better standard of living and improve their participation and engagement in society.\nIt is also a socialist imperative. Quite apart from the principles of internationalism and solidarity that underpin our politics, which mean we have far more in common with asylum-seekers than the super-rich, in a society in which the working class is under constant attack by the Establishment, the need to broaden our class and the clarity of our common identity is obvious.\nAnd in cold economic terms, it’s also common sense to allow asylum-seekers to work. Britain needs workers.\nSome might argue that increasing the workforce might depress wages and allow employers to exploit workers for greater profit. But our NHS has over 100,000 vacancies and farms struggle to bring in crops — as of last April there were almost 1.3 million unfilled vacancies in this country.\nAllowing asylum-seekers to work would have no impact on workers’ ability or otherwise to demand fair value for their labour.\nThe government will argue that for those waiting more than 12 months for a decision on their asylum claim, the right to work exists — but this is limited to jobs on the UK Shortage Occupation List.\nAny cursory glance at this list of “highly specialised jobs” will see such jobs as geoscientist, hydrogeologist, skilled classical ballet, skilled orchestral musician, archaeologist and geophysicist.\nEven fishing is limited to deckhands on large fishing vessels (nine metres and above) with at least three years of full-time experience.\nThe reality is many asylum-seekers will not hold the qualifications or experience for such jobs and so the list becomes a de facto barrier to legal employment.\nTony Benn famously said that we should pay attention to how our government treats refugees because it’s how it would treat us if it could get away with it. The current government clearly thinks it can treat all of us with contempt and cruelty, and the fight for humane treatment of asylum-seekers is an area where we can and must fight to reverse the trend.\nIf this country becomes a place where those fleeing wars and persecution can live decently, be treated humanely and be helped to be part of and contribute to our society, then by Benn’s measure it is a step toward Britain becoming a decent place to live for the many.\nTime and again, this government has chosen to turn its back on those seeking protection from war, torture or other awful acts. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain is now officially in recession — this inevitably compounds the misery of people fleeing intolerable conditions.\nWe need to push harder for people seeking asylum to be given the right to work from the outset, as well as for a dramatic increase in the level of support for asylum-seekers and for everyone else who is struggling so that they can live with dignity. We must end this slow violence, inflicted by the state against asylum-seekers.\nIt’s up to all of us to continue to push the government to redesign the asylum system along the principles of solidarity and decency, provide indefinite leave to remain for all undocumented migrants, open up safe and legal routes to claim asylum — and end the destructive demonisation of refugees and asylum-seekers once and for all.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_has-uk-support-for-israel-reached-a-tipping-point/content_244.html": "Has UK support for Israel reach a tipping point?\nAnalysis: British MPs and advocacy groups told the New Arab that the UK must suspend weapons to Israel if it is to abide by domestic and international law.\nSix months have elapsed since Israel launched its brutal military assault on the besieged Gaza Strip.\nDespite the extensive destruction and humanitarian anguish that’s unfolded in Gaza, Israel’s Western backers have still largely resisted calls to end their own complicity.\n“After six months of relentless, indiscriminate bombardment by the Israeli military, there are no more words I can use to adequately describe the horror and suffering being inflicted on Gaza’s civilians,” Aseel Baidoun, Director of Advocacy and Campaigns at Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), told The New Arab.\nThe UK government is currently under immense pressure from many segments of society – ranging from lawyers, MPs, rights groups, and grassroots activists – urging an immediate halt of arms sales to Israel, citing legal and humanitarian violations committed in Gaza.\nThis push has intensified following the killing of seven aid workers from the humanitarian NGO World Central Kitchen on 1 April, three of whom were British nationals, all victims of three separate Israeli strikes.\n“The UK government is currently under immense pressure from many segments of society – ranging from lawyers, MPs, rights groups, and grassroots activists – urging an immediate halt of arms sales to Israel”\nAnd per a leaked recording reported by the Observer, UK government lawyers had warned ministers that Israel has broken international humanitarian law in Gaza, information the government has not made public.\nDespite initially supporting Israel’s “right to self-defence” following Hamas’ 7 October attack, Britain’s continued deference to Israel’s narratives during its subsequent military offensive is becoming less defensible.\n“In a situation where Israel’s actions have crossed every feasible red line, the UK government must take concrete action that ends this horror,” added Aseel.\nComplicity in Israeli violations\nDespite the growing legal backlash, Deputy PM Oliver Dowden claimed on 7 April that “I think that Israel is conducting a legitimate campaign,” adding that Foreign Secretary David Cameron’s advice on continuing but reviewing arms exports “has not changed”.\nSo far, the UK government has refused to investigate how its own arms sales may fuel violations, let alone seriously contemplate an arms embargo.\nAlthough the United States and Germany are Israel’s primary arms suppliers, Britain still provides important components used in Israeli-used warplanes, including the F-35s and F-16s, underscoring the UK’s less visible, albeit significant, contribution to Israel’s military capabilities.\nHowever, these components are among the 62 open license parts not included in the single British arms licenses worth over £487 million since 2015. This omission means the actual value of British exports to Israel currently remains unclear.\nLayla Moran, a British-Palestinian MP whose family were until recently trapped in Gaza, told The New Arab that “the thought that UK-made arms could have been used in strikes, including the one that killed aid workers, is unconscionable”.\nThe Liberal Democrat MP said: “If the UK Government has received legal advice that Israel’s actions are not compliant with international humanitarian law, then Conservative ministers risk being in breach of the Ministerial Code by failing to halt UK arms exports to Israel”.\nEven before the recent aid worker killings, over 200 humanitarian workers had been killed in Gaza, as well as over 136 journalists, on top of a Palestinian death toll of over 33,000, including 13,000 children.\n“Gaza is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be an aid worker right now,” said Aseel Baidoun of MAP. “Our own emergency medical team was hit by an Israeli airstrike on their compound on 18 January.”\n“After months of Israeli attacks on civilians, ministers may be approaching a tipping point, and the looming threat of legal challenges against them and their officials over the lawfulness of the UK’s arms to Israel policy may also be coming into play”\nBaidoun said that their compound was attacked after its coordinates had been shared with the Israeli military through the UN’s deconfliction process, which is meant to protect humanitarian personnel in Gaza.\n“An independent multi-agency investigation by the UN carried out on 19 January found that it had most likely involved a GBU32 (MK83) missile package. This 1000 lb US-manufactured ‘smart bomb’ was fired from an F16 jet. F16s are manufactured in the US and include parts supplied by the UK,” she told TNA.\nThe weaponisation of aid and the record number of aid workers killed in Israel’s war has compounded Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and triggered what EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently described as a man-made famine.\nA boiling point\nWith Israel’s plethora of violations now laid bare, the pressure within the UK has certainly reached a boiling point, with cross-parliamentary opposition.\nIn late March, over 134 MPs parliamentarians signed a letter to David Cameron and Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch calling for an immediate arms embargo, penned by Labour MP Zarah Sultana. Among them were six Conservative MPs and 55 Labour MPs. Both the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party oppose weapons sales and support a ceasefire over Gaza.\nFormer prominent Conservatives have also denounced arms sales, including former foreign minister Alan Duncan and former UK National Security Advisor Peter Ricketts. London Mayor Sadiq Khan also urged a ban on weapons to Israel on 4 April.\nIn the media sector, British newspapers such as the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Daily Telegraph, which had given favourable coverage to Israel, mourned the killings of the three British aid workers while criticising the fact that an Israeli airstrike was responsible.\nEven LBC presenter Nick Ferrari, who had described himself as a “friend” of Israel, suggested Britain should now suspend weapons.\n“It speaks volumes about Western prejudice that media and many politicians in the UK have said more about the killing of seven people, when three British citizens were among the victims, than about the tens of thousands of Palestinians murdered in Gaza and the use of starvation as a weapon of war,” Claudia Webbe, MP for Leicester East, told The New Arab.\n“However, prejudice aside, the UK government’s prime responsibility is supposed to be the protection of its people, yet even after three were violently killed the reaction of David Cameron and the government is limited to yet more regret and finger-wagging.”\nOn a societal level, Israel has increasingly lost favour. A new YouGov poll found, even before the airstrike on the WCK workers, that around 56% of the British public now support a suspension of arms sales to Israel, as opposed to 17%, while the same poll found that 59% think Israel is violating human rights in Gaza.\n“During the past six months, the UK’s arms export control system has completely failed regarding the safety-first principle of suspending arms transfers when there’s a clear risk of their misuse”\nLegal challenges\nOver 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court President Lady Hale, have warned the Prime Minister in a letter that exporting weapons to Israel could breach international law, citing Gaza’s deteriorating conditions and the International Court of Justice’s mention of the risks of genocide as reasons for the UK to cease arms sales.\nCivil servants working on arms exports at the Department of Business and Trade have threatened potential legal action against the government to stop their members from being compelled to support illegal arms transfers.\n“After months of Israeli attacks on civilians, ministers may be approaching a tipping point, and the looming threat of legal challenges against them and their officials over the lawfulness of the UK’s arms to Israel policy may also be coming into play,” Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International UK’s Crisis Response Manager, told The New Arab.\n“During the past six months, the UK’s arms export control system has completely failed regarding the safety-first principle of suspending arms transfers when there’s a clear risk of their misuse.”\nShould Britain eventually be forced into suspending weapons to Israel, such a move wouldn’t be unprecedented.\nIn 1982, Margaret Thatcher imposed an arms embargo on Israel over the 1982 Lebanon war, which wasn’t lifted until 1994. Moreover, Labour Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown suspended lethal equipment to Israel during the Second Intifada and the 2008-09 Gaza war respectively.\nYet the current Conservative government, which has established an unprecedently close relationship with the Israeli right wing, has remained determined not to suspend arms, despite publicly expressing concern for Gaza’s humanitarian catastrophe.\n“Gradually the UK is moving from being mildly critical of Israel’s actions on the humanitarian front to taking a more robust position generally,” Chris Doyle, Director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, told TNA. “For Palestinians, much of this is far too late.”\nPublishing the government lawyers’ legal advice could likely compel Britain into implementing an arms embargo. And doing so may also establish a precedent, encouraging other European countries to halt their weapons sales as well.\nWhile domestic legal pressures are expected to play a significant role in changing the government’s stance, international developments could further drive this shift.\nNot only has the ICJ already spotlighted the role of Israel’s supporters, on 5 April, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted in favour of a resolution that calls for a ban on arms sales to Israel. External legal and political pressure may also compel the government to act.\nHowever, there are also concerns that an arms embargo, even if implemented, may only be temporary and, ultimately, insufficient in ending the suffering of the Palestinians.\n“If the UK wants to comply properly with international law, it also needs to introduce emergency measures to recognise the state of Palestine and to call for all Western nations to fund the rebuilding of its flattened homes, schools and hospitals,” said Claudia Webbe, adding that sanctions on Israel and Israeli politicians would also ultimately help stop the atrocities in Gaza.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_too-poor-to-stay-safe/content_868.html": "Too poor to stay safe\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nBefore this lockdown is relaxed, the government must ensure that everyone has the means to isolate, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE coronavirus pandemic has been exceptionally difficult for everyone living in Britain, and nowhere more so than the city of Leicester, which has borne the brunt of the government’s incompetence.\nLeicester has been under the harshest lockdown or enhanced restrictions longer than any other area in the UK — the city had more Covid-19 deaths than any other part of England and Wales in July 2020.\nAccording to the most up-to-date ONS statistics, my constituency of Leicester East has, tragically, suffered 155 deaths, although the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher as the ONS has only published data up to December 2020.\nThis week saw salt poured into the wounds of Leicester residents with the report by the government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). The report, produced in January 2021, focused on three coronavirus “hotspots,” including my home town of Leicester.\nIt concluded that “unmet financial needs” meant people in poorer areas were less likely to be able to self-isolate because they could not afford to lose income.\nIt identified a “perfect storm” of low wages, cramped housing and failures of the £22 billion test-and-trace scheme that has led to “stubbornly high” coronavirus rates.\nThe report provides an insight into how the government has left behind areas like Leicester.\nThe number of unemployed people in Leicester East has more than doubled since the start of lockdown and foodbanks in the city have reported huge rises in people seeking help to feed themselves and their families.\nPeople who are less well-off find it very hard to take days off work when they know they won’t be paid or, worse, will lose their job.\nLeicester’s spike in cases was linked to the fact that low-paid workers on informal or zero-hours contracts and those with an undocumented immigration status or no recourse to public funds were unable to safely isolate or take time away from exploitative and dangerous workplaces.\nThe JBC report is highly critical of the lack of financial support for those who have to isolate. The government should have made it simple: if you get contacted by test and trace, you must be provided with the material means to isolate.\nIt is estimated that at least 20,000 people a day are not complying fully with isolation orders, allowing the virus to spread. This is not due to moral failures on behalf of the public — but because it is impossible for people reduced to poverty to comply with guidance on self-isolation and social distancing.\nIt is not just morally imperative but in the best public-health interest of everyone in our country that people’s basic needs are met. Yet the government failed to ensure this for working-class people in Leicester and across Britain. It was happy to squander billions to enrich private companies but flinched at ensuring that people were not faced with a choice between destitution or infection.\nThe JBC report was critical of the government’s test-and-trace system, which has cost more than five times the amount so far spent on vaccines, arguing that contact-tracing data had not been given to local authorities quickly enough to contain outbreaks.\nLeicester is a prime example of the success of the local public-health-led tracing systems compared with the costly private system.\nDue to the hard work of local authority workers, as well as their access to local data and contact details, the success rate of Leicester’s contact system was 85 per cent — whereas the private system languished at around 55 per cent.\nYet when myself and others requested that this effective model be granted more responsibility, the national Contact Tracing and Advisory Service rejected this plea.\nThis reflects the government’s ideological commitment to the private sector, as the government has instead given billions to companies to oversee the disastrous track-and-trace system in shady deals that have been accused of cronyism and corruption.\nThe JBC report also said that “existing socio-economic inequality” had left African, Asian and minority ethnic communities at greater exposure to Covid-19 as they were more likely to live in cramped and multigenerational housing in deprived areas and hold public-facing jobs.\nThe ONS found that overcrowding is a growing problem in Leicester, and Leicester East in particular.\nThere are pockets of areas close to Leicester’s general hospital with populations of 2,000 living in an area the size of 60,000 square metres in size. Each person has an average of 32 square metres of space, the equivalent to a box bedroom.\nThe UK average is 3,676 square metres of space, which is over 100 times the amount of space of people living in Leicester East.\nI am incredibly proud of the multiculturalism and diversity of my home city. Yet this means that Leicester is more deeply affected by the disproportionate impact of the virus.\nExisting racial and class inequalities, coupled with inadequate government support, mean that working-class people, migrants and African, Asian and minority ethnic communities are at greater risk and exposure to Covid-19.\nDespite this clear risk, the report highlighted that “guidance around how to self-isolate safely in high-density housing does not appear to exist for England as it does for Scotland and Northern Ireland.”\nThis is an appalling dereliction of duty from this government of the super-rich.\nThe report also found evidence that areas with a higher proportion of workers in public-facing roles, such as health and social care, taxi drivers or supermarket workers, were likely to experience high infection rates.\nTaxi drivers in Leicester are the beating heart of our community, yet too many — especially those working for gig-economy giants like Uber — have been forced to work with no sick pay and very little protections.\nWe should all welcome the recent landmark supreme court victory that declared Uber drivers as workers with access to the minimum wage and paid holidays.\nWe on the left must keep up the momentum and force the government to crack down on toxic casualisation so that each worker gets guaranteed pay for a working week.\nI have been campaigning to end the scandal of exploitation in significant parts of Leicester’s garment industry — which despite being widely reported and studied for at least a decade, successive governments have failed to address.\nThe recurring issues are disgraceful. Garment factories have remained open throughout the pandemic, they routinely under-report hours, and the threat of redundancy is often used as leverage to stop workers from whistleblowing.\nFactory overcrowding is also commonplace, and with a lack of personal, protective equipment, this has undoubtedly contributed to the high levels of Covid-19 in our city.\nThere are also a significant number of migrant workers who are either undocumented or have no recourse to public funds.\nThey are predominantly women, who are often particularly vulnerable for wage exploitation and at risk of contracting the virus. Indeed, recent ONS figures found that women working in Britain’s garment factories are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than the average woman worker, with sewing machinists having the highest death rate (64.8 per 100,000) of any female occupation.\nThese appalling statistics demonstrate that it is not only a moral and ethical imperative for the crisis of exploitation to be addressed but a major public-health issue too.\nBillionaires exist when and where employees are exploited. We cannot allow companies to continue getting away with this predatory business model, in which corporate profits are prioritised above human rights and wellbeing.\nI have written to the government with policy suggestions to address this crisis.\nIt must finally act to end the scourge of exploitation in Leicester, across Britain and around the world.\nBefore this lockdown is relaxed, the government must ensure that everyone has the means to isolate.\nStatutory sick pay must be increased to a living-wage level and made available to all workers.\nFurlough must be extended and fixed so that no-one receives less than the minimum wage, and public-services wages must be increased.\nThe notion of cutting universal credit, must be abandoned — and instead it must be increased further.\nThe mortgage holiday, eviction ban and support to renters must be strengthened. And the disastrous, costly reliance on the private sector must be abandoned.\nThe disproportionate suffering during the pandemic on areas like Leicester is a damning indictment of the government’s failure to prioritise public health and implement a zero-Covid strategy to suppress the virus.\nWe on the left must continue to fight for a society which is built around people’s needs, health and wellbeing.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_who-will-compensate-and-protect-workers-in-leicesters-garment-industry/content_331.html": "Who will compensate and protect workers in Leicester’s garment industry?\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nDespite the extended media focus, as the year draws to a close, the central questions remain unanswered when it comes to vulnerable and exploited workers, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE\nTHIS year has been exceptionally difficult for us all. My city of Leicester has had it particularly tough for two key reasons.\nWe have faced coronavirus restrictions for longer than any other area, which includes not been able to visit each other’s home indoors since the start of the first national lockdown in March 2020 and we have also faced an overdue yet painful resurgence of attention on the scandal in our garment industry.\nExploitation in Leicester’s garment industry has been an “open secret” and widely reported and studied for at least a decade, yet successive conservative governments have failed to act.\nDespite the extended media focus, as the year draws to a close, the central questions remain unanswered — what progress has been made this year, and who is protecting workers in Leicester’s garment industry?\nTomorrow, the environmental audit committee — of which I am a member — shall be examining Leicester’s garment industry as part of our follow-up inquiry on fashion sustainability.\nShamefully, the government rejected most if not all the recommendations of the committee’s 2019 inquiry entitled Fixing Fashion: Clothing Consumption and Sustainability, which highlighted concerns regarding fast fashion and exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry.\nAfter this year’s resurgence of reports and widespread condemnation into the scandal, the government must take its head out of the sand and legislate to protect vulnerable workers.\nThe investigation will include an evidence session with Boohoo Group’s executive chairman, Mahmud Kaman.\nThe recent Levitt inquiry, commissioned by Boohoo itself, found that Boohoo was aware of endemic workers’ rights abuses in Leicester’s garment industry.\nBy procuring garments from companies that routinely under-report hours, force employees to work in buildings that pose a severe fire risk and pay as little as four times lower than the legal minimum wage — BooHoo has been complicit in severe instances of exploitation.\nYet it chose to ignore the plight of workers in order to seek ever-higher profits, as sales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have also helped reward BooHoo’s bosses with bonuses worth £150 million.\nYet despite being at the centre of this scandal, it is unclear what action BooHoo has taken to end exploitation in their supply chains.\nFor example, it is not clear what steps Boohoo has taken to ensure that its purchasing practices don’t act as a driver for illegal pay and poor conditions.\nBoohoo must sign the transparency pledge and make all of its supplier details public (at home and abroad).\nIndeed, it is appalling that Boohoo has not yet published a full list of its suppliers — despite promising to do so.\nThis only begs the question, what is it attempting to hide?\nAs the excellent campaign group Labour Behind the Label argue, Boohoo must also end its behaviour of terminating ties with suppliers without paying back wages.\nGoing further than this, Boohoo should make funding immediately available to ensure that all workers who have enabled their huge profits are fully compensated for years of working at less than half the minimum wage.\nBeyond Boohoo, the government and regulatory institutions are not doing nearly enough to protect and recompense underpaid workers.\nWorkers are still not being paid at least the minimum wage and remain for years on zero-hours contracts without access to holiday pay, sick pay, meal breaks or time-off pay.\nThere are still grave concerns regarding the illegal use of furlough, double record keeping and unsafe and dangerous work environments.\nResearch carried out by the University of Leicester in 2015 revealed that most garment workers were paid way below the national minimum wage, did not have employment contracts, and were subject to intense and arbitrary work practices.\nThe research calculated that the average wage was approximately £3 per hour and made a conservative estimate that the underpaid wage sum in apparel manufacturing within the East Midlands was around £1 million per week.\nA more recent study by the British Retail Consortium puts the figure at nearer 2.1 million per week.\nThe workers whose wages have been stolen from them must be recompensed.\nSerious questions need to be asked about the extent to which some among Leicester textile suppliers have engaged in money laundering and VAT fraud.\nA recent BBC investigation found that firms in Leicester which supplied Boohoo and Select Fashion had engaged in fraudulent practices, including misleading invoices and cash laundering transactions.\nThis investigation found that £8m had been received by six companies said to be issuing fake invoices to the original wholesaler, which means that as much as £1.6m of VAT was not recovered.\nAs this investigation was only the tip of the iceberg, it is possible that tens or even hundreds of millions of taxes are being avoided across the sector.\nOne of the main reasons why these appalling instances of workplace exploitation in Leicester have been able to exist unchecked, is that 10 years of austerity has severely downgraded our regulatory institutions.\nThe local authority in Leicester has had its central government grant funding cut from £289m in 2010 to £171m in 2019.\nThe government has also slashed the budget of the Health and Safety Executive by £100m, or 46 per cent, since 2010.\nThe budget of HM Revenue and Customs, the body which is meant to enforce the minimum wage, was 40 per cent less in 2016 than in 2000, and staffing levels were reduced by approximately 50 per cent over the same period.\nIn 2020, HMRC’s national minimum wage team remains significantly under-resourced, meaning the risk of inspection is low.\nThe most recent director of labour market strategy states that “the average employer can expect an inspection around once every 500 years.”\nThere are also grave concerns regarding the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), which is dubbed by the government as the leading investigative agency for labour exploitation in Britain.\nFor one thing, between July and August 2020 — the peak of coverage of this crisis — GLAA did not carry out any enforcement action against employers.\nYet equally worrying is the fact that investigations carried out previously by GLAA involved joint work with immigration enforcement.\nFor instance, in 2011, Operation Serbal was launched by the UK Border Agency and so called “illegal workers” were arrested in a series of raids on Leicester clothing factories, between May and July 2011.\nIndeed, this summer saw a noticeable increase in immigration enforcement vans following the recent resurgence in media reports on this scandal.\nThis is as counterproductive as it is callous. As the Trades Union Congress rightly highlights, there is clear evidence that workers are deterred from making complaints as they fear being wrongly referred to immigration enforcement.\nJoint working should cease and a firewall between immigration enforcement and employment rights enforcement agencies should be established.\nThere must be a switch in focus from immigration status to tackling worker exploitation.\nRights are meaningless if they are not properly enforced. The government must urgently reverse the funding cuts to regulatory bodies to ensure the safety and fair pay of those at work.\nThe government could also enhance current regulations by introducing a textile adjudicator (similar to the Groceries Code Adjudicator), which could ensure that payment terms to suppliers are fair, including offering recourse to solution on late order cancellations, delays in payments, unfair or illegal deductions, all of which have a knock-on effect on employment at supplier factories and the ability of suppliers to pay legal wages and provide secure employment.\nTrade unions are the best line of defence against workplace exploitation, and the government must open the door for their involvement.\nUnions must be granted access to Leicester workplaces to inform workers about the benefits of union membership and collective bargaining.\nIt also must be made easier for working people to negotiate collectively with their employer, including simplifying the process that workers must follow to have their union recognised by their employer for collective bargaining.\nThe scope of collective bargaining rights must also be widened, and trade unions should be actively involved in labour market inspections.\nPerhaps a new textile and garment workers union is long overdue to help restore Leicester’s once proud role as the jewel in the crown of British industry.\nOverall, the lack of progress, made this year, in tackling exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry, mirrors that of the last decade — which is simply not good enough.\nPrivate companies like Boohoo, regulatory bodies and — ultimately — the government must start approaching this crisis with the ambition and urgency it demands.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_climate-breakdown-is-playing-out-along-colonial-lines-we-need-to-remake-the-world-system/content_619.html": "Climate breakdown is playing out along colonial lines: we need to remake the world system\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe global North is responsible for 92 per cent of excess carbon dioxide emissions and subsidises its fossil fuel industries by trillions — yet it is the post-colonial world which suffers most, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST week I gave the opening speech at the Bandung Africa conference on climate change and conservation, which was held in Kenya. It was held in the spirit of the first Bandung conference in 1955, which brought together many newly liberated African and Asian nations determined to oppose and overturn colonialism.\nNo examination of climate change and environmental justice in Africa can separate either the current situation or the routes to progress from the impacts of colonialism and imperialism.\nThose impacts have both formed the current landscape and continue to impede the steps Africans — at home and abroad — can take to redress injustices and achieve and demand better going forward.\nThis continuing impact means that if Africa is to make the progress it needs to make, it must decolonise its economy and ecosystems. The development of the Western economic system today and its legacy of racism, inequality and climate disaster is a direct result of neoliberal capitalism, colonialism and imperialism. Climate breakdown is playing out along colonial lines.\nColonial attitudes permeate the programmes of continued theft and violent extraction of African mineral wealth, inflicting great damage on the lives of individuals, communities, environments and the prospect of political stability. Vast areas of Africa are becoming uninhabitable as corporations strip and degrade the continent’s natural wealth of forests, land, water and ecosystems.\nThese fossil fuel companies and corporations, aided and abetted by rich countries in the global North, are making trillions in profit every year from the extraction and sale of fossil fuels that are driving global warming. Since 2015, G20 nations have spent £2.9 trillion subsidising fossil fuel industries.\nIt is no accident that conditions like war and large-scale conflict, climate disasters, environmental pollution and malnutrition are concentrated in the global South. Shamelessly, rich countries of the global North have significantly increased their spending every year to keep out the climate refugees they created.\nA study by an international team of climate scientists has found that the recent devastating flooding that struck Nigeria, Niger and Chad, among the deadliest on record there, was made about 80 times more likely by the climate crisis. Hundreds were killed, 1.5 million were displaced and more than 500,000 hectares of farmland were damaged.\nResearch by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation shows that if urgent action is not taken to address climate change, 40 million more people in Africa are set to be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 and more than 85 million people could be physically displaced by the middle of this century — more than in any other region of the world.\nBut things are moving in the wrong direction and the pace never slows. As Greenpeace noted recently, across the continent massive extraction programmes are going ahead despite allegations of violated laws and encroachment on communities’ land and untouched forest, including oil drilling that will devastate some of Africa’s most pristine ecosystems, vital for wildlife migratory routes, carbon absorption and tourism income.\nExtraction-based economics brings few real gains to most African nations and their people and turns the continent’s vast mineral wealth into a “resource curse” that turns greedy eyes (the eye of avarice) toward the continent, driving pollution and the destruction of Africa’s unique habitats.\nAnd it’s not just extractionism perpetuating the harms of colonialism. That same colonial mindset shapes national and international environmental policies as well — baking the disadvantages that have been inflicted on Africa across centuries of exploitation into international law and allowing the needs of developed countries to override those of developing and least-developed countries.\nRich nations transfer environmental hazards to developing nations in the form of dangerous industries generating toxic by-products and in the direct shipping of poisonous waste and materials, fuelling criminal networks that receive it and illegally dump it despite the Bamako Convention.\nThose same nations and international penholders have also failed to implement laws to prevent the wealthy from Europe and the US from fuelling the abhorrent trophy-hunting industry, which has had a devastating effect on wildlife in Africa and which has taken hold in places like Kenya.\nAnd over all this, Western environmental and economic goals define international aims, promoting Western interests and exacerbating environmental injustice everywhere else.\nThese aims take little notice and less account of environmental exploitation and racism, or the needs of developing nations to build their economic health and security.\nMore than 600 million people in Africa still lack access to electricity. Global climate discussions must acknowledge African people’s right to energy and that this inequality cannot continue — but international agreements and discourse often work against this, ignoring Africa’s needs and the fact that the continent could be making huge contributions to the low-carbon future we need instead of simply being stripped of resources in a way that fuels the climate crisis.\nThe global climate agenda in its current form is failing the people of Africa, paying little heed to the need for financial help to adapt and their entitlement to compensation for the loss and damage that has been inflicted on them by the global North-induced climate crisis.\nAt Cop27 the message from global South countries was clear: we need a remake of the world system. The global North is responsible for 92 per cent of all excess global carbon dioxide emissions, but it’s the global South which suffers most from climate breakdown and the devastation of famine, droughts, floods, storms and sea level rises, coupled with reduced economic growth, loss of life and livelihoods and biodiversity loss.\nThis is a straightforward case for reparations, including debt cancellation. The climate crisis arises from the same political history as racial injustice and presents a challenge of the same scale, extent and scope.\nWe need a global climate tax so that the global rich pay for the ecological damage they have been causing since the industrial revolution. We can no longer accept a society predicated on climate apartheid, where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict whilst the rest of the world is left to suffer.\nIf the international community keeps ignoring Africa’s needs, it will sentence almost 1.5 billion people to perpetual economic underdevelopment and political volatility.\nThe damage done by centuries of colonialism is too great for anything but radical action to even begin to put things right.\nClimate activists, conservationists and grassroots movements must continue to receive our full and unconditional support.\nAs with any change for the better, those in power will not willingly give any part of it up for the sake of others. Yet the climate breakdown we are experiencing demands nothing less. We need systems organised around human wellbeing, climate justice and ecology rather than the interests of corporate profits and the accumulation of wealth for the elite.\nOur systems of production should be based on human need, not greed. Ultimately, we need to dismantle neoliberalism and democratise our economies. As the Bandung Africa conference demonstrated over the course of two days, we can no longer be hostages to the rich or their hold on capital. To protect people and planet, we all have work to do.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-left-must-resist-calls-for-shock-therapy-austerity-before-its-too-late/content_376.html": "The left must resist calls for ‘shock therapy’ austerity – before it’s too late\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe have to fight for a new social settlement after this crisis, writes Claudia Webbe MP\nDuring this coronavirus crisis we have experienced our dependence on each other. And we’ve seen how – as Boris Johnson himself has now admitted – Margaret Thatcher was wrong when she claimed there was no such thing as society.\nWe have also seen how much we all depend upon those who have been undervalued for far too long.\nThis was confirmed by research published by the IFS (Institute for Fiscal Studies) in late April showing those termed as key workers are paid hourly wages on average 8% lower than other employees.\nOur key workers who are keeping the country going, keeping us fed and keeping us safe deserve better. As Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Employment Rights and Protections Andy McDonald put it: “Cleaners, carers, and refuse collectors are just a few of those we rely on for the most essential things that keep our society running, and who are now routinely putting their lives on the line to get us through this crisis.”\nNo going back\nWe need government to redress the great debt that we owe to these and other undervalued workers in the economy – both in the private and public sectors – by boosting their wages, conditions and their rights.\nThis is just one aspect where there should be no return to ‘business as usual’ or austerity, as leading economists warned this week. After the amazing efforts and sacrifices we are seeing across every community and locality in Britain – and the drastic measures that have been taken in so many areas of our economy and society – people will rightly not accept a return to the growing insecurity that marked the last decade in particular.\nA return to ‘business as usual’ when it comes to how our economy is restructured – let alone a further dose of severe austerity – would be deeply damaging for both our economy and society.\nWe can no longer tolerate the inequality and insecurity that has left all of our society, public services and households less resilient than we should have been when facing this crisis.\nThe last ten years of ideologically-driven austerity has meant our NHS and other essential public services have been starved of vital resources. This has been accompanied by a steadfast refusal from the Tory government to treat our vital public servants decently when it comes to their pay and conditions.\nWe have seen a normalisation of high levels of poverty and inequality, a homelessness crisis on our streets and, as of last year, the longest wage squeeze in recorded history leading to a growing cost-of-living crisis.\nThe current crisis – with its severe economic impacts – has exposed and will be deepening many of these problems.\nPoverty before the pandemic\nTo give one clear example, the recent figures on low income households published by the government highlighted that even before the current crisis, there was a sharp rise in the number of people in poverty, including an increase in-work poverty.\nSpecifically, these figures for Households Below Average Income, showed that the number of people in relative low income after housing costs (AHC) rose by 500,000 and absolute low income AHC by 400,000.\nWhile the government propaganda machine has regularly claimed that part of the austerity years has been a focus on making work pay, this simply isn’t the case. Instead, after the four-year freeze of working-age benefits and escalation of insecure working, poverty has increased and food bank use has soared.\nIn their totality, poverty data in March showed a record high of 14.5 million people in poverty.\nWith the flood of new Universal Credit claims and other developments during this crisis, it is likely that when these figures are published in the future they will show a picture of even more people pushed into poverty and left at risk of destitution.\nAs millions of workers are furloughed on 80 per cent of their usual wage, or being forced to claim Universal Credit with a five-week delay in payments, we need to act to immediately ensure people have the support they need to make ends meet. There should be a boost to Universal Credit to at least £260 a week and the five-week wait for support should be scrapped.\nRecent weeks have also seen the TUC repeatedly warn that we could be on the brink of another economic crisis and millions of people’s livelihoods are at risk.\nUnemployment had already increased by 22,000 to 1.36 million in the three months to February, even before Covid-19 ‘lockdown’ measures were put in place.\nThese very real dangers our economy faces mean that the labour movement must demand both further action to limit the slide into an economic recession now. But we must also see a commitment to building a different and more equal economy in the years ahead.\nCalls are emerging for ‘shock therapy’ hard-line austerity to ‘reset’ the economy after this crisis. We must firmly resist them.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_rejecting-war-is-not-enough-racism-curdles-peace/content_621.html": "Rejecting War is Not Enough – Racism Curdles Peace\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWar and racism have always been violently, tragically inseparable. For centuries, the most devastating and brutal conflicts in the world have been driven by destructive notions of racial superiority and murderous assertions of ethnic differences.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is abhorrent and deeply concerning. It is an unprovoked, unjustifiable outrage and a heinous violation of international law that will have long-lasting and tragic consequences. The Russian aggression, military bombardment, and deployment of troops to Ukraine should end immediately.\nNo good can ever come from war and military escalation. As Globetrotter journalist Vijay Prashad said at the People’s Forum in February 2022, “War is never good for the poor. War is never good for workers. War itself is a crime.” The international community needs to redouble its efforts to find a diplomatic solution that ensures peace and protects the lives of people in Ukraine and in other countries afflicted by war.\nRacism and Wars\nThe ubiquity of support for Ukraine, especially by Western states, holds up a mirror to show how, through the prism of racism, some conflicts, wars, and incidences of mass suffering are seen as more important and deserving of sympathy than others. There have been numerous instances of journalists expressing shock that the appalling images of suffering from Ukraine are taking place in a European country with a majority white population. This was expressed by NBC News London correspondent Kelly Cobiella, who said: “To put it bluntly, these are not refugees from Syria; these are refugees from neighboring Ukraine… These are Christians; they’re white. They’re very similar [to us].” Echoing this explicit reference to race, Ukraine’s former Deputy Chief Prosecutor David Sakvarelidze told the BBC: “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed.”\nIf we contrast this to the dehumanizing language used to describe nonwhite refugees, asylum-seekers, and victims of war—such as former British Prime Minister David Cameron’s description of refugees as a “swarm”—a very worrying picture emerges about the inherent racism in how crises are reported, discussed, and responded to by the media, leaders, and the public across the world. This othering of nonwhite, non-European people serves to diminish their suffering. We should oppose the unjustifiable trauma of people in Ukraine as vehemently as we do the suffering of victims of conflicts in Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries suffering from the evils of war.\nThe media organizations and the UK government need to recognize that every theater of conflict is deserving of both our solidarity and our compassion. The UK government should therefore provide safe passage and refuge for displaced people, refugees, and asylum-seekers arriving from Ukraine as well as all other theaters of conflict across the globe. The UK government’s ongoing hypocrisy is clear to see with the abhorrent Rwanda offshore processing plan and the anti-refugee Nationality and Borders Act of 2022, which provides for drastic changes in Britain’s asylum system. These policies should be scrapped immediately.\nA Long Tradition of Nonalignment\nOn March 2, 2022, the United Nations held a vote on a motion condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was supported by 141 of its 193 member states, with just five states—Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and Syria—voting against it. To understand why 35 states, which are overwhelmingly former colonies from the Global South, abstained from voting on the motion, it is vital to consider the long tradition of nonalignment based on which these states are acting.\nThe Bandung Conference of 1955 is rightly considered one of the most important meetings in human history, as it was a hugely inspiring global gathering of formerly colonized people and was a strong assertion of Pan-Africanism and anti-imperialist solidarity. The conference also helped to popularize the Nonaligned Movement, which was an effort to counterbalance the rapid polarization of the world during the Cold War, whereby two major powers formed blocs and embarked on a policy to pull the rest of the world into their orbits. One of these blocs was the pro-Soviet, communist bloc united under the Warsaw Pact, and the other was the pro-American, capitalist group of countries, many of which were members of NATO. Millions of civilians died during the proxy wars between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the second half of the 20th century, and the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation hung like the sword of Damocles over the entire planet.\nNonalignment points us toward a safer, more peaceful future. In 1961, drawing on the principles agreed to at the Bandung Conference of 1955, the Nonaligned Movement was formally established in Belgrade, then part of Yugoslavia. Today, the Nonaligned Movement includes 120 countries, representing nearly two-thirds of the United Nations’ members, which are home to 55 percent of the world’s population. Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana and a leader of the Nonaligned Movement, famously said, “We face neither East nor West; we face forward.”\nWhile the Nonaligned Movement developed during the geopolitics of the Cold War, it was founded and has endured on the recognition that no good can ever come from war and that violent conflicts, colonialism, and racism have always been closely intertwined. For instance, of the 35 countries that abstained from voting on March 2, 17 were African nations that for centuries suffered the violent extraction of colonialism. The abstention was far from a reflection of support for Russia’s invasion. It was an assertion of pacifism made by countries that for centuries have lived under the abominable racist outcomes of colonial warfare.\nAcross the world, instances of appalling murder and violence at the hands of the British state have been erased from our present-day memory of the empire. The time has come for former colonial states to apologize for and take seriously the historical debt that they owe to the countries, communities, and individuals who endured their cruelty. A revitalized Nonaligned Movement, guided by the principles of pacifism, justice, and international cooperation, could help rebalance the scales of global politics away from racist wars and toward a future of peace.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_quarter-of-a-million-dead-calls-for-bolsonaro-to-go-chime-louder/content_370.html": "At the end of last week, Brazil passed two devastating landmarks with regards to the Coronavirus pandemic.\nOn the same day as the official death figures from Covid-19 passed 251,000 (this is the second highest in the world despite many people suggesting this total under-estimates the real figure) the largest country in South America also saw its highest daily toll yet, with 1,582 Brazilians dying.\nSince then it has worsened still,with a new record of 1726 daily lives lost from March 1-2, and Brazil’s public health system is approaching breaking point, with most of the country’s intensive care units close to fully occupied.\nAlongside the British Government and the now thankfully departed Trump in the US, Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has ‘overseen’ a disastrous response to Coronavirus.\nHaving dismissed the pandemic as just “a little flu” last year, figures from across Brazilian society still accuse the increasingly unpopular President of failure on many counts, including a slow vaccination rollout (only 3% have received the jab so far) and an uncoordinated government response in a situation where more contagious new variants of the virus are blazing through parts of the country, including remote indigenous areas.\nThe picture is dire throughout the country, with the infection rate rising in every state, and according to the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, an institution linked to the Ministry of Health, “the occupancy rates of ICU beds for COVID-19 for adults reveal the worst scenario observed” yet.\nThis tragic situation means that hospitals in 17 state capitals are overwhelmed with cases, according to the government research institute Fiocruz.\nMore than 90% of intensive care beds are full in the Amazon cities of Manaus and Porto Velho,” with an epidemiologist in Manaus being quoted last week as saying “we observed a very rapid growth in the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Manaus. In a matter of two weeks, the health system collapsed.”\nShowing a lack of preparation and support, this area was one of the worst effected last year and it has been reported that it currently lacks oxygen and health devices for its patients, as well as PPE and other equipment for medical staff.\nThe human impact of such failures is very real – in January in Manaus over 50 people died due to the lack of oxygen and intensive care unit (ICU) beds.\nYet just as the country faces another catastrophic rise in the deadly virus, incredibly Bolsonaro decided now was the time to again discourage the use of masks and encourage more ‘opening up.’ Such a response typifies that of the far and hard-right across the globe, always putting the short-term interests of few to make profit ahead of the needs of people and their health, and indeed the long-term interests of the economy,\nAnd earlier this year, the far-right President astonishingly said “I can’t do anything,” whilst seeking to blame the media and regional governments for the health and economic crises.\nIn light of his disastrous handling of the pandemic, and associated failures in so many other areas of public policy including unemployment rising to 14 million, it is perhaps not surprising that opposition to Bolsonaro is growing.\nA recent weekend for example saw demonstrators in over 70 cities against the far-right President, with people rallying to demand an immediate and free COVID-19 vaccination for the entire population, and calling for Bolsonaro to go.\nProtestors also called for the return of COVID-19 related emergency relief packages which the Government astonishingly recently suspended, when 40 million Brazilians live in extreme poverty.\nAnd as has happened since the start of this crisis, thousands of people across the country bang their pots and pans regularly to call for Bolsonaro to go.\nAdditionally, over 70 impeachment requests have been submitted to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies against Bolsonaro, ranging from issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; police brutality and racism, the destruction of the Amazon and the rocketing of poverty.\nOpposition is not just from left-wing ‘usual suspects’ – a coalition of religious leaders also recently issued a call for his impeachment, backed by 17 Christian movements and 380 bishops, priests, and pastors.\nAccording to a recent poll from Datafolha, Bolsonaro’s popularity is plummeting fast. The amount of Brazilians that considers the president’s administration bad or the worst, increased from 32 percent to 40 percent in just one month, from December 2020 to January 2021.\nAnd the unpopular President can also expect further resistance against further right-wing policies that have recently been announced, including the privatisation of the country’s natural parks, including natural spaces in the Amazon. He has also announced relaxing gun laws to much public dismay.\nInspired by Trump’s recent defeat in the US, the growing resistance in Brazil deserves massive international solidarity – from the need to put people and their health first in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, to the need to protect our environment, to making the slogan of ‘Black Lives Matter’ a reality, their fight is our fight.",
  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-government-errors-that-led-to-leicesters-covid-19-spike-are-clear-to-see/content_362.html": "The government errors that led to Leicester’s Covid-19 spike are clear to see.\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nDelays in passing on vital information, and insufficient financial support for people to self isolate, have proved a deadly combination.\nLike many Leicester residents, I have been extremely concerned by the spike of coronavirus cases in my home city. I understand how difficult it will be for members of our community to see the rest of the country eating in restaurants and going to the cinema. Yet at a time of unprecedented upheaval, it is important that lives and public health are prioritised above all else, and I welcome the extension of lockdown measures.\nLike many of my constituents, I am also concerned that many of the worst affected areas are in Leicester East. (Six out of the seven wards in my constituency were in the top 10 worst affected – with North Evington recording the highest rate.) Like everyone else, I am also concerned about my vulnerable relatives and loved ones who will have to remain shielding.\nYet I wholeheartedly reject those seeking to blame Leicester residents and particular communities for this outbreak. The Public Health England (PHE) preliminary inquiry found that there are a multitude of factors behind Leicester’s increase in coronavirus cases. This reinforces what we already know: that we must not focus the blame inwards towards our varied black and minority ethnic communities.\nLeicester’s diversity is our strength. Yet we know that racial and class inequalities, coupled with inadequate government support, mean that working-class people, migrants and minority ethnic communities are at greater risk both of being exposed to Covid-19, and suffering its worst effects. As Leicester East is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the UK, and has high levels of in-work poverty, we disproportionately suffer from these issues. The virus itself may not discriminate, but our economic and social system certainly does.\nAt every step in this crisis – from lockdown delay, equipment shortages, care home neglect, testing delays, insufficient data and much more – the government has failed to adequately protect our communities.\nSadly, when it comes to localised outbreaks, the government has not learned from its repeated national failures. PHE’s report lays bare the government’s slow and ineffective response to the situation in Leicester. And as the British Medical Association council chair ,Dr Chaand Nagpaul, recently argued, without the long-promised test and trace app and up-to-date local data, future local spikes remain likely.\nThe infection rate recorded in Leicester from pillar 2 testing (tests for the wider population carried out at drive-through centres or through home testing) was more than four times higher than the average for England. Yet this information was not provided to Leicester’s health departments for 11 days – an unacceptable delay that hindered our local response. The government cannot repeat this shocking lack of communication in future outbreaks.\nOf Leicester’s 3,216 cases, almost a third, 944, were diagnosed in the past fortnight. This suggests that the government’s premature relaxing of lockdown and confused messaging may have contributed to the spike in cases. The clarity of “Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives” has been replaced with a confusing blend of gung-ho optimism and public admonitions.\nThe PHE study also found that many of the reported Covid-19 incidents are related to food factories and outlets, and that the average age of those infected is around 40. This suggests that too many working people in Leicester were given inadequate government support to self-isolate – something borne out by recent reports of outbreaks of the virus in garment factories. This reflects my experience, as I have been helping countless local businesses and employees to stay afloat and access funding by navigating the government’s prohibitively strict guidelines.\nWith Leicester required to maintain lockdown measures, it will be necessary for economic support to be extended and expanded. It is crucial that families in Leicester East, and in any future areas which suffer a spike, can afford to stay safe during the continued lockdown.\nEven before the coronavirus hit, the Conservatives had presided over a decade of cuts to essential services while providing tax cuts for the wealthy, during which they allowed poverty and homelessness to rise, and facilitated a transfer of wealth from the poorest to the richest while scapegoating the most vulnerable people. In February, before the coronavirus hit, 14 million people in the UK were living in poverty – including 30% of all our children.\nIt is impossible for impoverished people to comply with guidance on self-isolation and social distancing. It is therefore not just morally imperative, but in the best public health interest of everyone in our country that people’s basic needs are met.\nThe prime minister has recently taken to bizarrely describing the government’s approach to local outbreaks as a “whack-a-mole” strategy. Yet this may be an uncharacteristically honest assessment. Whack-a-mole, an old fairground game, is purely reactive and impossible to successfully plan for.\nAs we go forward, the government must learn the lessons from its mismanagement of Leicester’s spike in coronavirus cases. That means acting now to prevent the further impoverishment of working people and their families. And it means abandoning its cavalier approach for a more strategic, preparation-focused method that prioritises public safety amid any future local outbreaks.",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_there-is-no-such-thing-as-an-illegal-asylum-seeker-but-the-tories-would-have-you-believe-otherwise/content_504.html": "There is no such thing as an illegal asylum-seeker\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Nationality and Borders Bill lacks basic humanity and is anti-refugee to its core, warns CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nBORIS JOHNSON’S government has taken increasingly worrying steps down the plank of authoritarianism in recent months.\nThere is a dangerous reactionary streak running through the Westminster Parliament with such things as the recent Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report and the claim that teaching about white privilege is illegal; the Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) legislation, otherwise known as the “Spycops” Bill, which allows government bodies to authorise law-breaking by undercover operatives in Britain; the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, with its severe crackdown on protest that also criminalises Gypsy and Traveller communities; the plan to make voter ID compulsory to vote in elections despite only six cases of ballot fraud at the last general election and many other initiatives taken by the Conservative government.\nThey all reveal a deeply troubling broader political project, which is designed to chip away at our rights, divide our communities against each other and distract from the real causes of inequality and injustice.\nIn the last week of Parliament before summer recess, the government voted through what is arguably the worst piece of legislation seen in our lifetimes.\nThe Nationality and Borders Bill is anti-refugee to its core. It lacks basic humanity and represents an acceleration in the government’s deeply damaging demonisation of migrants and asylum-seekers.\nFrom its conception the legislation is nothing short of evil, with over 200 human rights groups and civil society groups, including Liberty and Refugee Action, calling its consultation a sham.\nAsylum-seekers will be removed from the UK while their asylum claim or appeal is pending, which opens the door to offshore asylum processing.\nThe Australian model, in which people seeking asylum are processed offshore, has been extensively criticised for failing to meet basic human rights standards.\nIt is the worst refugee framework for our government to try and replicate.\nThe Bill will grant new powers for Border Force to stop and divert vessels suspected of carrying illegal migrants, a policy which is directly pandering to the far-right talking points propagated by the likes of Nigel Farage.\nIt will also enable the British government to block visas for overseas visitors if the home secretary believes their country of origin is refusing to co-operate in taking back “rejected” asylum-seekers or refugees.\nAnalysis of Home Office data by the Refugee Council found that 9,000 people who would be accepted as refugees under current rules — those confirmed to have fled war or persecution — would no longer be given safety in the UK due to their method of arrival under the reforms.\nRefugee Action described the proposals as a “a wrecking ball to the right to claim asylum in the UK.”\nThe proposed rules will produce a two-tier system for those seeking refuge, not based on need but based on a refugee’s route of arrival.\nThis is based on the false premise that an asylum-seeker who has sought to escape persecution and danger through what the government deems to be an “irregular route” to the UK ought not to receive protection.\nThe UK’s already inhumane and stringent asylum process would mean, in practice, that the vast majority fleeing war, famine, persecution, climate disaster or violence will effectively, as a result of this Bill, be blocked at the border.\nThere is no such thing as an illegal asylum-seeker, yet the government is seeking to judge how worthy someone is of asylum by how they arrived in the UK.\nLike many areas of the country, my home city of Leicester is forged from a proud history of welcoming refugees and asylum-seekers, from Jewish communities fleeing the Holocaust to Asian refugees arriving from east Africa in the 1960s. We are richer for this diversity and this exchange of cultures.\nThis draconian Bill betrays Britain’s history of welcoming refugees and asylum-seekers, including the Kindertransport which rescued tens of thousands of children fleeing Nazi barbarism.\nThe UN’s refugee agency and legal experts warn that the Bill risks breaching commitments under the Refugee Convention of 1951.\nThe UK is also bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, which prevents the UK from sending someone to a country where there is a real risk they may be exposed to torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\nThe Nationalities and Borders Bill tramples over this essential human rights obligation.\nThe legislation has rightly been criticised by trade unions, human rights organisations and legal experts including Unison, the UNHCR, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Migrant Voice, Freedom from Torture, The Law Society, Liberty, Detention Action and the British Red Cross.\nThis latest authoritarian step by the British government shows that, far from learning from the appalling treatment of the Windrush generation, the government is intent on expanding the damaging hostile environment.\nThe Runnymede Trust argues that African, African-Caribbean, Asian and minority ethnic communities would disproportionately suffer as a result of this Bill.\nIn reality, the Bill will shut out and disproportionately affect working-class migrants.\nThe Home Office claim that their aim is to prevent criminal trafficking networks.\nYet the Westminster government has persistently been warned that, if it does not open safe and legal routes for people to practice their legal right to claim asylum, then such practices and deaths at sea are unavoidable.\nInstead, it has proceeded to close the few legal avenues that exist, such as the right to family reunion and the Bill does nothing to create safe routes for refugees.\nBritain’s historical and brutal immigration policies, which are echoed to varying degrees across “fortress Europe,” is the reason why 19,000 migrants were reported dead or missing between 2013 and 2019.\nIt is also important to remember that asylum-seekers arriving in Britain are often from countries where Britain has contributed to their disruption — either by arming current conflicts or through the enduring legacy of colonialism.\nRather than pulling up the drawbridge, the government should be recognising and making amends for Britain’s historic and contemporary complicity in the forced displacement of people.\nContrary to the mistruths peddled by this government, asylum-seekers do not arrive in Britain to leech off the state — Asylum Support Allowance is a mere £37.75 per week.\nIt is also far from the case that Britain is overwhelmed with asylum-seekers, with Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and France registering far more asylum applicants.\nIn the sixth-richest country in the world, there is no reason why we cannot provide a humane pathway towards stability and dignity for everyone in this country.\nWe must also remember that 83 per cent of worldwide refugees live in so called “developing regions” — not industrialised countries — which further reflects the grim, unbalanced nature of global power dynamics\nTime and again, this government has chosen to turn its back on those seeking protection from war, torture, climate catastrophe and other awful circumstances.\nThis Bill will compound the misery of people fleeing intolerable conditions driven by poverty, war and climate change.\nThe Bill does nothing to close detention centres and cease the practice of indefinite detention and does nothing to end the destructive demonisation of refugees and asylum-seekers.\nIf they come for one, they come for all. Our solidarity must demand the government abandon this deeply damaging Nationality and Borders Bill — we cannot let them get away with this.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-backdoor-changes-in-medical-associate-roles-are-intended-to-confuse-and-increase-profits/content_181.html": "The backdoor changes in ‘medical associate’ roles are intended to confuse and increase profits\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe expansion of ‘physician associates’ is intended to blur the lines between doctors and non-doctors to make the NHS more profitable for big business. We must take every opportunity to end it, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nSINCE warnings were first raised about the dangers of the government’s plans to expand the use, and in many cases the responsibilities, of “physician associates” and “anaesthetist associates,” the issue has begun to gain traction in the public mind.\nAt first, almost no politicians were coming out against the government’s planned backdoor legislation, by means of a scarcely scrutinised “statutory instrument,” changing the regulation of associate roles.\nUnder the new instrument, these will be regulated by the General Medical Council (GMC), the body that regulates doctors, even though these new roles do not have medical training.\nWhen the legislation was debated, in a parliamentary side room, I was the only MP to oppose it, even after former health secretary Therese Coffey spoke glowingly of the idea of having three anaesthetist associates monitoring patients’ anaesthesia during operations while one fully qualified anaesthetist monitored them remotely.\nBut as the issue has gained traction in the public arena, the debate about the government’s changes has become wide enough that there is now a lot of information out there in the public domain about this legislative change and its dangers.\nAnd it is dangerous. At least two patients have died after physician associates diagnosed trivial issues instead of the potentially fatal conditions they were really suffering. Emily Chesterton died after an embolism was treated as a calf strain and Ben Peters was sent home from accident and emergency because his serious heart issue was dismissed as a panic attack. Medical associates are working beyond their competence.\nA majority of appointments at GP surgeries now reportedly do not involve seeing an actual doctor. Patients are more likely to see an associate or other role without medical training than see a physician, often without realising they haven’t seen a doctor.\nMedical bodies such as the BMA, the Doctors Association and others have been vocal in their objections, forcefully and in detail. In a BMA survey, 90 per cent of doctors said that the lack of clarity about associate roles puts patients in danger. A similar percentage said that NHS management’s prioritisation of associate training meant that training and development opportunities for doctors were much harder to obtain.\nAnd doctors themselves are taking to social media to highlight the effects of the push to use associates, pointing out concrete cases in which doctors are pushed out of care in favour of increasing associate numbers. Doctors have reported being unable to find GP roles, despite completing their training, because so many surgeries are privately run and are looking only for associates to maximise profits.\nThe issue has started to grab the attention of a few parliamentarians, with the result that later this month the House of Lords will vote on a “fatal motion” to kill the statutory instrument. Tragically for patients, any chance of the motion succeeding depends on support from Labour.\nKeir Starmer and his health team have promised more private involvement in the NHS, refused to commit to overturning spending cuts and supported the so-called NHS Long Term Workforce Plan of which the trebling and expansion of associates forms part. There is no reason to think they will support the fatal motion.\nThe government’s statutory instrument and conversation around it paint a picture in which the main issue with the use of these associate roles is one of regulation and that regulating through the GMC will solve this.\nBut to an objective observer it is abundantly clear that the real reason for this change is political — it is, entirely intentionally, part of the government’s drive to “downskill” the NHS workforce, under cover of the “integrated care” plan, to lower wage costs and open up even bigger profits for private health providers.\nYou do not need to scratch very far below the surface to find instances of honesty about this among NHS managers and executives. In one meeting, think tank executives were told: “If we can keep our spending below [set costs] then we will share in some of the savings, and that’s the basis for the accountable care organisation contracts.” The person who told them that became the NHS’s “national director of transformation” and only left the role last June.\nNHS England’s strategy unit was enthusiastic. It wrote: “It is a simple and attractive concept, offering a commissioner the opportunity to co-opt and incentivise a provider to moderate growth in healthcare demand by sharing in the savings or cost over-runs.”\nThe drive to expand the numbers and use of “associates” with less training and on lower pay is just one plank of this system of perverse incentives, a whole set of policies that are dismantling the health service in order to create profit opportunities, and in which “integrated care” units are rewarded for providing less, or poorer, care.\nThe surreptitious nature of this change, which is such a part of why it is so dangerous to patients, is also clear. Jeannie Watkins, at the time the president of the Faculty of Physician Associates, talked to camera of the drive to rename “assistant roles” to “associates.” She told her interviewer that the change meant that “we can blur lines between professions.”\nIf the Lords motion to kill this statutory instrument fails later this month and the legislation comes into force, what then? First, it’s clear that we need to escalate even further the public information campaign. We need to repeat the dangers again and again to make patients aware that the associate treating them might look like a doctor but that these are non-doctor roles.\nAnd both politicians and medical representative groups need to be louder still that the use, naming and regulation of these roles as if they are medically trained will always be confusing and dangerous for patients as well as undermining the professionalism of the health service — and that changing the regulatory framework will not reduce that danger.\nUltimately, a major aim needs to be, as some have argued, a review of associate courses, redeploying existing associates away from primary patient care or contact roles until the normal process of “churn” does away with its current construct and transforms the role; or better still, where possible, to offer full medical training to associates so they can become actual doctors, GPs and anaesthetists and the associate role can be phased out or reversed to properly being an assistant. Many also argue that we should do away with the role altogether.\nAnd of course, every user of the NHS and everyone who works in our health service must insist that the government fills doctor positions with doctors, training as many as are needed, not replacing doctors with associates who have far less training.\nThat message should be directed to the doctor and patient organisations that have so far been willing to go along with the government’s changes — and to all parliamentarians, think tanks and lobby groups who are busy pushing this and other changes that are leaving our NHS a hollowed-out profit-generator.\nWe must make sure that we show our support and solidarity for all the hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses and midwives who are being constantly undermined, undercut and replaced by a government seeking to reward donors while patients and staff suffer.\nWhatever the result in the Lords later this month, the fact of the attempt to kill this Bill is an opportunity to shout why it needs to be killed — and a springboard to build public awareness of the political establishment’s past and ongoing war on our health and our health service.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_palestine-activists-are-planning-to-besiege-an-israeli-weapons-factory/content_711.html": "Gus* has never fancied himself an activist. Sure, he wore an Anti-Nazi League badge as a teenager in the 1970s, but in the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire, who didn’t? Eventually, Gus settled down – had kids, took a job in operations, moved to Leicester – and work and family became his priorities. “When you’re consumed in work for 50, 60 hours a week, you let the world run past you,” he tells Novara Media on a call. Only since he retired two years ago did he decide to do more than vote for Labour every five years.\nLast year, Gus saw a Tommy Robinson counter-demo in Telford advertised on Twitter and – sensing an opportunity to make good his adolescent anti-fascism – travelled alone to attend it. Then in March, he went to a local protest following Gary Lineker’s suspension from the BBC, where he was handed a flyer about a talk the following night. There he learned something that shocked him: he’d spent over a decade living around the corner from an Israeli weapons factory, and a group of activists was planning to shut it down. Having never even been a member of a political party, Gus was now part of a siege.\nRed boiler suits.\nOn 1 April, Palestine Action (PA) was only half-joking when it served Elbit Systems with an eviction notice. On 1 May, the group plans to occupy the Israeli weapons company’s Leicester factory for the second time in just over a year. Founded in July 2020 by a pair of longtime pro-Palestine activists disillusioned with polite resistance – co-founder Huda Ammori quit her job at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign after tiring of the NGO model of political campaigning – PA has earned a reputation as one of the UK’s most militant direct action groups. Andrew Feinstein, a South African anti-apartheid activist, arms trade expert and PA advisor, called the group “undoubtedly the most effective campaign against a specific arms company I’ve seen anywhere in the world”.\nThe group’s sole target, Elbit Systems, is Israel’s largest private weapons manufacturer, which happens to have a major UK manufacturing base. PA’s preferred tactics are raids and occupations; images of its activists in red boiler suits and black balaclavas scaling and spraypainting redbrick buildings have become fixtures across mainstream media. Since launching, PA has occupied all five of Elbit’s UK sites, one of which the company sold off last January after multiple rooftop occupations; the company also abandoned its London HQ in the summer after PA activists occupied and defaced it. The Siege, which starts on 1 May, will see PA return to the Leicester factory they first occupied two years ago (activists were eventually removed by police after six days).\nAt a time when many activists are feeling burned out by intensifying crises and relentless repression, PA keeps upping the ante. How do they do it? Feinstein attributes PA’s success in part to its laser focus on one target. Just as activists in his home country targeted Barclays and Royal Dutch Shell for their engagement with the apartheid government, rather than attempting to pressure the entire banking or oil sector, he says that PA has chosen its target “very cleverly”.\nThis narrow focus has enabled the group to keep its eyes on the prize: PA is often highly specific about the weaponry made in the factories it targets, linking these directly to attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. It’s disrupting this supply chain, rather than tarnishing Elbit’s reputation, that is the group’s absolute focus – and in this, they’ve been remarkably successful.\nIn January last year, PA estimated that its actions had cost Elbit around £15m; that figure has since grown exponentially. In November, the company’s share price dropped 18%, which the company claimed was due to stock price-linked employee compensation plans. In December news broke that was far harder to explain away: Elbit lost a ministry of defence (MoD) contract worth £160m, with another £123m contract hanging in the balance.\nGiven the deep ties between Elbit – which as well as its own factories, operates out of three Royal Air Force sites – and the British state, Feinstein says the significance of this news cannot be overstated. He links it directly to PA’s disruption of Elbit’s manufacturing operations: “Obviously the MoD would never say this, but […] [Elbit is] now an unreliable supplier.”\nBuoyed by their success in Oldham, the Siege will differ from PA’s previous actions in one crucial way: whereas all of PA’s past protests have been planned in secret, this one is being publicised; the talk Gus attended in March was one of around 15 PA has held in towns and cities across the north and midlands.\nSpeaking to Novara Media, Ammori says that this decision was made in part to attract people like Gus: locals who might not usually engage in “highly specialised, secretive actions”, but who want ways to get involved with PA. It’s a pivot not dissimilar to that of Extinction Rebellion, which earlier this year announced that it would temporarily ditch disruptive action led by a crack team of activists in favour of more peaceful mass mobilisation.\n“This is about opening up [our activism] to the local community,” she says. It helps that the community in question is primed for engagement.\nA double effect.\n“The Palestinian cause is not just a Muslim cause, but we feel the double effect of it because of the religious connection.” Abu Hamza* speaks to me on the eve of his annual Ramadan trip to Al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem. The 43-year-old is one of the 86,443 Muslims that according to the latest census lives in Leicester, a city which has produced some of the country’s best-known Palestine activism: Friends of Al-Aqsa was established there in 1997.\nFor Abu Hamza, Palestine activism is the water he swims in: as a teenager, he remembers being bussed down to pro-Palestine demos in London. Still, he and many locals have spent their whole lives unaware they were living right next to an Israeli weapons factory – the outrage at Elbit that PA has sown, he says, has “given the movement energy” – and attracted a great deal of local support.\nThe last time PA occupied Elbit’s Leicester factory, located in the Meridian Business Park, business owners came down and provided free food; the fire brigade refused the police’s request (at the time, a spokesperson for the Fire Brigades Union said that the organisation “stand[s] in support of Palestinian solidarity and the right to protest”) to remove the occupiers. When the police finally came, hundreds of locals blocked the factory gates for eight hours before the cops put on their riot gear and broke through the crowd. Two years later and with the Israeli occupation intensifying under a new far-right government (just last week, footage emerged of Israeli police beating worshippers at Al-Aqsa), Abu Hamza reckons “they’ll have [even] more sympathy now.”\nShareefa Energy is evidence of this. The 33-year-old local poet is part of Shut Elbit Down Leicester, a local campaign that grew out of PA’s first occupation and has since been holding regular demos outside the factory and organising nearby banner drops, keeping the ground warm until the next PA escalation. Speaking to Novara Media, she says that PA’s savviness has been targeting a community already politically invested in the takedown of the Israeli arms trade – and now, personally so. “It’s about re-owning responsibility for the local community,” she says.\nThe group has the support of local independent MP Claudia Webbe: “In the absence of the government taking immediate action to end all sales of weapons that could be used unlawfully against Palestinian people,” Webbe told Novara Media, “I believe direct action in the form of peaceful protest is justified.”\n‘We’re already criminalised.’\nIf the community wants the factory shut down, will the police stop them? In a statement to Novara Media, a spokesperson for Leicestershire police said: “We respect the right to peaceful protest and an appropriate policing plan will be in place.” They added they’d been in touch with Elbit Systems.\nGiven the escalating state crackdown on protest through the Policing, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and now, the public order bill, Ammori doubts the police will “respect” PA’s activists, but doesn’t care. “We’re already criminalised in the eyes of the state. Adding a few different versions of laws doesn’t make much of an impact. If anything, it’s more of a reason to take direct action.” She may also be emboldened by the fact that legal repression of PA has mostly floundered: in September, charges against five of its activists were dropped due to a lack of evidence.\nFor his own part, arrest doesn’t scare Gus. “I’ve been a football fan for a number of years,” he tells Novara Media. “I’ve felt the rough end of a truncheon for no good reason.” He also isn’t exactly worried about the professional consequences: “I’ve got less to lose, I haven’t got a future ahead of me, [I’m not worried about] being tarred [as] a troublemaker.” This isn’t to say he’s going out looking for trouble, just that he sees potential arrest as a small price to pay: “I don’t intend to be arrested, but the greater principle of this is that there are people that are suffering death and families being ripped apart, and if you’re not prepared to stand up for the right values in life, then it will continue unabated.”\n*Names have been changed.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_africa-and-the-western-lust-for-power-and-control/content_21.html": "Africa and the Western lust for power and control\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nNeocolonialism still ravages the African continent with war and debt. Niger and other nations are right to refuse it, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHE humanitarian disaster of wars which have destroyed Yemen, destroyed Libya and ravaged huge parts of west Africa are not a phenomenon intrinsic to Africa, but one that has been inflicted on it by centuries of colonial greed and control — and continues to be perpetuated by the neocolonial ambitions of so-called “developed” nations now.\nIt is a phenomenon fuelled by the greed of corporations for mineral wealth and enabled by governments beholden to their donations and corrupted by the revolving door between government and big business. And it is one that cannot be allowed to continue.\nIt’s not hard to see why Western powers want to control access to Africa’s mineral resources — the stakes are huge.\nAccording to the United Nations, Africa is home to around a third of the world’s mineral wealth, 12 per cent of its oil and 8 per cent of its natural gas.\nIn 2019 alone, it produced almost a billion tonnes of minerals at a value of around $409 billion.\nIn Africa and further afield, the Western lust for power and control, directly or by proxy, and that hunger for resources have seen Western governments wage wars, prop up dictators and excuse oppression while civilians suffer and die.\nThe bombing of Libya in 2011 by Britain, France and the United States under the aegis of Nato and others are atrocities that continues to be felt today.\nYet when devastating floods in Libya caused thousands of deaths earlier this month, the British media reported that the effects of the flooding were worsened by years of infighting in the country, with little mention of the impact of damage inflicted by Western military and political power.\nGlobal military expenditure reached $2.24 trillion in 2022. Africa’s share of this was 1.8 per cent, compared to 40 per cent for North America and 21 per cent for Europe.\nAll over Africa, the West has built military bases — including the largest drone base in the world in Agadez, Niger, built by the US.\nFormer Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah noted that “neocolonialism seeks to fragment Africa, weaken African state institutions, prevent African unity and sovereignty, and so insert its power to subordinate the aspirations of the continent for pan-African consolidation.”\nThus, it can be argued that the enduring presence of foreign military bases not only symbolises the lack of unity and sovereignty among African nations; it also enforces and exacerbates the fragmentation and subordination of the continent’s peoples and governments.\nIt would be my argument that Niger today reflects the hope of a generation wanting to break free from France’s neocolonial grip on the country — a situation perversely triggered by a military coup, but one that reportedly has the support of two out of three of the people of Niger (Nigeriens).\nTo understand that support, it is important to understand the neocolonial structures that have allowed French companies to leech the natural resources of the region — such as uranium from Niger, which powers a third of French lightbulbs — and which have forced these countries to crush their people’s hopes through an enduring debt and austerity agenda driven by the International Monetary Fund.\nThe planned $13bn, 1,200-mile pipeline that Western nations wanted to build across Niger and Benin to carry Nigerian gas for European consumption, to little benefit for the local communities, appears to have been the final straw for the people of Niger.\nIn Niger, the West first wanted the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) to invade Niger on their behalf and restore the deposed, allegedly more Western-friendly president to office, but mass unrest in the Ecowas member states, including condemnations from trade unions and people’s organisations, stayed the hands of that organisation’s regional “peacekeeping forces.”\nMeanwhile, the governments of Burkina Faso and Mali, which have sent troops to Niger, have said that any military intervention against the government of Niger will be taken as an invasion of their own countries.\nIn Nigeria, the senate voted to reject President Bola Tinubu’s proposal to send troops to Niger and demanded that he explore peaceful measures instead.\nThus far, this military coup and aspiration of Nigeriens and the support and actions of neighbouring governments have led to French President Emmanuel Macron announcing the withdrawal of all French troops from Niger’s territory, along with embassy staff.\nOf course, there are unacceptable deep issues with government change forced by military takeover.\nBut arguably it is important for us to understand the history that brought Niger to where it is today — including the argument that we can no longer deny a new mood of defiance in the global South, as evidenced also by the recent requests from 23 more nations to join the Brics bloc of nations, the international grouping of developing nations formed originally by Brazil, India, Russia and China, and then joined by South Africa.\nThis defiance extends to governments in the global South not accepting the “Western view” of the conflict in Ukraine nor universally supporting Nato in its efforts to “weaken Russia.”\nArguably, the global South is reorganising to pursue its own interests. Its people are fed up with the IMF-driven debt-austerity cycle and what could be described as bullying by the West. Instead, a non-aligned internationalism is emerging.\nThe term has its origins in the Non-Aligned Conference held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961, which had built upon the foundations laid at the Asian-African conference held in Bandung (Indonesia) in 1955.\nKwame Nkrumah famously said: “We face neither East nor West; we face forward.”\nHe said it at a time when African nations were pulling away from their European colonisers, while the US and Soviet Union were vying for influence and France and Britain were clinging to theirs.\nNkrumah recognised that Africans and their governments needed to set their own course, for their own interests, and not be beholden to the interests of “former rulers.”\nOur role as socialists and advocates for peace must mean that we must continue to challenge the IMF — and its role in exacerbating the poverty brought on by colonialism and transforming it into a permanent debt crisis all too easily exploited by nations that grew wealthy to the detriment of the colonised.\nThe governments of the global West keep “the market” happy, at the expense of a downward spiral of living conditions for the vast majority of the people on the planet.\nInstead of a permanent debt crisis of global South countries we need peaceful debt strikes. The stranglehold over global South countries must be overcome through peaceful — but resolute and relentless — defiance.\nThe extraction of minerals by Western corporations has long driven abuse, murder, slavery and suffering in African nations blessed and, some may argue, cursed with mineral riches that the West covets.\nThis rivalry among superpowers is finding its expression either in military build-up or in the effective mass theft of resources that destroys ecosystems and oppresses Africa’s people.\nThis escalation endangers not just Africa, but the world — yet governments in the West are unwilling to acknowledge the danger, let alone act to reduce it.\nAfrican nations are refusing to leave the matter in the hands of recalcitrant governments of the global North and are taking matters into their own hands to enable full liberation.\nWhile we may disagree sometimes with the means and mechanisms of this defiance, we cannot say that they are wrong to defy — because they are not. Until Africa is free, none of us are free.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_taking-on-the-garment-industry/content_654.html": "Taking on the garment industry\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe have to face down the government’s bonfire of regulations, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP — businesses, retailers and brands who profit from the exploitation of Leicester’s garment workers need more scrutiny and supervision, not less\nThe government’s plan to remove small and medium businesses from regulation is typical of a madcap government that loves announcements but ignores reality as we have already seen in Kwasi Kwarteng’s U-turn on tax cuts. We need clarity urgently and in reality, we need more regulation and enforcement, not less.\nSince being elected to represent my home city, I have been campaigning to end the scourge of exploitation that has plagued sections of Leicester’s garment industry for decades. Leicester is a tragic example of how the fast-fashion industry creates exploitation across the world.\nThe scandalous mistreatment of workers in my community is best understood as an extreme microcosm of the national and global decay of workers’ rights during the failed neoliberal project of the last 40 years.\nDuring the pandemic, there was a resurgence of much needed attention which highlighted the severe exploitation in sections of our garment industry. Yet the issue has not dissipated with the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions and is actually getting far worse with the economic downturn — as a number of recent events have made clear.\nA recent report funded by Boohoo and commissioned by the Garment and Textiles Workers Trust charity revealed the enduring extent of abysmal working conditions in Leicester’s garment industry. Yet it refused to look in the mirror at the fast-fashion brands who are the true engine of garment industry exploitation.\nThe report by the University of Nottingham and De Montfort University found that more than half of the Leicester garment workers surveyed are paid below the minimum wage, receive no holiday or sick pay, are refused breaks and are put under pressure to work long shifts.\nThe report contained some welcome recommendations, particularly a single point of contact for workers wishing to make a complaint to enforcement agencies. Currently, the regulatory system is overly complex, ineffective and underfunded. Yet these recommendations do not go nearly far enough.\nSadly, the report entirely ignores the culpability of fast-fashion companies like boohoo, and instead pushes the blame onto the factories and indeed the workers themselves by arguing they lack the language or knowledge to raise a claim against their own exploitation.\nYet this is not the fault of the workers, who are afraid to speak out for fear of reprisals and redundancy. The report has an overwhelming focus on “employability” and “language skills” as causes of labour market abuses and does not include fast-fashion brands and companies as “drivers” of exploitation.\nDespite minimum wage laws, a very recent government report by the Low Pay Commission found that many Leicester people in garment factories are afraid to report being underpaid because of the possible consequences for them in their workplace or even the threat of losing their job. The same fear prevents many people reporting abuse and appalling violations in workplace safety and practices.\nMy casework on all of this is huge; unscrupulous bosses find new ways of exploiting workers, under-reporting hours, denying sick pay, refusing holiday pay, forcing them to work overtime for a pittance, reducing their hours without notice, sending them home without work or pay and banning workers from organising to fight together for better pay, conditions and rights.\nThe only solution is both rapid government action, legislative reform and active trade union involvement to protect workers and improve pay and conditions. It is therefore highly duplicitous that Boohoo, which has both refused to recognise and mobilised to quash union activity in Leicester and across Britain, commissioned this lopsided report which ignores the main drivers and solutions to garment industry exploitation.\nThe exploited labour of Leicester residents is also helping to finance extravagant corporate salaries. Sales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have helped reward Boohoo’s bosses with bonuses worth £150 million. The obscene wealth of the few can no longer be built on the exploitation of the many.\nFor as long as Boohoo and other fast-fashion companies refuse to recognise trade unions and sell clothes for a few pounds, it is workers who will pay the price. Garment industry employees in Leicester need and deserve more than this warped PR exercise from a company with a long history of supply chain malpractice.\nThe last few months have also witnessed the shambolic mismanagement of Missguided, who placed their profits over the livelihoods of those who produce their clothes.\nMany Leicester-based garment industries provide garments to Missguided, and they were treated abysmally by the company in recent months — with payments to suppliers stopped despite bogus orders that were not delivered to customers still being raked in by the company. Some suppliers were not even informed of halted payments but have simply not been paid.\nThese underhand tactics are shameful. More than a dozen providers, many in Leicester, were collectively owed millions of pounds for orders, some of which were placed as late as the month prior to the collapse of the company. A full investigation, including recompense for all workers and small businesses impacted, must be undertaken.\nWorst of all, due to Missguided’s reckless approach many garment industry workers — in Leicester and across the UK — have lost their income during an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis.\nAs a result of the widespread proliferation of unacceptable zero-hours contracts across the garment industry, too many workers in Leicester do not have adequate protection during this squeeze on living standards.\nIt is vital that the government and the Frasers Group, who have stepped in to buy Missguided after their collapse, take rapid and widespread action to support workers in Missguided’s supply chains, both by helping to secure their jobs and by guaranteeing that all lost income due to Missguided’s underhand businesses practices is repaid.\nThe fashion industry also has a massive impact on our planet. It has faced virtually no regulation, which has tipped off a race to the bottom where the companies with the least regard for the environment and for people have the greatest competitive edge.\nApparel and footwear are responsible for a massive part of the climate crisis, occupying nearly 9 per cent of the world’s global greenhouse gas footprint — more than France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined. Currently, there are no legally binding environmental standards enacted through government regulation.\nLeft unregulated, the industry is projected to be responsible for more than 25 per cent of the world’s global carbon budget by 2050. The industry produces 100 billion garments a year for 7 billion people and almost all of it (87 per cent) will end up in a landfill or an incinerator. The industry also consumes approximately 100 million tons of oil every year.\nThe production of synthetic textiles, which amounts to 60 per cent of global clothing, is responsible for 35 per cent of all ocean microplastics that are now in our food chain. It contributes 20 per cent of all industrial wastewater and pollutes freshwater systems from the use of toxic chemicals, dyes, and heavy metals that harm the environment and people.\nFast-fashion giant Shein has just become the largest online-only retailer in the world. According to CEO Molly Miao, the company releases between 700 and 1,000 new items a day. This is patently unsustainable. As well as contributing to the climate crisis, fast fashion also relies on exploiting people within the supply chain. In order to mass-produce clothes and sell them at such a heavily discounted rate, costs have to be cut.\nI have been campaigning for the government to introduce a Fashion Watchdog or Garment Trade Adjudicator, similar to the Groceries Code Adjudicator, to ensure that terms to suppliers are ethical, fair, climate friendly and sustainable. This would be essential in tackling the environmental issues plaguing the fast-fashion industry.\nI helped to launch the Fashion-workers Advice Bureau Leicester (FAB-L), formerly known as L-GWASP (Leicester Garment Workers Advice and Support Project), a grassroots initiative to tackle wage exploitation in Leicester’s garment industry. The government must encourage and support this initiative and others like it.\nTrade unions are the best line of defence against workplace exploitation, and employers and the government must open the door for their involvement. There is no existing duty to prevent exploitation by brands who are supplied by manufacturers in Leicester and across Britain. I have been campaigning for a statutory mandatory human rights and due diligence responsibility to be introduced for the entire textile and clothing industry.\nYet, instead of providing workers with the protection they need through better and more effective regulation, we see a government that wants to sweep away what’s already there — and can’t be bothered to give any detail about its plan.\nLeicester’s garment industry is indicative of the abrupt decline in workers’ rights and living standards since the neoliberal deindustrialisation revolution which began in the 1980s.\nThe fact that a job no longer provides a route out of poverty represents an unforgiveable breakdown in our social contract. This is not an economic inevitability, but rather the result of a deliberate upwards transfer of wealth and power away from working people.\nThe scandal in Leicester’s garment industry is in many ways the logical conclusion of the neoliberal project, which has for decades slashed away at our social safety net.\nThe super-rich and their representatives in government believe that the mistreatment of workers is inevitable — that rights, fair pay, and dignity in the workplace are an unacceptable cost to their bottom line. Yet their free market race to the bottom has normalised poverty, hopelessness and exploitation in our communities.\nNow is the time for us on the left to fight for a society built around the principles of solidarity and in which all of us, regardless of our job, can live in dignity.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-must-stand-internationally-with-brazilians-resisting-bolsonaro/content_852.html": "We must stand internationally with Brazilians resisting Bolsonaro\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nBrazil’s mass protests against Bolsonaro and the far-right show that the country is at a tipping point. Our international solidarity is vital for those fighting for social progress, democracy and public health writes Claudia Webbe, UK Member of Parliament.\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nGrowing dissatisfaction with far-right Jair Bolsonaro’s record as President of Brazil – particularly his appalling and deadly mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic – has fuelled a wave of popular protest across the country. The growing demand for his resignation has also been reflected in Brazilian communities around the world, including here in Britain.\nBolsonaro’s term as president has proved disastrous for Brazil. Even according to official figures which are widely thought to recklessly under-estimate the problem; the country has suffered more than 500,000 deaths in the pandemic and infections have surged again in recent months.\nBolsonaro’s critics have pointed to his opposition to lockdown measures, his failure to prioritise the purchase of vaccines and his overall downplaying of the severity of the disease as key factors in the devastating impact that it has had on the population.\nIn addition to the tragic loss of lives, unemployment in Brazil is expected to increase to at least 2.5 million, with serious knock-on effects on already steepening poverty and extreme poverty rates.\nUnsurprisingly, Bolsonaro’s approval ratings in opinion polls have been dropping, with those considering the government as “great” or “good” falling from 31% to 23%. Currently, 45% of Brazilians consider Bolsonaro’s administration “bad” or “terrible” compared to 32% at the end of last year.\nSince April, Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic has been under investigation by the Senate. Legislators heard that in keeping with Bolsonaro’s dismissal of coronavirus as “a little flu”, he was resistant to buying COVID-19 vaccines, preferring to bet on ‘herd immunity’ as the way to beat the coronavirus.\nEvidence uncovered by the inquiry also pointed to potential illegalities in the way that the Indian vaccine Covaxin was acquired. A senior official at the Health Ministry testified before the Senate that he had been pressured to authorise the import of the vaccine and pay $45 million in advance to a third company.\nThe official also said in his evidence that he had requested Bolsonaro to authorise an investigation into the deal but to no effect, although federal prosecutors subsequently opened a case on the contract, citing a number of red flags about how it was managed.\nThese revelations have galvanised politicians from a broad spectrum, together with social movements, trade unions and indigenous groups, to submit a request to the country’s lower house for the impeachment of Bolsonaro, citing 24 alleged crimes. It is reported that 54% of Brazilians support opening such proceedings.\nMeanwhile, Bolsonaro’s latest plans are draining away his support in the country. Opposition has been mounting to his extreme neo-liberal reforms, which have included budget cuts and the privatisation of public companies. Such moves are driven by ideology, with no care at all for the social and economic consequences for millions of people.\nAs part of this rampant sell-off programme, in mid-July Bolsonaro approved a Bill paving the way for the further privatisation of the electricity company Electrobras, which produces 30% of the country´s power.\nFormer President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that the sale will endanger Brazil’s energy security, while others have warned of higher prices for consumers to finance the company’s expansion plans.\nAs marches and protests take place month by month, and despite protesters being met with disproportionate use of force by the police, including the use of tear gas, the beneficiary of this upswelling of anti-Bolsonaro feeling is former president Lula.\nIn a recent survey of more than 2,000 Brazilians conducted by the Institute for Research and Consulting Intelligence (Ipec), Lula led in voting intentions for the 2022 presidential election, with 49% saying they would vote for him compared to 23% for Bolsonaro. No other potential candidates could muster a double-digit showing.\nPublic rejection of Bolsonaro is also on the increase in terms of voting intentions, according to the survey. 62% of those surveyed said they would not be voting for Bolsonaro at all, up from 56% in a poll conducted in February. By contrast, those rejecting a vote for Lula fell from February’s 44% to 36% in the latest poll.\nBut Bolsonaro has already given notice that he would challenge a win by Lula in the presidential election. He argues that the current electronic voting system, adopted more than two decades ago and used during the 2018 elections that brought him to power, allows fraud.\nHe recently said that “if that method continues, we are going to have problems because one side may not accept the result. And that side, obviously, will be our side.”\nIn these dangerous words, we see how the far-right will do all it can to cling on to power in Brazil, and Bolsonaro has again shown his utter contempt for democracy.\nWhile Lula’s release from political imprisonment and return to political life provides a progressive and hopeful alternative in Brazilian public life, it is clear the road to the 2022 elections remains a challenging and difficult one. We must stand internationally with all those Brazilians heroically resisting Bolsonaro and standing up for public health, democracy, equality and social progress.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-must-stand-with-the-brazilian-people-against-bolsonaro-in-the-fight-for-public-health/content_737.html": "We must stand with the Brazilian people against Bolsonaro in the fight for public health\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nOfficial statistics showed that, as of last Tuesday, over 5,000 Brazilians had lost their lives to Covid-19. At the time of writing, that figure now stands at 8,588. The number of confirmed cases has exceeded 100,000 – making it the worst affected country in Latin America. But when asked last week about the 474 deaths that day, and the total deaths exceeding 5,000, Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro shrugged off the news. “So what? I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?”\nThis was just the latest in a series of remarks and actions from the President belittling the threat of the pandemic. Indeed, since the giant Latin American country confirmed its first Covid-19 case on February 26th, he has regularly and angrily rejected media ‘hysteria’ over the danger. He has frequently attacked social distancing guidelines and the thinking behind them, even sacking his health minister after he publicly challenged the President’s position.\nBolsonaro has regularly flouted social distancing himself, including by attending far-right protests. He was at this again on Sunday, May 3rd, when he took to the streets. Echoing an earlier rally he attended in April, protestors again called for the closing of the supreme court and congress – as well as a return to dictatorial measures used in Brazil’s 1964 to 1985 military dictatorship, which were responsible for hundreds of extrajudicial executions.\nOpponents of President Bolsonaro have argued that he has encouraged violence against journalists, and at Sunday’s rally witnesses from Reuters confirmed that at least three photographers were attacked. In this context, he is facing growing opposition to his calamitous handling of the pandemic – both in Brazil itself and internationally. With the virus now spreading into more and more of the nation’s most deprived and vulnerable communities, and the peak of the pandemic not yet reached, there is great concern about how much more tragedy could unfold in Brazil. And it is widely thought that significant underreporting means that the official figures don’t capture the true scale of the crisis.\nThere is also growing global concern at the fate of indigenous peoples in the country. On the same day that Bolsonaro was protesting, health minister Nelson Teich travelled to Manaus in the Amazon region due to the drastically deteriorating situation there. Dozens of prominent public figures across the world have signed an open letter to the Brazilian government, calling on it to protect indigenous peoples, who often live in remote locations with extremely limited access to healthcare.\nRenowned photographer Sebastião Salgado and other signatories have argued that communities in the Amazon are at risk of being “completely eliminated” by miners who have increased their operations during the health crisis. He described how “these illicit operations have accelerated in recent weeks”. And it should be remembered that Bolsonaro is a President whose actions, since assuming office, have been relentlessly hostile to the indigenous population. Since his election, Brazil’s indigenous peoples have been in nothing less than a historic and heroic struggle for survival.\nDespite widespread international condemnation, and the horrific Amazon fires, Bolsonaro has continued to encourage deforestation of the Amazon. He has dismantled the government agencies supposed to protect both the environment and indigenous peoples, as well as slashing their budgets and sacking top officials. For progressives around the world, it is particularly vital that we stand in solidarity with Brazil’s indigenous peoples, for whom highly infectious diseases such as coronavirus pose a devastating threat. And this solidarity with Brazil’s indigenous peoples must also extend to standing with all those in Brazil arguing for a different response to Bolsonaro’s disastrous policies.\nThe health crisis has shown that the likes of Bolsonaro and Donald Trump are far from champions of the poor and excluded, but in fact will always put interests of big business and private profit first. But there is a better way. This is an international crisis and it demands an international response that prioritises people and not profit. As part of this, we must stand with all those fighting for policies to address the coronavirus crisis around the world that are based on saving lives and putting public health first, including those demanding such an approach in Brazil.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-ongoing-horrors-of-manipur-should-concern-us-all/content_366.html": "The ongoing horrors of Manipur should concern us all\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe shocking videos of women being abused as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing must provoke us to finally take action on this brutal injustice, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIN Manipur, it seems the state has ceased to exist; recent months have seen horrific events with widespread violence against Dalit communities and other minorities reaching horrific levels, with hundreds killed and injured.\nThe violence has also been gendered: as is so often the case, women are facing the worst. In Manipur, minority women have been raped and publicly humiliated as a weapon of war.\nThe latest outrage was documented in a viral video widely circulated on social media and reported upon by the international media of two Kuki-Zo women being sexually assaulted, paraded naked and raped, with disturbing footage showing the women weeping, crying in pain and begging their attackers to show mercy.\nAs more stories emerge, 80-year-old widow Sorokhaibam Ibetombi was burned alive, locked in her home by an armed mob who set it alight, and Thiendam Vaiphei was murdered at the hands of another mob who burned her and cut her throat.\nThis violence, particularly against women, is sadly not a new phenomenon. A 2014 report by the International Dalit Solidarity Network noted that “violence against Dalit women is systematically utilised to deny them opportunities, choices and freedoms at multiple levels, undermining not only Dalit women’s dignity and self-respect but also their right to development.” The report goes on to argue that:\n“[We] need to make Dalit women visible to the public eye through exposing their reality of violence and disempowerment intrinsically related to their social position, in recognition of their selfhood and human dignity.”\nHuman Rights Watch agreed, adding that prosecution for such violence against minority women is extremely rare, even for rapes and gang rapes: a “pattern of impunity.”\nAs so often happens, this latest eruption of violence was linked to corporate greed for access to and control of coveted mineral resources.\nThe Geological Survey of India has “discovered” the presence of nickel, copper and platinum group elements as well as magnetite, widely used in catalysis, and other valuable minerals. This discovery appears to have triggered demands from the majority Meitei people for Scheduled Tribe Status (STS); protection to promote social justice by providing positive discrimination and affirmative action for members of the most deprived and disadvantaged Indian tribes and “castes,” that was put in place shortly after Indian independence.\nThe criterion for scheduled status requires a people group to be marginalised and essentially defined as “untouchable” and to live excluded from nearby cultures.\nThey must “live apart in the hills, and even where they live in plains, they lead a separate excluded existence and are not fully assimilated in the main body of the people. Scheduled tribes may belong to any religion. They are listed as scheduled tribes because of the kind of life led by them.”\nDespite the issues with this, in May the Manipur High Court ordered the state government to recommend the extension of STS to the majority Meitei people, which would give widespread access to the hills where the mineral resources have been “discovered,” potentially relegating the indigenous Kuki-Zomi and Naga hill people to bystanders as their environment is degraded by corporate mineral extraction.\nThe concerns for the environment are well-founded. Only this week, the national government has been accused of “destroying” the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu by allowing mineral extraction by a company directly controlled by the government, despite widespread and ongoing protests by local farmers and communities.\nThe Supreme Court of India condemned the Manipur High Court ruling as “completely factually wrong.” However, the Manipur state government — which, like the national government, is led by the BJP — had asked only for an extension to the High Court order and not to have it stayed or overturned, so only an extension was granted. A number of corporations with reportedly close ties to the ruling BJP are eager to exploit those resources.\nNaturally, the Kuki-Zomi and Naga people were deeply worried about this development and began to protest against it – and the backlash against the protests saw massive violence.\nSo far, the BJP-led state government has been accused of standing by as a mute spectator to the violence and failing to protect the predominantly Christian hill tribes.\nThis failure to protect violates both India’s constitution and its statute, as well as the country’s obligations under international law. Article 14 of the constitution mandates: “The state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India,” while Article 15(1) provides that the “state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.”\nThe Indian penal code also provides special protections for the dignity and modesty of women and requires strict and “rigorous” punishment for rape. Instead, in Manipur and elsewhere, it is ignored and unpunished.\nIndian author and peace award-winning activist Arundhati Roy has dismissed attempts to describe events in Manipur as a civil war, instead describing the violence as ethnic cleansing, and has said that the language of “eradication” of supposed inferior groups in Manipur has become commonplace.\nThe parallels with other nations and regions torn apart because of mineral wealth are obvious. The UN names “extractive industry” as a key factor in violence in nations such as Angola, Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambodia and Afghanistan among others, whether for energy resources or rare minerals needed for the manufacture of electronics.\nIn all those places, violence against women as a tool of control and intimidation is a prominent feature of mining-related oppression. A report by the IndustriAll union found that gender-based violence, harassment and exploitation are “pervasive” in the global mining industry, even in the absence of conflict.\nThe horrific events in these nations have shown all too clearly just how dangerous it is when the human vices of greed and envy meet the corporate appetite for material resources, leading to incitement, and dehumanising propaganda directed against minorities. The genocide in Rwanda differed only slightly, driven by greed for the land itself.\nAnd when these toxic factors combine in violence and oppression, women suffer worst, as the full weight of structural, cultural, institutional and systemic contempt and discrimination come down on them in the form of horrific and sexualised inhumanity.\nWomen in Manipur and elsewhere are regarded as instruments and human chattels, without power, voice or agency, treated as objects for the expression of rage and hate and as tools to be abused to intimidate and control their communities.\nAll these terrible, terrifying examples tell us that silence is not an option when we see the same dynamics playing out in Manipur.\nThe suffering of victims and the cries of women in Manipur demand justice and demand that we stand up and speak out in solidarity and outrage. History will not look kindly on those who turn away and let inhumanity run unchecked.\nThe international community must insist on action — at both state and national levels — to protect the vulnerable and defuse the situation and must not take no for an answer.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

The uneven deaths reflect a global economic system which has been built upon racialised extraction and subordination.\nI’ve been highlighting this issue for some time. There are high levels of child poverty inLeicester and particularly in my constituency, which is 60 per cent black, Asian and ethnic minority.\nIt’s terrible and this is the product of years of insecure working practices and ideologically-driven austerity. Communities are suffering and in areas like the east ofLeicester the inequalities are stark. People are in precarious jobs with no security and children are having to suffer living in poverty-stricken homes as a result.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_cuts-or-white-privilege-the-governments-education-culture-war/content_684.html": "Cuts or ‘white privilege?’ The government’s education culture war\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Tories are hell-bent on injecting racial tension into the debate on educational attainment to mask the obvious fact that it is their programme of cuts over the last decade that is responsible for growing inequality, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nAT A TIME when much of the world is finally facing up to the reality of structural discrimination, the government has cynically been preoccupied with creating a new narrative in which working-class communities are pitted against each other and blamed for the systemic disadvantages they face.\nBy denying the existence of institutional racism, the government’s Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities was already a slap in the face for African, Asian and minority ethnic communities and all those affected by racism. Its claim that Britain is a world-leading bastion of racial progress was nothing short of state-sanctioned gaslighting.\nYet now this damaging study has an ugly sibling, with the publication of a report published by the Conservative-dominated Commons education committee entitled The Forgotten: How White Working-Class Pupils Have Been Let Down and How to Change It.\nThe report uses cherry-picked data to claim that “an industry” has emerged to support non-white pupils and that the same is not available to white pupils on free school meals. The report also, farcically, claims that terms such as “white privilege” have contributed towards systemic neglect and underachievement of poor white pupils.\nIt is true that young people of all ethnicities, too many of whom have been left behind since long before the coronavirus crisis, have time and again been failed by this government.\nYet this report should not be taken seriously for two reasons. One being its disingenuously selective use of statistics that fail to acknowledge severe racial disparities across the educational system.\nSecondly is the report’s ludicrous claim that language choices like “white privilege” are more to blame for educational inequalities than the sustained and severe cuts to education and support for young people undertaken by the Conservatives over the last 10 years.\nIn relation to the former, it is true that white poor children struggle academically and this is something that requires urgent focus. Yet the report uses selective data to support their preconceived and divisive conclusion which attempts to pit children of different racial backgrounds against each other.\nThe education committee’s decision to focus on such an incomplete data set obscures the reality of how class and race intersect in our education system. If they had looked further, they would have seen that racial disparities exist across educational attainment, school discipline and university admissions.\nA recent study by the think tank LKMco found that teachers, in a study undertaken of London schools, are biased against black Caribbean and white boys from poorer backgrounds.\nThe report found how unconscious prejudices and bias affect the way black Caribbean boys are disciplined at school, how their work is assessed and the academic ability set that they are put in.\nBlack Caribbean boys’ attainment in London is 17 percentage points behind the London average for expected standards in reading, writing and maths by the end of primary school.\nRacial inequality is also endemic in school discipline. Government figures show that black Caribbean students are twice as likely as white students to be temporarily excluded from school and nearly three times more likely to be permanently excluded.\nResearch by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills found that black (African and African-Caribbean) A-Level students had the lowest predicted grade accuracy, with only 39 per cent of predicted grades accurate, while their white counterparts had the highest, at 53 per cent.\nTherefore, amid the coronavirus crisis, it is likely that the cancellation of A-Levels and increased reliance on predicted grades will have a disproportionately negative impact on black students.\nThis form of discrimination extends to university and beyond. The National Union of Students found that, at a university level, 77 per cent of white students received a first or 2:1 compared with 62 per cent of African, Asian and minority ethnic students in England, whilst unemployment levels immediately after university were also higher amongst African, Asian and minority ethnic students.\nThe findings of this report by the Commons education committee, therefore, are predicated on research that is at best incomplete and at worst insincere. Try as they might, the government and its outriders cannot wish away the reality of institutional racism.\nYet even worse than the substandard methodology is the pathetic attempt to explain the ethnic discrepancies in educational attainment.\nInstead of honestly accepting that children from all backgrounds have been badly let down by decades of neglect, this report attempts to create unhelpful divides between children based on their race.\nTo be clear, it was not the phrase “white privilege” that cut youth services by 73 per cent since 2010 — that was the government.\nIt was not the phrase “white privilege” that cut school funding per pupil by 9 per cent — that was the government.\nIt was not the phrase “white privilege” that closed over 750 youth centres, more than 800 libraries and over 1,000 Sure Start centres — that was the government.\nAnd it was not the phrase “white privilege” that scrapped Educational Maintenance Allowance, maintenance grants and trebled tuition fees — that was the government.\nThe government recently announced a catch-up funding package that is a tenth of what its own education adviser said was necessary to make up for the disruption of the coronavirus.\nDue to this government’s paltry support, the long-term impact of Covid-19 will exacerbate the difficulties young people already face.\nThe new funding package amounts to just £50 per pupil. For the Netherlands, this figure is £2,500 — while in the United States it is £1,600. Why does our government not place the same value on the future of our young people? This neglect is felt by all children from poorer households, regardless of their ethnicity.\nYouth services are a vital lifeline for young people, particularly those living in areas with high levels of poverty and inequality. But due to severe government cuts over the last decade, hundreds of youth centres have closed.\nIn the East Midlands, the average spending per 16 to 24-year-old fell by 50 per cent from £134 to £66 between 2012 and 2019.\nAfter already being forced to make huge cuts under the Conservatives’ austerity agenda, in 2017 Leicester City Council was forced to slash the already paltry £1.8 million a year spent on youth services by a further £923,000 — a cut of over 50 per cent.\nThis reduced the number of open access youth club sessions from 42 per week to just 12. It also significantly reduced the support for children and young people referred by social services and detached, issue-based and outreach services to at-risk young people. This pattern of neglect is replicated across the country, with devastating impacts for all young people.\nTaken together, this government’s neglect of young people is a generational betrayal. Yet they are now determined to distract from the rampant racial and class inequality that their policies have exacerbated with a trumped-up culture war that is designed to stoke up the flames of division.\nThere is a dangerous connecting current that runs between this report and many other initiatives taken by this government, including the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities. They all reveal a deeply troubling broader political project, which is designed to divide our communities against each other and distract from the real causes of class inequality and injustice.\nIt is up to those of us on the left to oppose this damaging agenda and to fight for a future in which all children receive the tools to build a happy and secure life.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Claudia Webbe, Member of Parliament for Leicester East, expressed concern after Chris Philip, a Treasury minister, suggested the Government planned to scrap regulations for businesses with fewer than 500 employees.\nWhen speaking at an event for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, Mr Philp said that the Government “will be reducing business regulation.” He added: “Jacob Rees-Mogg has a whole load of ideas to do so”.\nIn response, Ms Webbe suggested deregulation would erode working people’s rights. She said: “The Government’s plan to remove small and medium businesses from regulation is typical of a madcap government that loves announcements but ignores reality.\n“The Leicester garment industry has seen unscrupulous bosses find new ways of exploiting workers, under-reporting their hours, denying sick pay and banning them from organising to fight together for better pay, conditions and rights. We need clarity urgently and in reality we need more enforcement, not less.”\nThe treatment of textile workers in Leicester has been scrutinised in recent months, with a Low Pay Commission report, published in July 2022, labelling it as a ‘poisonous workplace culture’, where many workers are ‘vulnerable to exploitation… and unlikely to report abuses.’\nMs Webbe added: “We already know, for example, that illegal low pay is rife in Leicester, especially for those working in the garment industry, even with business regulations in place. At the very least, workers and decent employers need clarity about what the government intends to do, but what they really need is more, and more effective, protection.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_thank-you-jeremy/content_234.html": "Thank you, Jeremy\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\n”Jeremy has always insisted a better Britain and a better world is possible. That better future is socialism. Let’s make it happen”\nWe live in an age which requires Labour to keep being a party of big ideas and transformative policies, writes Claudia Webbe MP\nThis weekend Labour will announce its new leader to take over from my decades-long friend and comrade Jeremy Corbyn.\nWe should use this moment not only to express our gratitude to Jeremy for the amazing effort and campaigning work he has put in as leader – and indeed has done on so many important issues for decades and will no doubt continue to do so– but also to assess what kind of party we must be, and what principles and policies we must stand for going forward.\nIn key areas our party and policies have been transformed under Jeremy’s leadership. Not only have these restored our socialist principles, these changes are also essential to maintain and strengthen in terms of forging a path back to power.\nThe first is that Labour has become a firmly anti-austerity party, and one which is fully committed to giving economic and political power to the many not the few, putting people, health and the planet before private profit.\nThe need to fundamentally change the economic order – so it works for the 99 per cent rather than the billionaires and tax dodgers – couldn’t have been shown more sharply than during the current coronavirus crisis that we and so many other countries currently face.\nAs Jeremy has said, “the coronavirus crisis is highlighting the extent of our dependence on each other and the many ties of mutual aid that, woven together, make up the fabric of society. We can emerge from this crisis with that fabric strengthened – but it requires a recognition that we can no longer tolerate the inequality and insecurity that has left all of us weaker than we should have been in the face of this pandemic.”\nWe must remain fully committed to a fundamentally different kind of economic order to the Tories. A return to ‘austerity-lite’ politics would see us lose further support, as shown by what has happened to our sister parties in Europe that have gone down this road in recent years, including (but not limited to) in Greece and France. In contrast in Portugal, where they have attempted to chart a different way forward to austerity, our sister party has maintained stronger electoral support.\nA second significant and important change in our Party in recent years has been a firm commitment to anti-war internationalism, alongside standing up to racist scapegoating of migrants and others.\nApologising for the Iraq war was not only important to help restore faith in our Party to so many people who stopped supporting Labour due to that disastrous war and the lies that justified it, but also in terms of making it clear that we would think again before committing to more failed US-led military adventures in the future.\nWith Boris Johnson always keen to curry favour with the increasingly erratic and reactionary Trump Whitehouse, we must ensure that never again will Labour members have to join anti-war marches saying ‘not in our name’ against the line of our own party leadership.\nFinally, under Jeremy’s leadership we have not only seen Labour becoming proportionately one of the biggest political parties of its kind in Europe and the world, but also members again feel more connection and ownership over their party, with great steps forward made in democratising our party since 2015.\nTo win again, Labour must organise in every community — and on every day of the year — building trust in the idea that we can change Britain for the better, empowering people and communities. We simply can’t do this without both a massive and an empowered, motivated party membership, and that means being a members-led party with roots in our communities and workplaces.\nOver a number of years polling has shown that relevant, radical policies such as these – including expanding public ownership at home in areas such as rail, water and mail and ending our support for US-led illegal wars abroad – are popular with voters.\nAnd not only are they popular with voters, they are also more necessary than ever in these dangerous and unpredictable times, which also means they can become more popular in the future.\nThe same can also be said of our proposals for a Green Industrial Revolution, which address in a fundamental manner the climate emergency, which is a major crisis of our time for Britain and the world.\nTo rebuild Labour and to win the next election we need to remain committed to this transformative agenda, further developing it, and popularising it.\nWhen faced with ‘Trumpism’ around the world, progressive forces simply cannot win – or provide solutions to the major issues of the day – with the politics of vacuous centrism and triangulation.\nAnd here in Britain there can be no return to ‘business as usual’ after the extraordinary crisis we are living through due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nFurthermore, any suggestion of ‘shock therapy’ hard-line austerity to ‘reset’ the economy must be firmly resisted. After the amazing efforts and sacrifices we are seeing put in across every community and locality in Britain – and the drastic measures that have been taken in so many areas of our economy and society – people will rightly not accept a return to our NHS and other essential public services being starved of vital resources, soaring levels of poverty and inequality, a homelessness crisis on our streets or a refusal to treat our vital public servants decently when it comes to their pay and conditions.\nJeremy has always insisted a better Britain and a better world is possible. That better future is socialism. Let’s make it happen.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

PC Oliver Banfield remains an officer with West Midlands Police, despite admitting a charge of assault by beating.\n“This will only serve to further undermine trust in the police just days after their appalling policing of the peaceful vigil in memory of a woman allegedly murdered by a serving police officer. Nobody, least of all those who are entrusted to keep us safe, can be above the law.”\nBanfield, 25, was given a 14-week curfew banning him from leaving his house between 7pm and 7am, and must pay £500 compensation together with a £95 victim surcharge and £85 court costs.\nWest Midlands Police said Banfield was “removed from public-facing duties after the assault”, while a criminal investigation into the incident in Bidford-on-Avon was carried out by Warwickshire Police.\nHis employer force said that following the end of the criminal investigation, Banfield was immediately suspended pending the outcome of a disciplinary process into an allegation of gross misconduct against the officer.\nWest Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said it was “right that Oliver Banfield is now facing a gross misconduct investigation and has been suspended”.\nHe has asked the force’s chief constable, Sir David Thompson, to brief him “on the steps taken by West Midlands Police”.\nMeanwhile, the 37-year-old victim, hit out at Warwickshire Police’s initial handling of her complaint after she was attacked by a “drunk” Banfield while walking home at about 1am on July 26, last year.\nShe said that despite reporting the assault within hours of it happening, it took “more than 30 hours for an officer to take a telephone statement”, “nine days for an officer to come and see her” and “eight weeks for an officer to conduct house-to-house inquiries”.\nIn a victim impact statement issued through a relative, the victim said the effects of the assault had left her with “anxiety, insomnia and stress”, which had been “compounded by the slow response from Warwickshire Police”.\nThe force has since personally apologised to Mrs Homer stating its “initial response to the report of the assault was not as swift as it should have been”.\nThe victim added that when the Warwickshire force presented a case file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in September 2020, it was decided not to charge Banfield.\nHowever, aided by the Women’s Justice Centre, she had the CPS’s decision reviewed and the CPS charged Banfield in December.\nHe admitted assault by beating in court at Leamington Spa in January this year.\nDescribing the assault, his victim said: “I often ask myself if the impact of the attack would have been so severe if my assailant was not a police officer.\n“During the assault as I struggled to get to safety, I was sure this drunk man was fulfilling a violent cop movie fantasy.\n“To be verbally abused with misogynistic slang, grabbed by the neck, and forced to the floor on a dark road by a drunk man a foot taller than me is terrifying, but to then find that he was a police officer shook my belief system to its core.”\nShe added: “I considered myself a confident, relaxed, and independent wife and mother but since the attack I live with constant anxiety.\n“I have changed simple things like my route home, and I have had to ask my family not to discuss the case as it sends me into a panic attack – indeed whenever the subject is brought up I feel a rush of anxiety and a tightening at my throat.”\nClaudia Webbe MP said that Sarah Everard’s murder should have been a “watershed moment” in helping to end male violence against women, requiring action by all including the courts.\n“Violence against women is an epidemic,” she said. “In the UK, the conviction rate for domestic violence is 6.2 per cent- an appallingly low figure.\n“Particularly shocking given recent events is that Police officers and staff accused of domestic abuse are a third less likely to be convicted than the public, with a conviction rate of just 3.9 per cent.”\nMs Webbe added: “This violence has a trickle-down effect on the safety and wellbeing of women, who are forced to endure the constant threat of potential male violence.\n“From parks and bus stops to our local high streets, girls and young women across the UK are facing appalling harassment and abuse every day.\n“This spectre of violence blights the lives of girls and women, affecting their mental health, self-esteem, sense of safety and impinges on their right to equal access to public space.”\nThe MP believes that better protection for women against “unacceptable violence” from men was “long overdue”.\n“Given recent events, now is the time to unite the country and put in place long overdue protections for women against unacceptable violence, including action against domestic homicides, rape and street harassment – as well as tackling the misogynistic attitudes that underpin the abuse women face,” she said.\nCommenting on the case, Chief Superintendent Ben Smith, of Warwickshire Police, said the force recognised the “strength of feeling” on the issue following Sarah Everard’s tragic death and “understood the concerns relating to violence against women and girls”.\nHe acknowledged that the initial response to the report of the assault was “not as swift as it should have been” said an apology had been issued.\nWest Midlands District Crown Prosecutor Rachel Adams said: “The CPS takes violence against women and girls extremely seriously and will continue to robustly prosecute offences arising from this sort of behaviour.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

We are the city where our minorities make up the majority… we are richer for this vibrant exchange of cultures.”\n“At 34.3 per cent those who identify as Indian are now the largest ethnic group in Leicester.”\nThe MP highlighted the economic, health and racial inequalities in her constituency and condemned the British government for its record of austerity measures and policies which she said had hurt the community she serves.\nMs Webbe said the average weekly wage in Leicester East is £211 less than the national average, with the annual median wage at £20,300, among the lowest in the country.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-child-q-incident-fits-into-a-pattern-of-racial-inequality/content_617.html": "The ‘Child Q’ incident fits into a pattern of racial inequality\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nA 15-year-old girl who was strip-searched at school after being wrongly accused of possessing cannabis is an example of how black schoolchildren, university students and jobseekers are discriminated against, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nLAST WEEK, details of an abhorrent incident of misogynist and racist child abuse at the hands of the police was uncovered.\nIn 2020, the same year that the police murder of George Floyd sparked the inspiring, global Black Lives Matter movement, a black, female 15-year-old was invasively strip-searched by police officers from the Metropolitan Police Service at her Hackney school.\nThe official report into the incident, published by Jim Gamble QPM, independent child safeguarding commissioner, found that the search, which involved the exposure of Child Q’s intimate body parts, took place on school premises, without an appropriate adult present and with the knowledge that Child Q was menstruating.\nAfter the search, Child Q was forced to reuse her stained sanitary pad. Child Q’s mother was not notified in advance.\nThe search took place because the girl was accused of smelling like cannabis. Yet no drugs were found during either the strip-search or a search of the room in which Child Q had been waiting beforehand.\nThe official report concluded that “racism (whether deliberate or not) was likely to have been an influencing factor in the decision to undertake a strip-search.”\nThe report also found that the child had been subjected to “adultification” bias — where black and ethnic minority children are held to adult standards, but their white peers are less likely to be.\nChild Q was later allowed to return home where she disclosed the events to her mother.\nChild Q’s mother took her to the family GP who made a referral for psychological support and authorities later identified that Child Q had been exposed to a traumatic incident and had undoubtedly suffered harm.\nHer mother reports how her daughter has become despondent, uncommunicative, has stopped eating, suffers from panic attacks, that she is now self-harming and requires therapy.\nUnwarranted and malicious rumours abound in Child Q’s school that she is a drug dealer — a reputation purely due to this indefensible and damaging strip-search.\nA month before this awful incident, Child Q was accused by school staff of being “intoxicated,” although on contacting her mother, she explained that Child Q had been studying late the night before and it was this that accounted for her presentation. Child Q’s response to this traumatic incident is utterly heart-breaking.\nThe 15-year-old said that “someone walked into the school, where I was supposed to feel safe, took me away from the people who were supposed to protect me and stripped me naked, while on my period … On the top of preparing for the most important exams of my life.\n“I can’t go a single day without wanting to scream, shout, cry or just give up. I feel like I’m locked in a box and no-one can see or cares that I just want to go back to feeling safe again, my box is collapsing around me and no-one wants to help. I don’t know if I’m going to feel normal again.\n“I don’t know how long it will take to repair my box. But I do know this can’t happen to anyone, ever again. All the people that allowed this to happen need to be held responsible.\n“I need to know that the people who have done this to me can’t do it to anyone else ever again.”\nIt is important that all 14 recommendations of Gamble’s investigation into this incident are immediately adopted.\nYet it is even more vital that the racist and misogynistic attitudes underpinning Child Q’s ordeal are addressed, so that, to repeat the child’s own words, “The people who have done this to me can’t do it to anyone else ever again.”\nDuring 2020 to 2021, there were 299 “further searches” — the police euphemism for strip-searches — conducted in Hackney alone by local police officers from the central east basic command unit of the Metropolitan Police Service.\nAs Diane Abbott MP amplified in Parliament on Friday, 25 of these were children under the age of 18, most were black, only two of the 25 children who were strip-searched were white, 60 per cent were black and the rest were from other racialised groups.\nAccording to data obtained by a freedom of information request, 172,093 people were subjected to this degrading and traumatic treatment between 2016 and 2021 across Britain — including 9,088 young people between the age of 10 and 17.\nChild Q’s ordeal took place in the same part of London where the Met apologised in January and paid compensation to an academic, Dr Konstancja Duff, for “sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language” used by officers about her when she was strip-searched.\nTwo police officers were also jailed for sharing photographs of the bodies of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, two young black sisters from north London who went missing in June 2020, to a WhatsApp group including 41 police officers.\nThe police were also accused of showing a lack of interest in the fact that the two sisters were missing, which delayed their search.\nJust last month, the Metropolitan Police was forced to deny that the force is plagued by a culture of misogyny after an official report revealed shocking details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) report on behaviour at Charing Cross police station found a culture of toxic masculinity.\nThe IOPC said the behaviour was part of an offensive Met Police culture, not just rogue individuals.\n“We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’.”\nThis all comes, of course, after the brutal police crackdown of a vigil in the memory of Sarah Everard, a young woman kidnapped, raped and murdered by a serving police officer.\nThe institutional racism and misogyny in the police needs to be seriously addressed. So, too, does institutional racism in our schooling system.\nBecause while the case of Child Q exposes the degrading treatment of black girls and the mindset of those who look the other way, we should not assume this is a one-off; structural biases plague our educational system.\nA study by the think tank LKMco found that London teachers are biased against black Caribbean and white boys from poorer backgrounds.\nThe report found how unconscious prejudices affect the way black Caribbean boys are disciplined at school, how their work is assessed and the academic ability set that they are put in.\nBlack Caribbean boys’ attainment in London is 17 percentage points behind the London average for expected standards in reading, writing and maths by the end of primary school.\nRacial inequality is also endemic in school discipline. Government figures show that black Caribbean students are twice as likely as white students to be temporarily excluded from school and nearly three times more likely to be permanently excluded.\nResearch by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills found that black (African and African-Caribbean) A-level students had the lowest predicted-grade accuracy, with only 39 per cent of predicted grades accurate, while their white counterparts had the highest, at 53 per cent.\nTherefore, amid the coronavirus crisis, it is likely that the cancellation of A-levels and increased reliance on predicted grades will have a disproportionately negative impact on black students.\nThis form of discrimination extends to university and beyond. The National Union of Students found that, at a university level, 77 per cent of white students received a first or 2:1 compared with 62 per cent of African, Asian and ethnic minority students in England, while unemployment levels immediately after university were also higher among African, Asian and ethnic minority students.\nThe lesson from this grim incident is clear. We must all redouble our efforts to end the scourge of racism that plagues our police forces, our educational institutions and all aspects of our society.\nAs the Combahee River Collective puts it, “The cruel, often murderous, treatment we [black women and girls] receive, indicates how little value has been placed upon our lives during four centuries of bondage in the western hemisphere … The liberation of all oppressed peoples necessitates the destruction of the political-economic systems of capitalism and imperialism as well as patriarchy.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

The continued operation of the factories were widely believed to have contributed to high levels of Covid-19 infections in the city.\n“We cannot allow companies to get away with this predatory business model, in which corporate profits are prioritised above human rights and wellbeing,” Ms Webbe said.\nIn a letter to PM Boris Johnson, the MP calls for trade unions to be granted access to factories and workforces. Boohoo has repeatedly refused to engage with shopworkers’ union Usdaw.\nTUC Midlands regional secretary Lee Barron also called for law changes in response to the figures.\n“The government must use its much-delayed Employment Bill to make firms liable for abuses in their supply chains,” he said.\nMs Webbe added: “It must finally act to end the scourge of exploitation in Leicester, across the UK and around the world.”\nLabour Behind the Label’s Dominique Muller said: “The failings of the government approach to labour enforcement and health and safety alongside the failure of brands taking responsibility for the workers has led to a perfect storm of exploitative and dangerous working conditions.”\nThe campaign group, which first drew attention to the shocking ONS figures, said that brands, unions and government agencies must now work together “to create a binding set of obligations to protect those most vulnerable.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_liberations-womens-day-event-hears-from-india-iran-and-sudan/content_149.html": "Liberation’s Women’s Day event hears from India, Iran and Sudan\nAn international panel of women speakers called for solidarity with struggles for equality, freedom and justice at a meeting held by LIBERATION in Parliament on March 8\nCHAIRED by Baronness Christine Blower, Liberation’s International Women’s Day (IWD) rally heard from three panellists from Iran, India and Sudan, who delivered thought-provoking and moving addresses on the campaigns and struggles of women in their countries.\nAzar Sepehr, representing the Democratic Organisation of Iranian Women, one of the oldest and established women’s organisations in Iran and the wider region, founded in 1943, spoke passionately about the popular unrest and street protests in Iran.\nSparked by the brutal killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the so-called “morality police,” the protests have now been running for almost six months and, as in previous mass protests against the regime, the country’s women and girls are at the very forefront, Sepehr said.\n“Whether in the massive protests of 2009-10, 2017-18, 2019-20, or those of the last few months, the women have Iran have been absolutely integral — for which they have paid a very heavy price in the subsequent regime onslaughts,” stated Sepehr.\n“Many women activists have been forcibly disappeared or killed — or otherwise languish in prisons across Iran.”\nSepehr described how women protesters have been singled out by regime security forces for particular violence in the crackdowns, including the “calculated firing of pellet guns at their eyes, faces and sensitive areas.”\nThe speaker also referred to rape and sexual violence against women detainees being a commonplace occurrence in Iran and told a stunned audience how the battered and mutilated bodies of women protesters had been recovered in the days and weeks following their disappearances.\nSepehr also talked of the ominous spectre of gas attacks against girls’ schools, with 230 schools reporting such incidents across 25 of the country’s 31 provinces.\nMaking an urgent call for the support and solidarity of democratic, progressive, and pro-peace forces around the world for the popular, women-led, anti-dictatorship movement inside Iran, Sepehr concluded her address with a rousing cry of the core slogan of the country’s protest movement: “Women, life, freedom!”\nJoginder Bains, former general secretary of the Indian Workers Association (IWA), and a noted women’s rights and equality campaigner, told the audience that the main enemy of women is patriarchy and its associated structures — which exist universally, across borders and cannot be confined to any one country or society.\n“What is Indian patriarchy? There is no such thing. There is no patriarchy that is ‘Indian’ or ‘British’ or whatever. Patriarchy is patriarchy and functions to suppress and oppress women regardless of borders or nationality.”\nBains explained to the audience how the BJP government in India likes to portray itself as the saviour of women in India with slogans like “Beti bachao, beti padhao” (Save the daughter, educate the daughter).\nHowever, she said they reveal their true colours through attempts to reintroduce Manusmriti — a reactionary religious code containing explicitly anti-Dalit and anti-women passages.\nReferring to the controversial scenes upon the release from prison in August 2022 of 11 convicts serving life sentences for committing gang rape and murdering 14 members of one family during the Gujarat riots in 2002, Bains added: “The 11 were greeted from prison like heroes — they received flower garlands, their feet were touched as a mark of respect and confectionery was distributed in their honour amid a mood of celebration.”\n“The difference between the current Narendra Modi regime and those that have gone before is that this regime protects criminals. It promotes male chauvinism and violent vigilantism.\n“2.6 million girl children were killed between 2015 and 2021 in India — and the government’s own figures show that in 2018, 63 million women were estimated as ‘missing’ from the population,” stated Bains in a shocking reference to the extent of female infanticide in the country.\n“However, all is not doom and gloom,” said Bains, citing the major role of women in the demonstrations that followed the Nirbhaya gang-rape case in Delhi, the Shaheen Bagh sit-in and the Indian farmers’ protests, as just a few examples.\nAmeena al-Rashid, a Sudanese women’s activist, saluted the courageous women of the world for their unceasing struggle, not only against patriarchy but brutal dictatorships.\nRashid described how women had formed the backbone of the revolutionary movement in Sudan in December 2018 that went on to topple the 30-year-old military-Islamist dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir.\n“The Sudanese women marched in their thousands, day and night, for three long months and accounted for at least 70 per cent of those who took to the streets in Khartoum, Omdurman, al-Ubayyid, al-Fashir, and even in the country’s south.”\nThe speaker explained that the reason Sudanese women were so invested in the revolutionary movement owed to their experiences from the very outset of the Bashir dictatorship in 1989.\nSudanese women were soon banished by edict from the public sphere — forced to study a much narrower educational curriculum, subjected to arbitrary 7pm curfews, banned from driving and lashed in the streets if they dared to defy the authorities.\nSimilar to the situation in Iran, those women who continued to dissent would face abuse, rape and torture in regime prisons, or were forcibly disappeared.\nRashid described the enduring resolve of the Sudanese women to continue with the struggle following the military coup led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in October 2021.\n“While Sudan’s modern history is characterised by long periods of dictatorship punctured by short periods of democratic rule, we very much value those short periods because they serve to demonstrate the resolve of the Sudanese people for peace, freedom and justice in the country.”\nClaudia Webbe MP said how inspired she was by the three speakers and the struggles they represented and recalled the words of the renowned feminist activist Angela Davis: “I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I am changing the things I cannot accept.”\nWebbe also quoted Azza Qasem, the Palestinian women’s activist: “The occupation has stopped us from achieving real social change by imposing restrictions on our daily lives; it locks people into thinking only of their basic needs […] There is no free society without free women.”\nWebbe herself added: “That is why the struggles in Iran, Sudan and India are such important struggles and may we continue to move towards the day of liberation.”\nLiberation would like to put on record its gratitude to the three guest speakers for the valuable, timely and moving insights they provided regarding the struggle of women in their respective countries, as well as to all those — including several woman MPs — who attended and contributed to making the event on a great success.\nWe reiterate the urgent calls made by the speakers for considered and principled international solidarity with the popular movements they each represented — as well as the many others around the world in which women have a clearly pivotal role.\nLiberation recognises that it is women who are at the forefront of the struggles against imperialism and oppression, and for peace, human rights and social justice — leading by example and bearing the brunt of any setback. We are very glad to have been able to mark IWD together in this spirit.\nLiberation is an internationalist human rights organisation founded in 1954 as the Movement for Colonial Freedom — Liberationorg.co.uk.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-tories-shameful-silence-over-human-rights-abuses-in-sri-lanka/content_749.html": "The Tories’ shameful silence over human rights abuses in Sri Lanka\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nAs a former colonial power, the UK has a duty to act to protect the people of Sri Lanka says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nNearly twelve years since the end of the brutal civil war in Sri Lanka, almost no one has been held accountable for international crimes and alleged perpetrators continue to occupy key positions in the current government.\nThis impunity for past abuses is enabling ongoing violations.\nThe Sri Lankan government recently passed the 20th amendment to the constitution, which is a major challenge to democratic governance. The amendment, which has been opposed by civil society and religious leaders, removes almost all checks on the power of the executive president.\nIn January, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights released a damning report on Sri Lanka that draws attention to “clear early warning signs of a deteriorating human rights situation and a significantly heightened risk of future violations” and calls on the international community to take strong preventive action.\nAmong the early warning signals include the accelerating militarization of civilian governmental functions, the reversal of important constitutional safeguards, political obstruction of accountability, exclusionary rhetoric, intimidation of civil society, and the use of anti-terrorism laws.\nIndeed, Freedom from Torture has documented more than 300 cases of torture by the state since the end of the war in 2009, and the organisation continues to receive referrals for Sri Lankans who have been tortured. The report also documents a pattern of intensified surveillance and harassment of civil society organisations, human rights defenders and victims, and a shrinking space for independent media.\nTamil and Muslim minorities within Sri Lanka are being increasingly marginalized and excluded in statements about the national vision and Government policy. Divisive and discriminatory rhetoric from the highest State officials’ risks generating further polarization and violence. Sri Lanka’s Muslim community is increasingly scapegoated, both in the context of COVID-19 and in the wake of the Easter Sunday attacks of April 2019.\nThe issue which Sri Lankan residents of Leicester East have raised with me most are reports of the forced cremation of victims of COVID-19 – including those of Muslim and Christian faith for whom burial rituals and traditions are sacred. Enforced cremations contravene human rights and must never take place against the wishes of an individual or their loved ones.\nThe UK government must raise this with their Sri Lankan counterpart, especially given the fact that the World Health Organisation has issued guidance stating that the burial of those who died of Covid-19 poses no danger to public health.\nThe UK government’s draft resolution on Sri Lankan Human Rights for the UN Human Rights Council is far too weak and does not reflect the strong recommendations put forward by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UK must work with its international partners to strengthen the resolution and apply diplomatic pressure on the Sri Lankan government to abide by its human rights responsibilities.\nTo date, £6.3 million of UK taxpayer’s money has been spent on supporting security reform in Sri Lanka, yet this has only enabled the Sri Lankan security forces to advance more antagonistic activities, including the accelerated destruction of places of worship and cultural heritage.\nRather than financing this encroaching authoritarianism, the UK government must instead consider applying strategic conditionalities to aid and trade where they will incentivise the government to respect human rights and the rule of law and not cause harm to the general population.\nThe UK must also halt defence engagement with the Sri Lankan military and withdraw the resident Defence Advisor from Colombo as part of the process of holding the Sri Lankan military accountable for past and ongoing violations. The UK government must also consider which senior figures in Sri Lanka might warrant inclusion under the UK’s Global Sanctions Regime, which is designed to target individual human rights abusers with asset freezes and visa bans.\nAs has been the case with the struggle of the Indian farmers, the silence of the UK government over human rights violations in Sri Lanka has been unacceptable. Yet this is not surprising, as a recently leaked recording of Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab MP revealed him boasting that the UK intended to trade with countries with poor human rights records.\nThe UK government is anxious to improve relations with authoritarian regimes so that it can secure post-Brexit trade deals. However, I believe that international relationships must be deeper than just trade and must be based on the promotion of democracy, human rights and upholding international law.\nIt is alarming that this is the ‘Global Britain’ that was promised by the Prime Minister and his allies. A Britain which has alienated itself on the world stage by cosying up to authoritarian regimes, and which remains complicit in the suffering of millions across the globe.\nThe UK government must end this cowardice, and finally prioritise the needs, wellbeing and public safety of the Sri Lankan people above the interests of private profit.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-time-for-universal-free-broadband-for-all-has-come/content_857.html": "The time for universal free broadband for all has come\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe unions are right to flag up how during the pandemic the digital divide has left too many children with no access to schooling. We must stand with them, says CLAUDIA WEBBE\nI STAND in full solidarity with and support all trade unions who were demanding that all schools and colleges move immediately to online learning.\nWe on the left must learn from the demonisation of education unions in recent weeks and indeed throughout this pandemic. At times, it has been reminiscent of the brutal right-wing campaign against the miners’ union in the 1980s.\nAcross the country, the NEU, NASUWT, Unison, Unite and many other teaching unions have consistently stood up for children and working families.\nTeachers are some of the most underpaid and undervalued members of our society. We must resolve for them to receive a radically fairer offer of pay and working conditions both during the rest of this pandemic and as we rebuild from it.\nLet us be clear. Attacks on the labour movement are an attack on our working class. They are designed to break our spirit and crush our resolve to fight for a fairer world. Yet we must oppose these divide and rule attempts. Because when we stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.\nI will continue to campaign for all students, regardless of their background, to immediately receive the laptops, internet and data they require to participate in online working.\nI was proud to be elected on a manifesto that promised universal high-speed broadband, free at the point of use. Yet this was derided across the media, including on the BBC, as “broadband communism.”\nIn comparison, Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme — which was found to have contributed to the spread of the virus at a great cost to the taxpayer — was welcomed by the BBC with a graphic depicting Sunak as a superhero, here to rescue our economy. I hope that our public-sector broadcaster reflects on how it portrays policy announcements in future.\nNow, with students learning online, the need for everyone to have access to the internet and appropriate equipment has never been more important. Failure to do so will only compound racial, class and regional inequalities.\nDuring the pandemic the digital divide has left too many children with no access to schooling. Yet this was not inevitable. It was recently unearthed that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson turned down an offer from BT at the beginning of the pandemic to provide free or cheap broadband for thousands of disadvantaged families.\nThis shocking disregard for vulnerable children is the latest in a long line of the government’s cruel and incompetent errors.\nI have spoken to many head teachers in my community of Leicester East, whose students do not have the laptops or tablets necessary to access online learning. Indeed, my community provides an important case study of the inadequate rollout of digital equipment thus far.\nAccording to the government’s own statistics, the total number of devices allocated for disadvantaged children given to the entirety of Leicester City Council’s school district during the Covid-19 outbreak is just 1,781. This is barely enough for half of the 3,374 children in Leicester East alone who are eligible for free school meals.\nIn Leicester East, an estimated 7,026 school-age children were living in poverty before the coronavirus pandemic hit. As unemployment in our community has increased by 143 per cent since March — this is a figure that is likely to have got much worse. This means that there are five times more children living in poverty in Leicester East alone than there were digital learning devices allocated to the entire city of Leicester during this pandemic.\nSimply put, this is an inadequate level of resources, which has a damaging impact on young people in my community. Young people did not ask for this crisis or choose to grow up as it took hold. Their education must not suffer due to a lack of resources. The government must increase the digital and technological support available for all young people, especially those from disadvantaged communities.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of connectivity. Yet Britain’s digital infrastructure has faced 10 wasted years and has been undermined by 10 years of Conservative austerity and a complete lack of economic planning.\nThe UK ranks 35th out of 37 countries assessed by the OECD for the proportion of fibre in its total fixed broadband infrastructure. As of September 2019, only 10 per cent of UK properties had access to full-fibre connections.\nThe Good Things Foundation found that nearly two million households in the UK have been without internet access during lockdown and that more than 10m are dependent on pay-as-you-go internet access.\nThere are also estimated to be around 80,000 premises in the UK that are located in so-called “not spots” areas without mobile phone coverage.\nThe lack of a serious industrial strategy over the last decade has also hampered our ability to retrain workers and adapt to changes in the digital economy.\nThroughout this pandemic, we have seen workers who are either struggling or unable to adapt to new working online practices because they don’t have the necessary digital skills.\nIt is vital that the government works with trade unions to ensure that workers are provided access to digital training at this time of economic hardship.\nAs we build a greener economy, it is also vital that the government introduce full-fibre broadband free at the point of use. This would boost jobs, tackle regional inequality and improve quality of life as part of a mission to connect the country.\nThis could be paid for by properly taxing multinationals, including tech giants — who currently pay a negligible amount of tax.\nA report by Fair Tax Mark found that, for the “Silicon Six” of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft, the gap between the expected headline rates of tax and the cash taxes actually paid between 2010 and 2019 was £123 billion.\nAs Jeremy Corbyn has said: “With people expected to work from home, and children to learn from home, everyone must have access to broadband — the time for free broadband for all has come.”\nThis government’s failure to adapt our education system and our economy to the 21st century has meant that young, vulnerable and poorer people have been left on the wrong side of the digital divide.\nIt is vital that we tax digital monopolies and invest in connectivity so that everyone can access essential digital services as a human right.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_claudia-webbe-mp-appeals-to-reject-divide-and-rule-tactics/content_409.html": "A growing divide’: Leicester East faces potential loss of second Labour MP\nThe constituents of Leicester East have become accustomed to seeing their local MP in the news. Often for all the wrong reasons.\nThe former Labour MP Keith Vaz, who held the seat for 32 years, stepped down after he was caught offering to buy class A drugs for sex workers, and has subsequently been found to have bullied a parliamentary staffer.\nNow his successor, Claudia Webbe, elected in 2019, has been found guilty of harassment, including a threat to use acid against a female friend of a partner, and is facing calls to resign.\nDespite support for the former Jeremy Corbyn ally appearing to drain away on the party’s left and among constituents, no one is enthused by the idea of a byelection.\nWebbe, who will be sentenced on 4 November, has insisted upon her innocence and intends to appeal. But the likelihood of her being forced from office increased when she was warned that she could face prison. Under parliamentary rules, any custodial sentence that is not overturned will lead to a recall petition. If 10% of the electorate then vote for Webbe to be recalled, there will be a byelection.\n“I’m glad that it’s come to light, and it goes to show it doesn’t matter who you are or what position of power you’re in: harassment isn’t tolerated,” said Aman Singh Thind, 24, from his family’s online clothing retail business in the constituency. He thinks Webbe should step down.\n“Even if somebody else comes into her position, this has all just shown you can’t judge somebody by a few posters and pictures,” said a business owner on Green Lane Road who, like many in the area, was wary of giving her name. “Someone in that position has to be respectable; they’re working for the community. But as we’ve seen, it’s hard to judge someone’s character.”\nWebbe won her seat with a majority of 6,019, down from Vaz’s more than 22,000 two years earlier. The Conservatives’ vote share increased from 24.2% in 2017 to 38.6% last time. “Leicester has generally been quite Labour-heavy for years, but I think there’s a growing divide. I think Labour would probably stay in though,” said Thind.\nVaz, a former minister and Labour fixer, remains a party member and has many supporters among the local party and its constituents. His Labour opponents fear he may yet have a significant hand in choosing any future byelection candidate because of an obscure rule change at this year’s party conference.\nThe new rule, introduced by card vote 15, means byelection candidates will be chosen by a five-member panel, three of whom will be selected by the constituency party executive.\nOne local party source said: “It is well known that Keith and his allies have great influence over Leicester East CLP [constituency Labour party]. This rule change effectively allows them to choose the next Labour candidate, if, as expected, Claudia is forced out.”\nParty activists said half a dozen names of potential candidates had been raised locally, including Vaz himself, although last month he told the Guardian he would not stand again. Labour and Vaz have been approached for a comment.\nThe potential loss of a second Labour MP after serious allegations could encourage Tory supporters. Outside Webbe’s constituency office, 64-year-old Ellen Anderson said she would probably vote Conservative. “It wasn’t worth voting in Leicester when Keith Vaz was around; unless you were a Labour voter it was a waste of time. It’s different now,” she said.\nBernadette Martin, 60, said she voted Labour for the first time in 2019 because Vaz had finally left office.\nWebbe’s seat is on the outskirts of Leicester’s centre, home to many of the city’s garment factories. According to the 2011 census, two-thirds of the population were minority ethnic and 48.5% of people described themselves as Asian, a third of whom were Hindu.\nPoverty is the area is high, with 42% of children living below the poverty line. In the area to the west of Spinney Hill Park, this rises to 51%. “We’ve got to think about our kids’ futures. A lot of people around here still don’t get proper wages; where I used to work I never got a proper minimum wage,” said one woman, who asked to remain anonymous, as she sat in the park.\n“I think a lot of people voted Conservative [across the UK] thinking they’d do something good, but that hasn’t happened. I’ve got my mother-in-law living with me and she’s over 85, she’s always cold but I’m scared to turn the heating up as we have to pay the bills. We need someone who really understands what is happening to people in Leicester,” she said.\nSupport for Webbe among the left in Leicester’s Labour party is ebbing away. Helen Lentell, a local activist who campaigned for Webbe’s victory in 2019, said: “I feel solidarity with Claudia as a person and she has been a good MP. But I cannot support someone who can make threats like that against another woman.”",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_what-next-after-the-failure-of-cop26/content_955.html": "What next after the failure of Cop26?\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThere can be no excuses – we have to shut down the fossil fuel industry, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nDURING Cop26 in Glasgow, we have seen a festival of grandiose speeches and sweeping rhetoric from Western leaders warning of the cataclysmic threat posed by climate change and advocating urgent collective action.\nYet these empty promises have not been backed up with the binding commitments that are required.\nThe final agreement, which included a shameful watering down of the commitment to phase out coal production, was utterly inadequate to meet the climate crisis at the scale it demands.\nThis gap between rhetoric and action was encapsulated by the revelation that Boris Johnson, whose speech opened the conference, has allowed his Conservative Party to accept £1.5 million in donations linked to oil and gas since he became leader.\nThe government simply cannot be trusted to take the radical action necessary to combat the climate crisis.\nWe should be considering the nationalisation and winding-down of fossil fuel companies, not accepting their blood money in exchange for political favours.\nSince the Paris Agreement was reached in 2015, more evidence has been unearthed that shows breaching the 1.5°C threshold would lead to irreversible devastation.\nAccording to Carbon Brief, with 1.5°C of warming, global sea levels will rise by 48cm by the end of this century, compared to 56cm if we hit 2°C.\nEight cm may not sound like a lot, but it means all the difference for millions of people. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), every 10cm of sea-level rise affects up to another 10 million people around the world.\nThe Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports that hundreds of thousands of people are being displaced every year by floods in low-lying areas of Bangladesh.\nChristiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who oversaw the 2015 Paris summit, and Laurence Tubiana, the French diplomat who crafted the agreement, said that the targets agreed at the Cop26 summit are too weak to prevent disastrous levels of global heating.\nGlobal heating has already reached 1.1°C, and extreme weather is on the rise around the world. The IPCC found that emissions must be cut by 45 per cent by 2030 to stay within 1.5°C.\nCurrent national plans — known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) — would lead to 2.4°C of heating, according to analysis by Climate Action Tracker.\nThe overall plan of Cop26 is that countries are expected to return with better pledges in 2025, but we simply cannot keep kicking the can down the road. The climate crisis is already here. We have run out of road.\nIt is crucial that governments around the world — especially in wealthier countries — seize the once-in-a-generation opportunity presented by the need to rebuild in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic to rapidly decarbonise our economy through a green recovery. The ambition showed at Cop26 was in no way sufficient.\nThere has also been a concerted effort of Western countries, led by US President Joe Biden, to blame China and Russia for intransigence on climate commitments.\nIt goes without saying that every country, including China and Russia, must make protecting the planet the utmost priority.\nYet this blame game is not only counter-productive but is hypocritical and designed to deflect from the historic and current environmental damage wrought by the West.\nLeaders at Cop26 have refused to recognise the simple fact that the climate crisis is a symptom of capitalism and is therefore a class crisis.\nIt must be the big polluters and corporate giants that bear the costs, not ordinary people. As we rebuild a green world, we must bail out workers and the planet — not big polluters.\nWithout immediate government intervention, with a zero-carbon target date that aims for 2030, the urgent action required to preserve a habitable planet will be too slow.\nThis will cause unimaginable disruption and could cost millions of lives, most immediately and sharply in global South countries which have contributed the least to climate change.\nThe truth is that our global future is incompatible with the extractive, rampant form of capitalism that has enriched the ever shrinking few at the expense of the many — and our planet.\nThis was hammered home by a report released by Oxfam during Cop26, which found that the carbon footprints of the richest 1 per cent of people on Earth is set to be 30 times greater than the level compatible with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement in 2030.\nThe report, compiled by the Institute for European Environmental Policy and the Stockholm Environment Institute, found that by 2030 the poorest half of the global population are on track to still emit far below the 1.5°C-aligned level in 2030.\nSomeone in the richest 1 per cent would need to reduce their emissions by around 97 per cent compared with today to reach this level.\nThe richest 1 per cent ― fewer people than the population of Germany ― are expected to account for 16 per cent of total global emissions by 2030, up from 13 per cent in 1990 and 15 per cent in 2015.\nThe conclusions from this are clear. To tackle climate change we must abolish the lifestyles of the super-rich, eradicate extreme global inequality and rebuild a world based on equity and sustainability.\nIn the short term, it is also vital that wealthy countries — including Britain — write off debt for countries in the global South and allow them to prioritise their response to climate breakdown.\nThe pandemic has pushed poor countries into record levels of debt. The Jubilee Network found that countries were forced to spend $372 billion on servicing debt last year alone and that 34 of the world’s poorest countries are spending £21.4bn on debt payments a year compared with £3.9bn on measures to tackle the climate emergency.\nLow-income countries are responsible for less than 1 per cent of the world’s historic carbon emissions while rich countries like Britain industrialised and became prosperous on the back of vast emissions.\nThe average person in Britain emits more carbon in the first two weeks of the year than the average person does in a whole year in countries like Rwanda, Malawi, Ethiopia, Uganda, Madagascar, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\nMany African countries commonly pay more than 10 per cent interest on their borrowings while richer nations are paying just 1 per cent or less.\nThis is a direct consequence of the uneven power dynamics forged through centuries of violent, extractive colonialism and imperialism.\nBritain and other Western countries have a moral duty to ensure that economically poorer countries do not disproportionately suffer from the climate crisis due to the unjust hindrance of global debt.\nThis reveals the global inequalities, born from centuries of colonialism, that must be eradicated if we are to combat the climate crisis.\nBy 1921, the British empire ruled a population of between 470 and 570 million people, approximately one-quarter of the world’s population.\nIt covered about 14.3 million square miles, about a quarter of Earth’s total land area. This means that a large percentage of the world was subject to the extractive violence of British colonialism.\nThe time has long come for former empires to apologise for and take seriously the historical debt that they owe to the countries, communities and individuals who endured their cruelty.\nEmpire was an incredibly carbon-intensive endeavour, as Western countries rapidly industrialised in large part through the natural resources stolen from their colonies around the world.\nYet at Cop26, we have seen the leaders of these former empires gild their speeches with empty promises whilst condemning the countries they impoverished to deadly climate catastrophe.\nWe must demand an end to this historical injustice. We must ensure that the equivocating, the inadequate proposals, and the empty rhetoric is replaced by radical action.\nUltimately, we must recognise that our current economic model is entirely incompatible with a habitable future.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_why-is-the-oil-industry-allowed-to-dominate-cop28/content_339.html": "Why is the oil industry allowed to dominate Cop28?\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nCop28 must tear out ‘the poisoned root’ of the fossil fuel industry if it is to contribute to saving the planet, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP, as she bears witness to the execrable charade in the UAE\nAS I write this article, I am in Dubai, as one of the British Parliament’s non-voting delegates to the Cop28 UN climate change summit.\nCop28 has been called a “new Davos” where political deals to address climate change are “overshadowed by the business deals being made,” and as an event “led by bankers and lobbyists.”\nIn the week leading up to Cop28, the headlines were filled with accusations that the UAE was using its role as host “as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals” — a manoeuvre that UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned as a “serious breach” of standards.\nThis reality sums up one of the most fundamental issues with Cop28 and every Cop event that has taken place since it was inaugurated in 1995 — since the very beginning, Cop has been shaped by corporate interests and particularly by the very fossil fuel industry that sits at the heart of the climate crisis.\nThis year’s event, which is taking place in one of the world’s biggest oil-producing countries, is not only full of oil executives, it is run by one Dr Sultan al-Jaber the chief executive of Adnoc, the UAE’s national oil company.\nDr Jaber has not been reticent about his continuing enthusiasm for his industry. Early in the event — while the BBC reports that governments and fossil fuel companies are “going big” on ending the use of fossil fuels — reportedly, he had said publicly that there is “no science” underpinning the demands of climate activists for the phasing out of fossil fuels.\nThis conflict is woven through the very fabric of the event. Only last month, Guterres called fossil fuels the “poisoned root of the climate crisis” that is “racing our planet down a dead-end 3°Celsius temperature rise” and must be “torn out” to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5°C or less.\nAlthough 3°C may not sound like a huge rise to the uninitiated, for context the difference between the modern era and the last ice age that put Britain under hundreds of metres of ice is 5°C. A 3°C rise in a few decades will be a societal and humanitarian disaster.\nThe governments of low-lying island nations such as Kiribati are already attempting to arrange for their people to “migrate with dignity” as their homes disappear beneath rising seas. Parliamentarians from Africa and other developing nations, attending Cop28 have signed a document, at the conclusion of their climate parliament, recognising a major “emissions and implementation gap” and committing to push their governments harder, but they are a small minority of those present.\nLogically, oil and gas companies should be making decisions that will rescue the 1.5°C target, because the societal and geographical chaos that will result from not doing so will make their profits meaningless.\nBut in reality, they do not do so. Oil companies and intermediaries appear to be flying in, using Cop to make deals behind the scenes, while publicly on the international stage, pledges are made that are inadequate to begin with and then abandoned or ignored almost as quickly as they were made.\nAnd again, the Cop28 host illustrates a microcosm of this conflict and deficiency. In 2006, the Masdar City initiative was launched as part of Abu Dhabi’s “Vision 2030,” out of a subtle admission by the Emirates that their current oil-based economy was unsustainable.\nToday, 17 years later, only two square kilometres of the planned six have been built and its planned population of 50,000 is — at most — 6,000. The initial promises that it would be a zero carbon, zero waste city have been abandoned and replaced by “low carbon” and “low waste” aspirations.\nIn the same way, it can be argued that the pledges and plans of successive Cop events have never been implemented, with promised reductions in greenhouse emissions instead becoming rises.\nSo relentless has this failure been that in May the World Meteorological Organisation reported that there is a 66 per cent likelihood of exceeding the 1.5°C threshold in at least one year between now and 2027.\nJuly this year was, globally, the hottest month ever recorded, leading Guterres to state that “the era of global warming has ended, and the era of global boiling has arrived … climate change is here; it is terrifying, and it is just the beginning. It is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C … but only with dramatic, immediate climate action.”\nSeptember this year was then an astonishing 0.5°C hotter than the previous record for the month. Last weekend leading climate scientist Zeke Hausfather confirmed that last month was also the hottest November on record “by a wide margin” and was 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels. Hausfather has described the latest climate statistics as “absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.”\nBut instead of following the UN secretary-general’s call to rip out the “poisoned root” of fossil fuel interests, it can be argued, that the UN’s Cop28 is built around their interests with no sign that that this will change in future.\nSpeaking from the Cop28 platform on Monday, the president of the Environmental Defence Fund, an industry-linked body that has supported gas extraction even by fracking, lauded a charter to “decarbonise” the oil industry as “the single most impactful day of announcements from any Cop” in fighting global warming. The official Cop28 X account responded to this claim of a “clean” fossil fuel industry with: “We couldn’t have put it better ourselves.”\nIndividual national governments are no better, particularly that of Britain. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak continues to claim that Britain is a world leader in the fight against climate change, but has blatantly watered down British climate policies, delayed the ban on new fossil fuel vehicles by five years and granted a slew of new licences in British waters.\nNor will a change of government make a meaningful change to Britain’s climate vandalism. Opposition leader Keir Starmer has told Cop28 that Britain will “lead from the front” and “by example” on climate change, claiming that Britain will have 100 per cent “clean power” by 2030.\nYet while Starmer says he will not grant new exploration licences for the North Sea, he has also said that existing licences will continue. Experts estimate that undiscovered British oil reserves amount to around a billion barrels, with the vast majority in areas already licensed — and say that Starmer’s latest stance is actually a softening of Labour’s previous position on oil and gas extraction.\nGovernments and corporations have ample opportunity at Cop28 to make new oil and gas deals, but the space made for the actual climate movement is severely limited: for example, the Indigenous Peoples Pavilion where delegates can listen to those directly affected by the climate catastrophe and who are campaigning on such issues as the Landback Movement, for the return of land taken from them.\nThis small presence, among others, is one of the few reminders that the poor, particularly in developing nations, who contribute almost nothing to climate change are the primary victims of it. Their needs should be front and centre of all discussions at every Cop, but they are not.\nLast year’s Cop27 in Egypt agreed — despite much resistance — the principle of a “loss and damage” fund that would be available to poor nations to fight climate change and mitigate its effects on their people and environment.\nNothing was agreed, however, about how big the fund should be or who would actually fund it. That is supposed to be decided at Cop28 and campaigners have called for a fund of at least $25 billion, to be paid for by a levy on the oil industry. The media headlines reported that even far-right Italian premier Georgia Meloni had pledged €100 million, but it is a small drop in a very large bucket.\nA recent Climate Policy Initiative report calculated that African nations — not the whole developing world — needed at least $2.8 trillion over the next six years just to meet the continent’s commitments on emissions, let alone improve the situation faced by their peoples and ecosystems.\nThe prospects of Cop28 securing even the woefully inadequate sum of $25 billion from the embedded fossil fuel interests and lobbyists look slim. The prospects of reaching an agreement to keep fossil fuels in the ground look even slimmer.\nIf Cop28 and its successors are to make a meaningful impact on the global climate emergency, the excision of fossil fuel advocates from the whole event — and from much more than the event — is essential. Only if the oil and gas industry lobby is removed from influence over the decisions made to fight climate change will they be significant, let alone actual change implemented.\nAnd only then will adequate reparations and debt cancellations, paid for by the global North and their corporations, that a just transition to a low-carbon global economy without perpetuating poverty, be possible.\nIf Cop29 and onwards are to contribute to saving the planet from climate disaster, Guterres’s call to “tear out” the “poisoned root” of fossil fuels from our global economy and political system must be enacted without delay — and not just from an annual summit.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_neighbours-hopeful-over-changes-to-road-where-car-smashed-into-mums-house-leaving-her-seriously-injured/content_551.html": "Neighbours ‘hopeful’ over changes to road where car smashed into mum’s house leaving her seriously injured\nNeighbours launched a petition after the woman was left with life-changing injuries\nResidents who persistently campaigned for traffic calming measures where their neighbour’s house was smashed into by a speeding car say they are “hopeful” a new scheme will make their busy road safer. Neighbours in Hungarton Boulevard, in Netherhall, launched a petition last year – saying speeding had been an unresolved problem in the area – after the young mum was left with life-changing injuries as a result of the incident in April 2021.\nThe 33-year-old’s life changed “overnight” leaving her with injuries that continue to affect her today. She was initially told she might not survive the ordeal before having metal plates and screws inserted into her skull. Two people in the car were also seriously injured and the driver was later disqualified and fined after admitting to careless driving and driving without a licence.\nBut residents living nearby wanted to see more done to prevent it from happening again and eventually presented their petition to Leicester City Council last year in a “breakthrough moment”. After a “long battle” and various meetings between the council and residents, the council started work on a £190,000 speed-reduction scheme last Saturday.\nThe scheme includes the banning of overtaking, new electronic speed limit signs, increased waiting times at pedestrian crossings and renewed road markings. And although the changes do not include speed cameras, as campaigners initially hoped for, they say they are happy with the changes.\nRashid Thathyala, the brother-in-law of the woman who was severely injured, and who also lives in Hungarton Boulevard, said he feels the changes will have a positive impact. Speaking on behalf of his sister-in-law, he said while she continues to struggle with her recovery, due to a now weakened immune system, she feels better now something is changing.\nThe 50-year-old said: “It was a fear in her mind and her kids’ minds of ‘will it happen again?’ They still remember what happened, it’s still fresh in their memories but they’ve got some assurance now that something is happening.\nHe added: “It’s been a long battle but I’m grateful things are being done. Initially it was like we just hit a brick wall. Our first breakthrough was the council meeting.\n“We had a number of meetings afterwards to the point where we actually marked the points on the map where we thought the signs needed to be. The council really listened to us and we can see things happening.”\n“What we really wanted was a speed camera because that [could lead to] a penalty for those speeding. But I’m really thankful to the council for taking action,” he said. “They really explained to us what they could and couldn’t do because there were some legal limitations.”\nMr Thathyala said while the council was supportive, it was the neighbours who had to be credited with their campaigning. He said: “All the neighbours were really, really helpful with this. They were all incredible.\n“Our MP [Claudia Webbe] has been really helpful and supportive in this too. This will have a good impact once it’s done, I’m sure.”\nAnother neighbour, Moira Hampton, said without the petition, “nothing would have changed” but was “impressed” with the council’s response. The 62-year-old said: “You hear a lot of complaints about the council, especially in relation to traffic problems. But on this occasion, they’re doing the absolutely maximum they can on this.\n“I’m not an expert on road management but I have sat in meetings with Councillor Adam Clarke and I can see he’s really committed and he shows the human side of the council on this. I think they’ve done everything they can and they’re spending a lot of money and time on it. And if it’s not effective we’ll be starting again.”\nLynda Kaspruk, who has lived in the area since the 1980s, witnessed the incident in 2021 from her home across the road. Like others, she said she was happy work had “finally started”.\nShe said: “It shows that petitions can work because a lot of people think they don’t. People said at the beginning it was a waste of time.\n“What we’re going to do is monitor the improvements to see what impact they have. We’re being cautious at the moment. But what really matters now is how [the woman who was injured] feels.”\nThe roadworks are expected to last until the end of the week with Hungarton Boulevard closed off to all through traffic with it is completed. A number of diversions have been set up, with drivers urged to follow signage in the area.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_indian-farmers-assume-their-rightful-place-in-history/content_413.html": "Indian farmers assume their rightful place in history\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nFor now, India’s food and agricultural raw material sources are still with farmers. It’s going to take ongoing global solidarity to keep it that way, says CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHIS month marked one year of the farmers’ protest in India, which is one of the largest popular movements in human history.\nUnrest began in late November 2020 when over 250 million workers, including farmers, across India participated in a general strike in response to three new laws, established to advance the neoliberal agenda.\nThe contentious legislation was comprised of three Bills — the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce Act, the Farmers Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities Act.\nThe laws would have led to the privatisation and corporate takeover of the country’s agricultural sector and would have an adverse effect on India’s food security.\nYet after a year of inspiring protest and sustained peaceful pressure, the Indian farmers’ movement has been victorious in enabling both a climbdown by the Modi government and a setback for Western imperialism.\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was forced to announce a commitment to repeal the three agriculture laws that favoured private businesses at the expense of the growers they buy from.\nThis would have been yet another victory for extractive neoliberalism, yet it was beaten back by the solidarity and organised strength of the farmers.\nThis is a remarkable vindication of people power, after one of the largest protest movements in human history.\nThe farmers now assume their rightful place in history, along with the other most remarkable and successful radical, anti-capitalist protests that the world has ever seen.\nI have been proud to stand in solidarity with them throughout their struggle, despite — along with many supporters of the farmers’ cause — facing horrific, racist, misogynist and aggressive online abuse.\nYet the movement does not stop here.\nIndeed, thousands of Indian farmers held a rally in Lucknow last week, after Prime Minister Modi’s announcement, to maintain their victorious momentum and attempt to extract further much-needed concessions to protect their livelihoods.\nThe now-abandoned legislation would have removed government protections for farmers that have been in place for decades, including guaranteed minimum prices for crops. These must now be restored and protected.\nThe farmers’ protests are now calling on the Indian government to adopt the farmers’ other demands — including a “minimum support price for all farm produce.”\nThis proposal is based on a 2004 report when New Delhi appointed a commission under agricultural scientist Mankombu Sambasivan.\nDuring the Lucknow rally last week, trade union leaders made it clear that minimum support prices must be extended to all produce, not just rice and wheat.\nCurrently, the government mainly buys rice and wheat at minimum support prices or guaranteed prices, but the safety net benefits barely 6 per cent of India’s millions of farmers.\nAs Joginder Singh Ugrahan, a prominent farmers’ leader, told the Lucknow rally: “Our battle is only half won.”\nWe in the international community must stand with the farmers until the battle is fully won.\nBecause the underlying issues have not gone away. It is absolutely horrifying that India’s farming community averages 28 suicides a day — or 10,000 per year — due to the intolerable conditions facing the agricultural sector.\nThe National Crime Records Bureau of India found that over a quarter of a million Indian farmers have taken their own lives since 1995.\nIt would be my argument that this is unsustainable and cannot simply be allowed to continue. After this victory, the global community must continue to advocate for the wellbeing of Indian farmers.\nIt is also vital that the injustice and violence suffered by the farmers over the last year does not go unpunished.\nThe repression of this peaceful direct action has been appalling.\nProtesters have been killed, injured, and unjustly imprisoned.\nVideo footage demonstrates that police and violent mobs routinely assaulted peaceful protesters, destroying their living areas.\nProtesters in Delhi were surrounded by barricades and barbed wire, and had their internet, water and food supplies cut off; over 700 protesters have been killed, with many more injured or unjustly imprisoned.\nWomen and religious minorities were also disproportionately targeted. This must be a turning point for human rights in India, and the international community must play its part in holding the Indian government to account.\nOn this point, the failure of the British government to support the farmers’ struggle has been disgraceful.\nFor Britain to pride itself on being a world leader of democracy, we must lead the international community in holding the Indian government to account for its actions.\nYet this has far from been the case.\nI, and many others, raised this issue with the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, urging them to formally condemn the state violence.\nWe also encouraged the British government to speak with the Indian government about listening to the farmers’ concerns and engaging with them and their trade unions.\nI urged the British government to immediately cease the sale of weapons, including water cannon, tear gas and batons, which could be used against protesters in India.\nBritain has licensed £550 million worth of arms to India since May 2015. It is wrong for peaceful Indian protesters to be brutalised by equipment sold from Britain.\nIt was just as wrong for British companies to profit from the suffering of Indian farmers.\nThat’s why I also encouraged the British government to stop exports of pesticides banned in Britain to India and other countries, including Paraquat, which is responsible for thousands of farmer deaths in India — a situation so severe that doctors in India have resorted to hunger strikes demanding a ban on its usage.\nIt is vital that the British government does not finance the global spread of extractive neoliberalism.\nYet that is exactly what it has been doing. The Conceptual Framework on Agriculture and the UK-India Infrastructure Technical Co-operation Facility promote contract farming (one of the issues the farmers had been protesting about) and finances consultants to “alleviate bottlenecks to private-sector investment in agriculture” in India.\nThe British government must revise these deeply worrying international arrangements, especially given the clear display of opposition within India to the neoliberal policies that they promote.\nThe British government’s response was underpinned by the fact it is anxious to improve relations with India so that it can secure a post-Brexit trade deal.\nYet the Britain-India relationship must be deeper than just trade. It should be based on the promotion of democracy, human rights and upholding international law.\nIn future, the British government must take the side of people and justice — not authoritarians and potential trade partners.\nFor now, India’s food and agricultural raw material sources are still with farmers. It’s going to take ongoing global solidarity to keep it that way.\nThe legislation would have continued the inexorable spread of violent capitalism. The fact that it was stopped is a moment of inspiration for socialists across the world.\nAs a global progressive movement, we must continue the momentum from this remarkable victory and continue to oppose injustice and inequality wherever they appear.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

They published a report in 2021, arguing that structural racism does not exist.\nRunnymede, a charitable race equality think tank, said that the people involved in this commission “had no interest in genuinely discussing racism,” adding: “The least the commission could have done is acknowledge the very real suffering of black and minority ethnic communities here in the UK.”\nIt continues: “The very suggestion that government evidence confirms that institutional racism does not exist is frankly disturbing.”\nAccording to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 11 per cent of white people in work are in poverty, less than half those from African, Caribbean, Asian and other racialised groups at 24 per cent.\nRather than recognise the racial disparities, the government’s report seeks to pit working-class communities against each other.\nIn reality, in the sixth-richest country in the world, any level of poverty in is abhorrent — especially when we consider that personal wealth in the country is now over £15 trillion, which is heavily skewed at the top.\nThe richest 20 per cent in the country have 63 per cent of this wealth, while the lowest 20 per cent have 0.6 per cent of this wealth. This general trend of wealth distribution has never altered and is caused by policies that favour Britain’s ultra-rich.\nThe government’s own report obfuscates deep structural problems with our capitalist economy. The government message is to focus on growth, individualism and competition as solutions. Its message is clear: work harder, get ahead and “level up” yourself — and that no barriers, constraints or contradictions exist.\nGiven the scale and extent of inequality, hard work will never “level up” those in poverty. The government’s reliance on false empowerment is meant to hide the way capitalism creates poverty while denying class and racial inequality.\nWhen we look at our world today — a world in which half of global wealth belongs to the richest 1 per cent; a world in which global and regional inequalities are defined by racialised violence and extraction created by centuries of colonialism and imperialism — we see another historical epoch which remains defined in Marx’s language of the “oppressor and oppressed.”\nA thorough reading of black history unearths that the origins of racism and capitalism are intertwined. Racist ideas were carried from 15th-century Europe and developed by its merchants, slavers and colonisers.\nThe theory of white superiority was developed, initially to justify the enslavement of African people and continued to justify all the ways in which non-white people were exploited by white colonial powers for centuries.\nHand in hand with these developments and over the years, a whole body of “scientific” arguments was developed and used to justify the mass genocides by colonial powers.\nColonisation was, after all, a projection of power through cruelty, rationalised by pseudo-intellectual arguments about racial superiority and difference.\nBefore enslavement and colonialism, there was no global hegemony like we see today under capitalism. There is now a world owned and commoditised by class and a singular hegemony of capitalist culture, ideas and development to the detriment of all our ancient cultures, traditions and to our planet.\nAn economic system where a small class of people based on a historical legacy of theft and violent extraction own the means of production (that is land, resources, factories, properties and now patents, financial capital etc), which causes the vast accumulations of wealth and power.\nThe development of our Eurocentric economic system today and with it, its racism, inequality and climate change, is a direct result of enslavement, colonialism and imperialism.\nSo, when the British government focuses on presenting a narrative that calls on black people to pull themselves up, we need to critically examine what’s really going on.\nIn reality, there can be no levelling up without the dismantling of capitalism, imperialism and neoliberalism — and the delivery of reparations.\nCapitalism is haunted by the memory of every one of the millions and millions of African people, natives and indigenous peoples who were slaughtered, scalped, hanged, drowned, raped, tortured or died from exhaustion to make Britain’s wealth and hegemony.\nAll parts of the capitalist economy and every single one of its institutions are here today because of enslavement and colonialism and a continued global racialisation.\nWe cannot talk about the present without former empires engaging in a process of recognition, apologies, returning what was stolen and reparations for past atrocities. The brutal history of the British empire casts a long and enduring shadow on present-day global dynamics.\nIt is no accident that conditions like war and large-scale conflict, environmental pollution and malnutrition are concentrated in the global South.\nAs Dr Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana, said: “Racism is inseparable from capitalist economic development. For race is inextricably linked with class exploitation in a racist-capitalist power structure, capitalist exploitation and race oppression are complementary; the removal of one ensures the removal of the other.”\nThe underdevelopment of the global South to build wealth in the global North, erosion of workers’ wages, the cutting of taxes for the wealthy, the bankers’ bonuses, the mega-profits of energy companies and the trillions hidden in tax havens the government allows, are just some of the considerations of the systemic theft that would need to be addressed for reparative justice.\nTo move forward we need to build a better social order, where the costs for building a more equitable world do not bear down on the countries and people who are disadvantaged and have historically suffered from imperialism and colonialism and the manifestations of present-day greed.\nThe costs must be weighted to those former empires who have benefitted and are racially advantaged from past injustices.\nWe need to remake the world system. For example, the global North is responsible for 92 per cent of all excess global carbon dioxide emissions, but it’s the global South which suffers from climate breakdown and bears the brunt of the devastation, through such things as climate famine, droughts, floods, storms and sea level rises.\nThis is a straightforward case for reparations, including debt cancellation. The climate crisis arises from the same political history as racial injustice and presents a challenge of the same scale and scope.\nIn order to achieve justice, we need to transition from a deeply unjust and unethical system to the creation of a more just and equal world. The transformation we succeed or fail to make in the face of climate crisis will be decisive.\nReparations is a revolutionary process for justice and system change that can unite communities, struggles and movements. The movement for global racial justice requires no less a commitment.\nNow more than ever, it is vital that we on the left keep working with movements for justice across the world to dismantle systems of neocolonialism, global inequality and racism.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

It will take a lot more than another commission for people to trust Boris Johnson\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has shown that the time for empty commitments and heel-dragging is over. Urgent action is needed says Claudia Webbe MP\nBuried deep within a divisive, behind-a-paywall opinion piece, Boris Johnson has announced a new “cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality”.\nI am concerned that the prime minister’s vague announcement is simply a deflection aimed to placate weeks of protests and scrutiny of his government’s appalling record on equality. After all, last week it was reported that the Home Office is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission over its callous “hostile environment” immigration measures, that caused unlawful suffering for thousands of the Windrush generation.\nI am also wary that, by conflating racial discrimination with other kinds of “inequality”, the government is attempting to water down any findings that tackle racial inequality. Johnson did not help impressions that he is not taking this issue seriously by stating his ambition to end “the sense of victimisation” among Black communities. This is an outrageous, belittling way to talk about the very real systemic and structural racism that exists throughout our society.\nIt is abundantly clear that immediate action is needed, not another long-winded fact-finding mission. As the inspiring Black Lives Matter movement has demonstrated, we already know that severe racial disparities exist across all aspects of British life. Since 2015 alone, there have been more than 200 recommendations made in independent inquiries commissioned by government into racial inequality, with very few being implemented.\nTragically, the examples of institutional racism in the UK are endless.\nFor instance, it has been extremely concerning to see the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus upon African, Asian and minority ethnic communities. This was proven by the government’s own report – which they shamefully only published after repeated pressure – and which does not outline any action or protective measures.\nUneven health figures reflect severe racial disparities in our economy. The Resolution Foundation think tank estimate that African, Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi employees experience an annual pay penalty of £3.2bn.\nIn our criminal justice system, black people disproportionately suffer from the use of force by police in the UK, are more likely to be charged and are over-represented in the prison population.\nThe scourge of child hunger also has an uneven impact. As the inspiring Marcus Rashford highlighted, 45 per cent of children in African, Asian and minority ethnic groups are now in poverty. Yet the government has refused to change its cruel decision to cancel free school meals over the summer holiday.\nRather than stoking the flames of a racially charged, straw-man culture war around removing the statue of Winston Churchill – something that has not been proposed by the Black Lives Matter movement – the prime minister must act to end the severe racial inequalities that exist in the UK.\nGiven Johnson’s long history of comments – including describing African people as having “watermelon smiles” and that women in burqas looked like “bank robbers” – there remain legitimate concerns regarding his personal commitment to tackling racial inequalities.\nTo assuage these, he could begin by apologising for his use of such racist and insensitive language – something he has yet to do.\nThere is a litany of urgent actions that the prime minister could take to show that he is taking this issue seriously. He could implement the recommendations from the existing reviews. He could reform the UK’s racist criminal justice system. He could deliver justice for the victims of racial discrimination, including Grenfell Tower and the Windrush generation.\nHe could ensure that, when a black person dies in police custody – as they disproportionately do – the incident is thoroughly investigated, and the police involved face justice. He could transform our education system to teach the reality of colonialism, imperialism and the transatlantic slave trade. He could address the severe racial pay gap. He could end racist policies like no recourse to public funds and the hostile environment.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has shown that the time for empty commitments and heel-dragging is over. Now is the time for our leaders, in the UK and across the world, to meaningfully and immediately address the scourge of institutional racism.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

That they were ever put in the first place is nothing short of disgraceful.\nYet last Friday, I was at another picket line in Leicester — this time in the warm summer weather.\nYet despite the change in seasons, the urgency of combatting injustices facing workers remained the same.\nIn this case, workers with the support of University and College Union (UCU) were not on strike over fire-and-rehire measures — but instead against the appalling employment practices of the University of Leicester, which has embarked on a programme of forced redundancies.\nThe proposed compulsory redundancies across England’s universities including Leicester, Liverpool, Aston and Chester are very alarming.\nI have tabled an early day motion in Parliament which urges the government to end the marketisation of higher education; and encourage universities to work constructively with trade union representatives and protect higher education livelihoods across Britain.\nIt is not acceptable to enforce redundancies during such a volatile economic climate.\nMass job losses during the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes will carry an immense human cost.\nWorkers must not be thrown under the bus during this unprecedented global pandemic and financial crisis.\nThe fact that the University of Leicester has named this restructuring programme “Shaping for Excellence” is Orwellian in the extreme — as there is nothing excellent about Leicester residents losing their job during a pandemic.\nThe University of Leicester must reconsider these proposals, work constructively with trade union representatives and to do all it can to protect livelihoods.\nAll of us on the left must stand in full solidarity with UCU members and all university workers who feel threatened and undervalued by these changes.\nIn Leicester, and across Britain, university management must listen to the UCU’s reasonable demands and withdraw compulsory redundancies.\nThe problems facing the higher education sector are indicative of the corporatisation of universities over recent decades, which have been treated as private businesses and left at the mercy of market forces while top salaries soar and students pay more for less.\nTuition fees have trebled and maintenance grants have been scrapped, leaving the poorest graduates with an average debt of £57,000.\nEducation must be a universal right, not a costly privilege — because we all benefit from an educated society.\nLearning skills is not just vital to our economy — it lets people develop their talents, overcomes injustices and inequalities and helps us understand each other and form social bonds.\nThat’s why free-at-the-point-of-use education is the norm for most European countries.\nExtortionate tuition fees have been a failed experiment, which has saddled young people with debt, deterred working-class people from gaining a higher education and turned our universities into profit-seeking businesses.\nA 2017 study by UCL Institute of Education found that students from poorer backgrounds are deterred from applying to university due to fear of student loan debt.\nThe government must properly fund our universities, scrap tuition fees and cancel student debt.\nThe unprecedented economic impact of the coronavirus has laid bare the weakness of British labour protections.\nThe assault on workers’ rights during the pandemic is best understood as an extreme microcosm of the national and global decay of workers’ rights during the failed neoliberal project of the last 40 years.\nTrade unions are the best line of defence against workplace exploitation.\nYet the collective ability of workers to organise has been systematically eroded by decades of anti-trade union legislation — most notably the appalling 2016 Trade Union Act.\nThe latest Global Rights Index from the ITUC placed Britain among the worst violators of trade union rights in Europe.\nPoland, Hungary and Belarus are the only other European countries that were classified as committing “regular violations.”\nForty years ago, eight out of every 10 workers enjoyed terms and conditions negotiated by a trade union.\nToday, less than one in four workers have that benefit. Research by the TUC found that 3.7 million people — one in nine UK workers — are in insecure work, including people on zero-hours contracts and those in low-paid, often bogus, self-employment.\nThe government must take note of the recent Supreme Court victory of Uber drivers and introduce a single legal status of “worker” for everyone except those who are genuinely self-employed.\nZero-hours contracts must be eradicated, and hours should be regulated so that each worker gets guaranteed pay for a working week.\nThe 2016 Trade Union Act must be repealed, trade union autonomy and sectoral collective bargaining must be restored and the right to take industrial action — in accordance with international law — must be re-established.\nThe Tories and sections of big business believe that the mistreatment of workers is inevitable — that rights, fair pay and dignity in the workplace are an unacceptable cost to their bottom line.\nYet their free-market race to the bottom has normalised poverty, hopelessness and exploitation in our communities.\nThis class conflict requires nothing less than a workers’ movement to challenge and fight back against the organised power of business interests.\nIt has never been more important for us as socialists to join forces with our unions and fight for a society built around the principles of solidarity and in which all of us, regardless of our job, can live in dignity.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-tory-war-on-the-sick-disabled-and-chronically-ill/content_188.html": "The Tory war on the sick, disabled and chronically ill\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nRishi Sunak’s ‘clampdown on sick-note culture’ reflects the sickness of the ‘elites’ and the capitalist system they run, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nIT’S a shocking fact, not known nearly widely enough, that around half of disabled people claiming Employment and Support Allowance have attempted suicide at some point in their lives, and too many because of the government’s onerous work capability assessment (WCA) scheme.\nThe figure was 43 per cent seven years ago, according to NHS Digital’s Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, and, while no more up-to-date figures have since been published, the numbers will only have gone in the wrong direction as the government has pushed harder and harder to force claimants of out-of-work disability benefits into work.\nWhat is known, however, according to information presented to the Commons work and pensions select committee in 2022, is that over just a three-year period before then, the WCA had been linked to 600 suicides.\nWe also know that the government has, for years, ignored warnings from experts about the dangers of the WCA programme. The WCA has long been criticised by disability groups as a programme run by corporate “healthcare professionals” through which the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has hounded disabled people with constant and constantly changing physical assessments, even for those with incurable and deteriorating health conditions.\nAmong leading experts responsible for the study, Professor Ben Barr of the University of Liverpool had recommended to the DWP that it start to monitor the adverse impacts of the WCA programme — but, as reported, the DWP did not even bother to contact him and other experts to find out how it could do so.\nEven worse, the DWP actively covered up the data, withholding it from the professor the Cameron government had appointed to assess the “fairness and effectiveness” of the system.\nThis damning and terrifying reality appears to be mirrored among unemployment benefit claimants who the government sanctions for “failure” to perform some arbitrary work-related task or to scrabble hard enough for poverty-pay jobs. The emphasis here is on the word “appears,” because, in February of 2022, the government blocked access to data for Glasgow University academics who wanted to study whether benefit sanctions were driving up suicide rates.\nThis brought to an immediate halt the academics’ vital study that was already underway. Under then work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey, the DWP buried its own research and refused repeated requests — including Freedom of Information Act requests — for the data. Its excuse: a claim that the information was “sensitive” and, appallingly, that it was in the public interest to hide it!\nSince then, the government has aimed only to increase the number of sanctions imposed. Last April, a government report was published that noted that sanctions are not only ineffective but actually counterproductive. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt’s response was to announce that sanctions “will be applied more rigorously.”\nAdded to all of this is the DWP’s practice of making deductions from already inadequate universal credit payments. Nationally, according to DWP’s own data, almost half of all universal credit claimants suffer deductions from their payments, with around half of those being forced repayments of “advances” the government loans to claimants to cover the fact that the first five weeks or longer of their claim are unpaid.\nIn my constituency of Leicester East, where more than four out of 10 children are living in poverty, the amounts deducted are higher than the national average and the percentage affected will compound the suffering already faced.\nA survey by the TUC found that 86 per cent of universal credit claimants had been put into financial difficulty because of this mandatory waiting period. The survey was conducted in 2020, before the current cost-of-living crisis, which can only have made matters worse. This DWP practice causes “immense misery,” and forces many into debt and to rely on foodbanks, or simply to go hungry, with obvious impacts on physical and mental health.\nAnd now, Rishi Sunak has said that he plans to deprive doctors of the ability to sign those suffering poor mental or physical health off work, handing power instead to officials with no medical training, saying that instead he wants “work and health professionals” — the same kind of role that some have argued has ruined, and even ended, the lives of so many disabled people — to make sick notes harder to obtain.\nThis context demonstrates that there is no regard for whether people are actually fit to work. The pre-decided aim of this attack on so-called “sick-note culture” is to increase the number of people forced to work even if they are ill. The move comes at the same time as the government has axed a scheme to help disabled people find work — and is cutting benefits for sick and disabled people.\nArguably, Labour’s aims are not much different to those of the Tories. A month before Sunak made his speech, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves responded to a question about what she would have done differently compared to Hunt’s Spring Budget. Her answer? To say that she wants to get people off sickness benefit and into work.\nBlaming the poor for their own poverty and maintaining the capitalist stranglehold with the goal of ensuring that companies always have a large pool of people who will work for low pay will sadly justify the political reasoning.\nBy pushing a narrative that there are millions who should be working and aren’t — especially if they are supposedly hiding behind a sick note — the political elites foster an “us and them” mentality that impedes social and class cohesion and collective resistance. Reeves, remember, once said under then Labour leader Ed Miliband that she wanted Labour to be “tougher on benefits” than the Tories and not to be seen as the party for people who are out of work.\nThe British economy is also built, by design, on maintaining unemployment. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) aims to maintain a certain level of unemployment to limit inflation, by ensuring that workers are inhibited from being “too” ambitious in their wage demands, because they know that there is always someone willing to take their job and potentially for less than they are demanding.\nBut the level of unemployment (and of economic inactivity, which is a frequent media and political discussion topic) cannot be allowed to be a still pool, because if those not working can’t be forced into work and those in work can be confident of their jobs, then the unemployment rate — called by the MPC economists the “underlying” rate — doesn’t do its job of inhibiting wage demands.\nThe “right” kind of unemployment for capitalism has to “flow” — workers being made unemployed while those unemployed are forced back to work — or it doesn’t do its job. Recent MPC publications have expressed concern that the labour market is “tight,” without the required flow.\nMore directly, too, those forced into work they are not really fit to do — especially under penalty of sanctions — cannot be too demanding. They are intrinsically more likely to work for less — and we’ve all heard Tory MPs openly discussing the desirability of waiving even the minimum wage for disabled people to get them off disability benefits.\nSunak’s plan to deprive doctors of the right to sign sick people off work is the latest branch of a whole system specifically designed to make unemployment and disability a misery of poverty and stress — because for far too many people, even working is a misery of poverty and stress, and poverty and stress make people sick.\nFixing the system so it doesn’t make people sick and poor would rip out the foundation of exploitation and oppression that underpins the capitalist system, something the current political leadership could never countenance. So instead, they plan to make it far harder and more punitive for the victims of the fundamentally capitalism-diseased system.\nThe sick-note plan is not a response to the imagined “sick-note culture,” but yet another sign of the diseased nature of capitalism and the “elites” that run a society built on it — and, as ever, the victims of the disease are made to pay for the sickness inflicted on them. We have to build a genuine left, in politics and with our unions to combat and tackle this political sickness head-on.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

It is a miracle that nobody died from these unspeakable attacks. Nobody should be forced to endure such horrific attack, and I hope the unanimous guilty verdict of four attempted murder charges will bring some sense of closure and healing.”\nMs Webbe added: “I am particularly concerned that many of these attacks were made with a knife. “Knife and violent crime continues to rise, in Leicester and across the UK. Going forward, the government must declare knife crime an epidemic.\n“Crime thrives amid poverty and lack of opportunity, and we need serious investment, including increased support for mental health, in every community to stem the growth of and stop knife crime.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_rejecting-war-is-not-enough-racism-curdles-peace-2/content_590.html": "Peace and Justice Report\nRejecting war is not enough: racism curdles peace\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nAll conflicts and refugees should be treated equally — the uneven support for whites fleeing Ukraine highlights why formerly colonised peoples need to be critical of the Western camp and seek out their own peaceful path, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nWAR and racism have always been violently, tragically inseparable. For centuries, the most devastating and brutal conflicts in the world have been driven by destructive notions of racial superiority and murderous assertions of ethnic differences.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is abhorrent and deeply concerning. It is an unprovoked, unjustifiable outrage and a heinous violation of international law that will have long-lasting and tragic consequences. The Russian aggression, military bombardment and deployment of troops to Ukraine should end immediately.\nNo good can ever come from war and military escalation. As Globetrotter journalist Vijay Prashad said at the People’s Forum in February, “War is never good for the poor. War is never good for workers. War itself is a crime.”\nThe international community needs to redouble its efforts to find a diplomatic solution that ensures peace and protects the lives of people in Ukraine and in other countries afflicted by war.\nRacism and wars\nThe ubiquity of support for Ukraine, especially by Western states, holds up a mirror to show how, through the prism of racism, some conflicts, wars, and incidences of mass suffering are seen as more important and deserving of sympathy than others.\nThere have been numerous instances of journalists expressing shock that the appalling images of suffering from Ukraine are taking place in a European country with a majority white population.\nThis was expressed by NBC News London correspondent Kelly Cobiella, who said: “To put it bluntly, these are not refugees from Syria; these are refugees from neighbouring Ukraine… These are Christians; they’re white. They’re very similar [to us].”\nEchoing this explicit reference to race, Ukraine’s former deputy chief prosecutor David Sakvarelidze told the BBC: “It’s very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed.”\nIf we contrast this to the dehumanising language used to describe non-white refugees, asylum-seekers, and victims of war — such as former British prime minister David Cameron’s description of refugees as a “swarm” — a very worrying picture emerges about the inherent racism in how crises are reported, discussed, and responded to by the media, leaders, and the public across the world.\nThis othering of non-white, non-European people serves to diminish their suffering. We should oppose the unjustifiable trauma of people in Ukraine as vehemently as we do the suffering of victims of conflicts in Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries suffering from the evils of war.\nBritish media organisations and the government need to recognise that every theatre of conflict is deserving of both our solidarity and our compassion. The government should therefore provide safe passage and refuge for displaced people, refugees and asylum-seekers arriving from Ukraine as well as all other theatres of conflict across the globe.\nThe government’s ongoing hypocrisy is clear to see with the abhorrent Rwanda offshore processing plan and the anti-refugee Nationality and Borders Act of 2022, which provides for drastic changes in Britain’s asylum system. These policies should be scrapped immediately.\nLong tradition of non-alignment\nOn March 2, 2022, the United Nations held a vote on a motion condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was supported by 141 of the 193 member states, with just five states — Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and Syria — voting against it.\nTo understand why 35 states, which are overwhelmingly former colonies from the global South, abstained from voting on the motion, it is vital to consider the long tradition of nonalignment based on which these states are acting.\nThe Bandung Conference of 1955 is rightly considered one of the most important meetings in human history, as it was a hugely inspiring global gathering of formerly colonised people and was a strong assertion of Pan-Africanism and anti-imperialist solidarity.\nThe conference also helped to popularise the Non-Aligned Movement, which was an effort to counterbalance the rapid polarisation of the world during the Cold War, whereby two major powers formed blocs and embarked on a policy to pull the rest of the world into their orbits. One of these blocs was the pro-Soviet, communist bloc united under the Warsaw Pact, and the other was the pro-American, capitalist group of countries, many of which were members of Nato.\nMillions of civilians died during the proxy wars between the US and the Soviet Union in the second half of the 20th century and the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation hung like the sword of Damocles over the entire planet.\nNonalignment points us toward a safer, more peaceful future. In 1961, drawing on the principles agreed to at the Bandung Conference of 1955, the Non-Aligned Movement was formally established in Belgrade, then part of Yugoslavia.\nToday, the Non-Aligned Movement includes 120 countries, representing nearly two-thirds of the United Nations’ members, which are home to 55 per cent of the world’s population. Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana and a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, famously said, “We face neither East nor West; we face forward.”\nWhile the Non-Aligned Movement developed during the geopolitics of the cold war, it was founded and has endured on the recognition that no good can ever come from war and that violent conflicts, colonialism, and racism have always been closely intertwined. For instance, of the 35 countries that abstained from voting on March 2, 17 were African nations that for centuries suffered the violent extraction of colonialism.\nThe abstention was far from a reflection of support for Russia’s invasion. It was an assertion of pacifism made by countries that for centuries have lived under the abominable racist outcomes of colonial warfare.\nAcross the world, instances of appalling murder and violence at the hands of the British state have been erased from our present-day memory of the empire. The time has come for former colonial states to apologise for and take seriously the historical debt that they owe to the countries, communities and individuals who endured their cruelty.\nA revitalised Non-Aligned Movement, guided by the principles of pacifism, justice and international co-operation, could help rebalance the scales of global politics away from racist wars and toward a future of peace.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_pakistan-pays-the-price-for-our-greed/content_291.html": "Pakistan pays the price for our greed\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nPakistan should not have to pay the price for climate change. It is the global North and the big polluters that are responsible and which should pay reparations for the eco-destruction they have caused, argues CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nPAKISTAN is in the midst of a climate catastrophe and experiencing the worst floods in the country’s history.\nOne third of the country is under water, an area that according to some estimates is the size of Britain.\nBetween March and April this year, Pakistan experienced a record-breaking heat wave that saw several cities in Sindh province reach unprecedented high temperatures of up to 50°C. It had the hottest city on the planet, Jacobabad at 51°C in May 2022.\nMonths of record-breaking temperatures, including forest fires and melting glaciers have been followed by equally unprecedented levels of rainfall which brought an average of 190 per cent more rain than usual, leading to what Shehbaz Sharif, the country’s prime minister, has described as “the worst floods in Pakistan’s history.”\nAlthough Pakistan had witnessed more than 20 major floods between 1950 and 2012, the scale of the floods the country is currently enduring is unprecedented.\nAll four provinces of the country have been affected, with Sindh and Balochistan, which are normally arid or semi-arid, bearing the brunt of the worst effects of the floods.\nSouth Punjab and Sindh, which usually receive an average of 30 to 40mm rain a year, have experienced between 1,000mm and 1,500mm of rain over the past two months.\nWhole towns and cities have been submerged, and roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and other key infrastructure have been destroyed, cutting off communities and making it difficult for them to evacuate or receive aid.\nApproximately 33 million people, including three million children, have been affected, and over 1,500 people have died, among them, close to 500 children.\nThe floods have destroyed livelihoods, up to a million homes, and millions of acres of farmland, crops and livestock, leading to shortages of essential commodities, food insecurity and soaring food prices.\nIn the worst-affected parts of the country, people have been left stranded for weeks with little or no access to food, safe drinking water, shelter, medicine and sanitation.\nThe risk of waterborne diseases, and of infections like Covid-19 is rising as people crowd into what safe spaces they can find or in relief shelters.\nThe government of Pakistan estimates that the floods have caused more than £8.9 billion worth of damage, a figure that is likely to rise as the rains, the flooding and the mud and landslides continue.\nMuch more will be needed to reconstruct, support climate refugees, address unemployment, provide relief and tackle hyper-inflation.\nPakistan has 7,253 glaciers, the largest mass of glacial ice anywhere in the world apart from the North and South Poles.\nThe glaciers are melting, rising temperatures mean that by the year 2100, 36 per cent of glaciers along the Hindu Kush and Himalayan range that stretches from central and western Afghanistan into north-western Pakistan and far south-eastern Tajikistan, will have melted, which will have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan.\nPakistan is among the top 10 countries most vulnerable to extreme weather conditions brought about by climate change, yet it contributes less than 1 per cent to global greenhouse emissions.\nThe future of climate change is already in the here and now, in the global South. We are seeing the real-world impact of climate change play out with unbearable tragic consequences.\nPakistan should not have to pay the price for climate change. It is barely culpable for this crisis.\nThe global North and big polluters are responsible yet have been reluctant to end their reliance on fossil fuels and equally reluctant to finance the loss and damage suffered by global South countries.\nPakistan is carrying the full weight of countries and companies in the global North that are wreaking havoc on the planet through their reckless carbon consumption and unfettered greed.\nThe pledges and support packages that countries in the global North have announced in the wake of the disaster, are inadequate and do not go anywhere near the levels of support that Pakistan needs.\nSome of the support, like the £3.47bn coming from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the coming year, will have to be repaid and adds to the heavy debt burden the country is currently struggling under which, at present, stands at around £215.98bn.\nPakistan’s suffering cannot be separated from centuries of extractive colonialism and imperialism.\nAreas where the floods have hit the worst such as South Punjab, Balochistan and rural Sindh have been starved, exploited and poverty-stricken for years as the legacy of empire continued unabated.\nPakistan is forced to spend more on paying its international creditors than on the needs of its population. There can be no climate justice without debt justice.\nThe IMF loans that have a stranglehold over Pakistan have conditions which restrict Pakistan’s ability to prioritise support to its people.\nInstead, plunging Pakistan into a punishing programme of austerity, privatisation and higher taxation on its working-class communities.\nBefore the floods struck, the Pakistan government was already trying to appease and provide the IMF with assurances that it would impose enough hardship on the country’s population in return for release of loan payments.\nIt is wrong under the current circumstances where Pakistan needs to rebuild, reconstruct and rehabilitate for the IMF, the World Bank and other international players to demand the servicing of Pakistan’s debt. Pakistan is in no position to repay any debt obligations.\nWe should all join the call for climate reparations for Pakistan as loss and damage compensation for the global North-induced climate crisis. The movement for climate justice and debt relief must be supported.\nWe need a global climate tax so that the global rich can be made to pay for the climate and ecological damage they have been causing since the start of the Industrial Revolution.\nFossil fuel companies, aided and abetted by rich countries in the global North, are making trillions in profit every year from the extraction, sale and consumption of fossil fuels which are driving global warming. These obscene profits must end.\nPakistan should not have to bear the brunt of climate change. Countries in the global North must take ownership of the ecological crisis they have caused.\nLong promised investments by richer nations to enable global South countries to develop adaptions to climate change have been too little and too slow, and for too many countries they have been practically non-existent.\nIn comparison since 2015, the G20 nations have spent £2.9 trillion on subsidising fossil fuel industries. Shamelessly, the same rich countries significantly increased their spend every year to keep out the climate refugees they created, from entering their shores and borders.\nThe international community must unite to ensure the Pakistani people have the maximum resources possible to survive and thrive out of the catastrophe they were not even remotely responsible for.\nWe can no longer accept a society predicated on “climate apartheid,” where as Philip Alston, the then UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, warned in 2019, “the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_we-are-the-city-where-the-minorities-make-up-the-majority/content_716.html": "”We are the city where the minorities make up the majority” – Claudia Webbe’s maiden speech\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nFirst, I want to express my deep gratitude to the people of Leicester East for electing me to this place. It is truly an honour to represent the city where I was born and where I grew up — the city my parents made their home. Leicester, of course, is full of surprises. I mean, who would have imagined that it would become home to the most famous car park in the world, where the remains of King Richard III were found, and who would have imagined that Leicester City football club, ranked 5,000-1 outsiders, would be crowned premier league champions in 2016?\nLeicester is bursting with talent and inventiveness. We have the National Space Centre on the edge of my constituency, vibrant theatres and concert halls, and our world-famous Diwali festival on the Golden Mile. Leicester’s Attenborough arts centre is one of only five in the country to be purpose-built for disabled artists and audiences. You know, in any fish and chip shop across the country, you will find no better pie than Leicester’s Pukka Pie. There is no better cheese than Red Leicester, no better packet of crisps than Walkers, and no better vegetarian curry house than in my constituency of Leicester East.\nI would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Keith Vaz, the longest-serving British Asian MP, who represented Leicester East for 32 years. The 1987 election, when Keith Vaz was elected, was a watershed moment in the history of race relations in this country. There had been no black MPs for over half a century. Keith Vaz became only the third British Asian ever elected to this parliament. That election also brought to this House pioneering black MPs Paul Boateng, Bernie Grant and – my inspiration – my right hon. friend the member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, the first black woman ever elected to parliament.\nI am proud to be part of the parliament with the highest number of African, Asian and minority ethnic MPs ever. Over his long parliamentary career, Keith Vaz advanced the cause of representation and race equality while also holding major positions, including minister for Europe and, famously, chair of the home affairs committee. Keith is of course a passionate campaigner on the issue of diabetes. He also did truly important work in highlighting the UK’s involvement in what he rightly called the “forgotten war” in Yemen. Madam deputy speaker, I am sure you will join me in wishing Keith Vaz and his family well in his retirement from this House.\nAs a feminist, it is a privilege to be addressing this House as the first female MP for Leicester East. I am also proud to be the first British-born member of parliament of African descent from the beautiful Caribbean island of Nevis. My parents came from Nevis to the UK and, remarkably, given a Nevisian population of just 11,000, they met for the first time here. They settled in Leicester, where I was born, so Leicester of course runs through my veins.\nI am a daughter of the Windrush generation, and we must never forget the history of struggle of African, Caribbean and Asian people in this so-called United Kingdom, without whose blood, sweat, toil and tears there simply would be no kingdom and no form of modern prosperity. I have no doubt that my ancestors are here with me today. And I share the pain of their suffering because of the historical injustice of slavery and colonialism, but I also share their joy at the liberation that brings me to this place today. Throughout the centuries my foremothers argued for and suffered and died for the freedoms I enjoy here today in this place. With my presence in this House, Commonwealth history and the British empire cannot hide.\nWe cannot talk about the present without recognition, apology, returning what was stolen and reparations for the past. One fifth of the billionaires in Britain owe their wealth to the transportation of my ancestors, because they benefited from the compensation of the equivalent of £20bn in today’s value for the ‘human property’ they somehow lost at sea. It is to our shame that members of this House during the mid to late 1700s represented slave plantations, and let us not forget that British colonialism reduced India from holding 23% of the world economy to 4% by the time the British left.\nHow many in this House know or care about the British torture camps in 1950s Kenya, where members of the Kikuyu tribe were systematically tortured, starved, beaten, mistreated and raped? How many in this House know or care about the massacre committed by British colonial groups in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar massacre? And let us not forget that working people here from all over the Commonwealth died in their thousands in both world wars, only to see their descendants shackled and deported in the continued shame that is the hostile environment.\nMy father, along with his his identical twin brother, worked as an engineer’s hand at the former Wadkin factory on Green Lane in what is now my constituency of Leicester East, but those unionised factories, jobs and industries of the past were destroyed, along with Leicester’s manufacturing base, by Thatcherism in the pursuit of free-market capitalism.\nLeicester is considered the home to the garment industry. My mother was a home-worker, skilled as a dressmaker, a seamstress and an overlocker. But in Leicester’s garment industry today many workers, overwhelmingly women, earn well below the minimum wage — as little as £3 an hour in conditions that most people would find unthinkable in modern Britain. That is the legacy of Tory deindustrialisation, yet Leicester is the place where working women fought back. It was Asian women who went on strike for equal pay at Leicester’s Imperial Typewriter Company factory, and it was those women who led the way in equal pay, race equality, and employment. I pay tribute to them.\nI am incredibly proud that Leicester is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the UK. Our city’s identity is forged from a proud history of immigration from the Commonwealth and beyond. Over two thirds — 68% — of my constituents are from an African, Asian or minority ethnic background, and nearly half of our residents were born outside the UK. We are home to 240 faith groups across 14 different faiths and our residents hail from 50 countries across the globe.\nThis is what makes Leicester East so special. We are the city where the minorities make up the majority, and we are richer for this vibrant exchange of cultures. But racism and the far right have left an indelible stain on the history of my constituency. Enoch Powell’s racist “rivers of blood” speech in 1968 gave rise to the National Front and its message of hatred and intolerance across my constituency, but the history of Leicester’s anti-racist activists, campaigners and organisers who fought back against the rise of organised racism is a source of great pride and inspiration.\nIn April 1979, when the National Front organised a 1,000-strong rally in Leicester starting at Welford Road recreation ground, they were confronted by 2,000 anti-racist protestors who withstood police violence to send the message out loud and clear that racism shall not pass through Leicester. It was a turning point in the decline of the National Front. We even renamed Welford Road recreation ground: fittingly, we renamed it Nelson Mandela Park.\nThe right for different communities and cultures, and for people of all faiths and none, to live side-by-side has been won through generations of struggle. I do not take our unity and solidarity for granted. This government, a government for the super-rich, the oligarchs the tax dodgers, are still trying to divide our communities based on the colour of our skin, our religion or where we come from. I know only too well the hurt that my constituents feel when the government legitimise the dehumanisation and marginalisation of African, Caribbean, Asian and minority ethnic communities by deporting our people and embracing institutionalised racism, as was revealed by the Windrush scandal and the hostile environment. The continued detentions, deportations and charter flights are simply barbaric.\nIn communities like mine, this government have normalised hunger, poverty and hopelessness. It should be a national disgrace in the sixth richest country in the world for a single person to be without food, and for just one parent to have to choose between heating their home and feeding their children. Yet more and more families in my constituency are relying on food banks every year, and fuel poverty is growing. Nearly 40% of children in Leicester East are growing up in poverty. As the 1% increase their share of the national wealth, our regions are pulled further and further apart in terms of income inequality and life chances.\nLeicester was recently shown to be one of the most polluted cities in the UK. I vow to fight for clean air. I vow to fight for clean energy and climate justice, so that my constituents and people across the world, particularly the global south, can have a liveable future. It is vital that those responsible for climate chaos, the fossil fuel companies and big polluters, are not allowed to profit from climate breakdown, and instead pay their fair share so that future generations can inherit a habitable planet.\nI am proud of my party. I am proud of the leadership of my right hon. friend the member for Islington North in opposing austerity, opposing corporate power, tackling inequality and the climate emergency, and for having rewritten the terms of political debate. Madam deputy speaker, I stand before you today in the lineage of people who fought to keep our culture and traditions alive, and to keep the shackles off our feet. I come from a people who survived: survived the evils of slavery. Today, and every day, I am grateful that they never gave up. I vow that as Leicester East’s new MP, I too will never give up. I will work hard to protect all my constituents and fight against those who wish to pit our communities against each another.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_profile-1/content_15.html": "Claudia was born in Leicester. One of four children, she was brought up by her Nevisian parents (from the twin islands of St Kitts and Nevis), who were part of the Windrush Generation. Her father was an engineer’s hand (employed at the Wadkin manufacturing company on Green Lane, LE5), and her mother was a dressmaker.\nClaudia joined her first Trade Union at age 16, the Community and Youth Workers Union, which is now part of Unite the Union. While studying full-time, she worked as a silver service waitress and part-time youth worker and fought to defend the rights of casual and seasonal workers.\nClaudia is passionate about communities, children, and young people. Her passion for confronting poverty, inequalities, workers’ rights, and injustice is unquestionable and drives her passion daily.\nClaudia attended Gateway Sixth Form College in Leicester and then studied Mathematics, Statistics, and Computers at University before embarking on a Social Science programme and then a Master’s in Race and Ethnic Relations. In Nottingham, she became a ‘principal training officer’ and led a team delivering the Home Office Joint Investigation of Child Sexual Abuse Training and new legislation on the Children Act 1989. She worked closely with both the police and ‘social services’.\nClaudia has run several children’s charities and centres for work with young people and communities. She specialised in detached youth and community work, engaging and working with young people in non-conventional settings and street work. She developed her work and career in Leicester, Coventry, Birmingham, Nottingham, Leeds, Reading, Bath, North-East Somerset and London leading, developing and running a range of initiatives, centres and change organisations in the public and charitable sector.\nShe has run several equality rights organisations, including the Bath and North East Somerset Race Equality Council, located in the City of Bath and the Westminster Race Equality Council, which was located at Piccadilly Circus London. Arguably at the time, the most central race equality council in the country, giving her unparalleled access to some of the most powerful and largest institutions in both the public and private sector including the Metropolitan Police Service and New Scotland Yard.\nShe founded with others Operation Trident to tackle the disproportionate impact of gun murders on Black communities.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_coronavirus-leicester-should-be-locked-down-to-stop-covid-19-surge/content_254.html": "Coronavirus: Leicester ‘should be locked down to stop Covid-19 surge\nLocal MP says lockdown necessary to protect lives due to the context of ”significant levels of African and Asian minority ethnic communities” and ”significant levels of poverty”\nLeicester should be locked down to protect the city from coronavirus after another 866 cases were recorded in the past two weeks, a local MP has warned.\nLabour’s Claudia Webbe said the lockdown was particularly needed to protect lives as the city had “significant levels of African and Asian minority ethnic communities” and “significant levels of poverty”\nThe Leicester East MP told the BBC: “There are significant worries and significant problems in terms of inequalities and high levels of poverty that I’m concerned about. That is the context in which this Covid-19 is operating in. So I’m very concerned, and I really do believe that where the data allows we need to ensure that we engage in processes to protect lives, and I think we need to go into therefore more localised lockdown to protect lives and ensure that we can address this virus\n“The Government hasn’t reassured us. Thus far, the messages and the communication from the Government have been unclear, and it has been difficult, and I really don’t understand what communities are meant to follow.”\nExtend restrictions\nFive schools in Leicester have shut since reopening on 1 June because of coronavirus outbreaks, and there have been reports of further outbreaks at a Sainsbury’s supermarket and at a large sandwich production factory.\nOfficials have suggested keeping the current lockdown restrictions in place in Leicester for two weeks past July 4 to control the coronavirus outbreak, according to the city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby.\nDelivering a series of criticisms of the information he has received, the Labour mayor said: “Frankly it’s been intensely frustrating. It was only last Thursday that we finally got some of the data we need but we’re still not getting all of it and it was only at 1.04am that the recommendations for Leicester arrived in my inbox.\n“What they’re suggesting is not a return to lockdown, it seems that what they’re suggesting is that we continue the present level of restriction for a further two weeks beyond July 4.\n“I’ve looked at this report and frankly it’s obviously been cobbled together very hastily. It’s superficial and its description of Leicester is inaccurate and certainly it does not provide us with the information we need if we are to remain restricted for two weeks longer than the rest of the country.”\nMs Webbe said the Government’s lifting of lockdown restrictions on July 4 while her constituency was seeing a new spike in cases would be ”reckless”\nShe said countrywide lockdown measures introduced in late March should be re-introduced in Leicester, such as asking people to stay in their homes as much as possible and the two-metre social distancing restriction.\n“We’re talking about a situation where we need a lockdown, but on July 4, almost a week on, we’re talking about the easing of lockdown”, she said. “I think this is reckless when you’ve got a situation in Leicester where 25 per cent of the cases (in the city) have happened in the last two weeks.”\nLack of information\nLeicester public health director Ivan Browne was also critical about the level of information given to the city to tackle the outbreak, which he said is concentrated around the younger working-age population and predominately towards the east part of the city.\nHe said: “I don’t think at the moment we’re seeing a single cause or a single smoking gun on this so we need really try to dig down and find out what is going on and it’s likely to be a combination of factors. Information has been challenging all the way through this.\n“It has definitely been challenging and I think as director of public health we have really been pushing for some time to ask for as complete a data set as possible because that’s how we can really effectively start to challenge these things on the ground.”\nMobile testing units have been rushed into the city to combat the surge in Covid-19 cases and Health Secretary Matt Hancock will hold a conference call on Monday with local leaders to discuss next steps. As well as extending the current lockdown restrictions beyond July 4, other measures being considered are closing non-essential shops and shutting down public transport to a skeleton service.\nOn Sunday, Home Secretary Priti Patel, in interviews with broadcasters, appeared to confirm Leicester would be locked down. But Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health secretary and Leicester South MP, said Ms Patel had “got slightly in a muddle” about a possible lockdown.\nHe said he had spoken to Mr Hancock, adding: “I don’t believe a local lockdown in Leicester is about to be proposed.” The Department of Health and Social Care has said it is supporting officials in the city to manage the outbreak.\nThis story has been updated to clarify that the comments by Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe did not imply that population was a contributory factor to the outbreak, but rather that the demographics of the population meant they had a higher level of vulnerability to outbreaks of the virus. We apologise to Claudia Webbe for the earlier inaccuracy.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_stop-arming-israel-we-need-an-international-arms-embargo-now/content_316.html": "Stop arming Israel – we need an international arms embargo now\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe must not turn a blind eye to Britain’s complicity in the suffering of the Palestinian people through its billion-pound weapons deals with some of the most oppressive governments in the world, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nWEAPONS sold from Britain to Israel are being used in Israel’s “plausible genocide” of the Palestinian people. This direct involvement not only implicates Britain in Israel’s war crimes in Gaza, but also exposes the British government’s collusion and complicity in cutting funds to the UN relief agency for Palestine, UNRWA.\nBy doing so they have put over two million civilians in Gaza at risk of rapid starvation and disease.\nFurthermore, the British government’s actions extend beyond direct involvement. It is providing political and public relations cover and undermining ceasefire initiatives at the United Nations security council. Its abstentions, alongside the US veto, only serve to perpetuate the suffering and injustice inflicted upon the Palestinian people\nThe British government has licensed arms to Israel throughout its illegal and brutal occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and during at least five Israeli military offensives against the Palestinian people. These assaults killed thousands, long before October 7 2023.\nAccording to Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, around 35,000 Palestinian civilians — mostly women and children — have been killed by Israel since October 7, with double that amount wounded, many of them suffering life-changing injuries, including amputations without anaesthetics.\nBritish arms exports have continued even after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) put Israel formally on trial for genocide, while Israel has continued to slaughter thousands more despite being ordered by the court to do everything in its power to protect Palestinian lives.\nAnd these are not just historic licences simply continuing. As I pointed out in the House of Commons chamber last week, at the very least Britain has issued 27 new weapons export licences to Israel since October 7.\nAccording to documents revealed in court cases, there are more than another 480 licences waiting to be approved by the government. There is no internal scrutiny; Parliament’s committee on arms export control, which had comprised of representatives from the international trade select committee, the defence committee, the foreign affairs select committee, and the international development committee, has quietly disappeared and ceases to exist.\nThe Campaign Against Arms Trade was unequivocal in calling on the government to immediately revoke all licences for arms exports to Israel, as it states: “It is not credible that the UK government or the leader of the opposition believe that the siege, bombardments and forcible transfer of civilians of Gaza are compliant with international law.”\nThis week, the UN issued a statement calling on all nations licensing arms to Israel to cease with immediate effect. In their statement they made clear that “any transfer of weapons or ammunition to Israel that would be used in Gaza is likely to violate international humanitarian law and must cease immediately.”\nIsrael’s continued massacre of Palestinian civilians since the ICJ ruling has not led even to the slightest pause on the part of the British government.\nIn her response last month to a legal attempt by the Global Legal Action Network (Glan) on behalf of Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq to force the government to end arms exports to Israel, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch said Britain had conducted no fewer than four “risk assessments” of continuing weapons exports.\nAs part of these assessments, the Foreign Office wrote to the Israeli government with a list of issues, including the bombing of the al-Shifa hospital, missile strikes on ambulances and aid convoys, the air strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp, the forced transfer of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the north of Gaza to the south and Israel’s blockade of food, fuel and medicines, and the collective punishment that the blockade and military assault constitute.\nIsrael, in response, declined to address any of these specifics, not even to attempt to justify its starvation blockade, instead simply insisting it was acting in line with international law.\nDespite this lack of any substantive response, the Secretary of State decided to take Israel’s word for it, telling the court that Israel takes a “different view” of its obligations under international law. To add insult to injury, she even asked the court to award full costs against Al-Haq because their legal action was “not a matter of general public importance.”\nBadenoch also declined to engage with points raised by Bindmans, the lawyers acting for Al-Haq and Glan, about whether Britain has sold white phosphorus — which Amnesty International has confirmed Israel is using illegally against the Palestinian population — or any of the United Nations bodies in their condemnation of Israel’s assault and blockade.\nEven after the ICJ ruling last month and its examination of the allegation that Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior Israeli government figures had used genocidal language toward the Palestinians, Britain has done nothing to restrict arms exports to Israel.\nThe genocidal language could hardly have been clearer. Netanyahu promised to “turn Gaza into a deserted island” and compared the Palestinians to “Amalek,” the Biblical nation wiped out by the Israelites down to the last farm animal. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced “a complete siege on the Gaza Strip [with] no electricity, no food, no fuel” because, he said, “we are fighting human animals” and “we will eliminate everything.”\nIn response, the British government has said only that it might restrict “some” types of weapons if Israel goes ahead with its ground invasion of Rafah, the tiny enclave into which most Palestinians in Gaza have been driven, an invasion expected to cause a humanitarian disaster for the refugees there.\nBut Israel’s daily, deadly, bombing of Rafah, killing whole families and again targeting medical facilities and even the offices of Belgium’s aid agency, was not enough to move Britain even to threaten action, let alone take it.\nIn cold financial terms, it’s not hard to see why the government is determined to keep arms exports flowing. The British arms and weapons industry provides around a sixth of the components of the F-35 stealth combat aircraft that are bombing Gaza — a contract worth an estimated £336 million so far in the past eight years.\nIn four years up to 2022, Britain sold almost £150m in arms sales via “single issue export licences,” but most weapons are sold under the open-ended “open general export licences,” which hide sales values and allow unlimited ongoing sales with no government scrutiny. The F-35 components are covered by such an “open” licence and Israel has taken delivery of at least 36 of these plans, with at least another 14 scheduled.\nIt is argued that many of these arms manufacturers make huge donations to the Conservative Party, with Christopher Harborne, the largest shareholder of weapons firm QinetiQ, making several donations including a single gift of a million pounds to Boris Johnson as PM. Reportedly arms firms were also prominent at last October’s Tory Party conference.\nThese allegations also extend to the official “opposition,” the Labour Party as being close to the arms industry. As Open Democracy pointed out, Labour’s conference featured at least two firms, Boeing and Babcock, as well as software firm Palantir, which provides intelligence and surveillance services to Israel; there are media reports which claim that Keir Starmer and colleagues have also accepted hospitality and free sports tickets from weapons firms.\nThe issue of British arms export to countries where human rights abuses are present, do not just apply to Israel, of course. Britain has sold around £2.3 billion worth of arms to India in the past decade-and-a-half and continues to do so, despite arms being used against peacefully protesting Indian farmers in 2020/21 and again now in 2024. Sales “surged” in 2022, according to Action on Armed Violence.\nBritain has issued licences annually for weapon sales to Sudan, during a period in which civil war killed almost 400,000 through violence and famine. Forty-three limited and unlimited British arms export licences were granted to the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2012 and 2022, despite six million killed in civil wars there, since 1996. And in 2019, a UN report condemned the British government after its arms sales to oppressive regimes that killed 12,000 children in the space of a year, including £5.3bn to Saudi Arabia for its war on Yemen.\nBut when Israel has given notice of its intent to break international law, Britain has continued and even accelerated its exports of weapons and weapon components and has provided political cover while Israel has killed tens of thousands of civilians and is bombing and starving two million more.\nSuch collusion and complicity have reinforced and emboldened Israel’s sense of impunity in its war crimes against Palestinian civilians.\nIt is a grave injustice that Britain, a nation that prides itself on upholding human rights and justice, is actively participating in such reprehensible actions. The world must not turn a blind eye to this complicity and must hold Britain accountable for its role in perpetuating the suffering of the Palestinian people.\nBritain must end its arms exports to Israel and to every oppressive regime immediately. We need an international arms embargo against Israel. Worldwide the message is clear: stop arming Israel.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

No wonder workers are at risk of Covid-19, says Claudia Webbe MP\nWHEN I was elected as member of Parliament for Leicester East, ending workplace exploitation was — and remains — one of my most important priorities.\nLeicester has the largest number of garment workers in the UK. There are an estimated 1,500 garment manufacturing businesses in the city, employing around 10,000 people, the majority of whom are women from migrant communities.\nA recent study by HM Revenue and Customs found that, over a six-year period, a quarter of all UK textile factories caught failing to pay the minimum wage were based in Leicester, with some textile factories reportedly offering less than £3.50 an hour.\nThis has been an “open secret” for far too long and has been brought to official attention over many years.\nInstead of dealing with the issue, the government introduced austerity, underfunded the Health and Safety Executive and allowed zero-hours contracts and poor pay to flourish while rejecting every single recommendation from a select committee report that could have addressed the problem.\nThe tabloids, meanwhile, were demonising migrants. It is this combined power of the political elite, media and big business that has created and sustained this disaster capitalism where the working class, including migrant communities, become collateral damage.\nIt is important to understand the conditions that led us to this position and situation in Leicester.\nAn online shopping boom and unsafe, cramped working conditions with a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) have created a perfect storm for Covid-19 transmission rates to rise.\nI have been contacted by many workers in Leicester East regarding several Leicester garment manufacturers which, it is claimed, are operating unethically, paying poverty wages and without due regard to health and safety.\nMany of the workers who approached me for help have an immigration status of no recourse to public funds (NRPF), are ineligible to access statutory sick pay and are employed by firms that have no union recognition and where health and safety measures have not been implemented.\nLeicester is home to many undocumented workers with NRPF, for whom it is impossible to survive without attending work, often in unsafe conditions.\nThis crisis has demonstrated the need for unionised, accountable workplaces that prioritise employee wellbeing.\nAll workplaces must adhere to health and safety measures, and nobody in Leicester or elsewhere in Britain should be forced to work in unsafe conditions.\nThe government must ensure that everyone, regardless of their immigration status, can afford to stay safe during the continued lockdown.\nLeicester’s garment industry crisis is a microcosm of the global assault on workers’ rights.\nWe must celebrate all the rights that the labour and trade union movement has fought for and won.\nFrom fairer pay to weekends, everything that makes the lives of workers tolerable has been won by generations of struggle.\nYet over the last decade, trade unions have been under siege from the Conservatives.\nThe government must prove that it prioritises public health over private profit by beginning to take workers’ rights seriously.\nThat means removing unfair and unnecessary restrictions on trade unions, allowing people to come together and speak up on issues that affect them at work.\nIt also means they must repeal anti-trade union legislation, including the Trade Union Act 2016, and create new rights and freedoms for trade unions to help them win a better deal for working people.\nA recent investigation undertaken by Labour Behind the Label found evidence that conditions in Leicester’s factories, primarily producing for Boohoo, are putting workers at risk of Covid-19 infections and fatalities.\nSales of clothes made by suppliers in Leicester have helped fuel a rapid growth that could reward Boohoo’s bosses, including a billionaire, with bonuses worth £150 million as part of a three-year incentive scheme.\nIt is appalling that the exploited labour of residents of Leicester East is helping to finance such extravagant corporate salaries.\nThis demonstrates the stark inequality that exists in our society and is proof that the obscene wealth of billionaires is built on the exploitation of the working class.\nA wealth tax to make billionaires pay their fair share could not come sooner.\nRecent media reports suggest that some garment manufacturers in Leicester have vowed to defy the city’s local coronavirus lockdown, protesting that they cannot afford to lose any more money even if it means putting lives at risk.\nOne small business owner said: “I know coronavirus can kill but so can hunger and that’s why all of us need to continue working.”\nThis demonstrates the dire circumstances facing much of the beleaguered working class in Britain.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has torn further holes in a social fabric that was already stretched to breaking point.\nThis virus has demonstrated that we have a moral duty to ensure that everyone across Britain is protected.\nAfter this crisis, Leicester can no longer be known as the sweatshop of Britain. The government must prove that it prioritises public health over private profit by taking workers’ rights seriously.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Bunu derhal yapmalıdır.”\nİngiliz milletvekili Webbe, AA’nın “Kanıt” kitabını inceledi\nWebbe, röportajın ardından Anadolu Ajansının (AA) İsrail’in Gazze’ye yönelik saldırılarında beyaz fosfor kullanması başta olmak üzere işlediği savaş suçlarına yönelik belge niteliğindeki fotoğrafların yer aldığı “Kanıt” kitabını inceledi.\nAA’nın bu kitapla Gazze’de yaşanan ihlalleri belgeleyerek uluslararası kamuoyunun dikkatine sunduğu bilgisini alan Webbe, daha sonra kitaptaki bazı fotoğraflara ilişkin yorum yaptı.\nİsrail ordusunun şiddetli saldırılarına maruz kalan Filistinlilerin, güneydeki bölgelere göç ettiğini ortaya koyan bir fotoğrafı inceleyen Webbe, “Bu kesinlikle korkunç. Yeni Nekbe gibi. Nekbe’nin devamı. Nekbe’nin üzerinden 75 yıl geçti.” ifadesini kullandı.\nDaha sonra Webbe, kitap ve kitabın hazırlanmasında yapılan tüm çalışmalar için teşekkür etti.\n“Kanıt” kitabı İsrail’in suçlarını belgeliyor\nİsrail’in Gazze’de kadın ve çocuk ayrımı gözetmeksizin gerçekleştirdiği saldırılara başta Batılı ülkeler olmak üzere çoğu ülke sessiz kalırken, bazı ülkeler ise katliamlar için “delil yetersizliği” tezini ileri sürdü.\nSöz konusu iddialar üzerine AA, saldırıların başından bu yana önemli görev üstlenen foto muhabirleri ve kameramanların görüntülerini, uluslararası hukukta delil olması amacıyla kitaplaştırma kararı aldı.\nUzman bir ekip tarafından Türkçe, İngilizce ve Arapça hazırlanan kitap “Kanıt” ismiyle yayımlandı. Kanıt’ta İsrail’in Gazze’de işlediği insanlık suçları belge niteliğindeki fotoğraflarla gözler önüne serildi.\nBM Konvansiyonel Silahlar Sözleşmesi’ne göre kullanılması suç olan ve İsrail ordusunun Gazze’nin yoğun nüfuslu sivil bölgelerinde kullandığı beyaz fosforlu top mermilerinin fotoğrafları da kitapta yer aldı.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_black-history-is-british-history/content_945.html": "Black history is British history\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nThe intersectional crises we face require radical solutions to combat the injustices of racial and class inequality, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nBLACK history has never been more important. Across the world, racism and the far right are on the rise. Yet we have also seen the largest mobilisation of anti-racist protest for decades in the form of the inspiring Black Lives Matter movement.\nAt this crucial juncture, it has never been more important for us to learn from the history of racial oppression and to end the injustices that exist to this day.\nThe scourge of institutional racism continues to affect us in all walks of life, from police use of force to the disproportionate number of black children who go to bed hungry.\nBlack History Month is about celebrating our history. I am a daughter of the Windrush generation. When my family arrived from the Caribbean Island of Nevis, and settled in Leicester, they made tremendous sacrifices so that they could contribute to our local and national community.\nMy parents never lived to see their daughter make history as a Leicester-born member of Parliament representing a Leicestershire constituency or becoming the first black female member of Parliament for Leicester East.\nYet what will be remembered is the mistreatment of the Windrush generation as one of the most wicked chapters in modern British history.\nThe current government does not want to learn the lessons from the Windrush scandal.\nThe Conservative government is cynically using culture war tropes that are designed to divide communities against each other and distract from the real causes of inequality and injustice.\nBlack History Month is an opportunity to highlight and combat intersecting racial and class inequalities.\nWe have a government that is only too willing to divide our communities based on the colour of our skin, our religion and where we come from.\nThere is a dangerous connecting current that runs between the Sewell report, the Nationalities and Borders Bill, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill and many other initiatives taken by this government.\nThey all reveal a deeply troubling broader political project, which is designed to divide people against each other and distract from the real causes of inequality and injustice.\nThe government is cynically pretending that racism is an individual failing, not a systemic experience which is driven by powerful institutions, as was the case of colonialism, which resulted in millions of murders (direct and indirect), sexual abuses and extraction of natural resources inherent to imperial projects — yet is typical of this government’s point-blank refusal to acknowledge structural disadvantages and the pervasive legacy of empire.\nThe government’s aim to individualise racism and to claim that discrimination is no longer a societal issue is the betrayal of black history and an expression of the Thatcherite dogma that “there is no such thing as society.”\nOur collective revolutionary response is, to reject this government’s attempts to divide us up and to fight — together — for a world free of racial and class inequalities.\nAs Kwame Nkrumah highlighted when challenging the use of the derogatory term “Third World”, he said: “The oppressed and exploited peoples are the struggling revolutionary masses committed to the socialist world … They do not constitute a ‘Third World’ — they are part of the revolutionary upsurge which is everywhere challenging the capitalist, imperialist and neocolonialist power of reaction and counter-revolution … committed to the hilt in the struggle against capitalism, to end the exploitation.”\nThe government could instead drop its counterproductive crusade against the concept of institutional racism, and outline a target-driven plan to end the shocking racial disparities that continue to plague British society.\nUltimately, it could abandon its divisive agenda and commit to governing in the interests of all citizens — regardless of the colour of their skin or their country of birth.\nThe pandemic has reaffirmed the ways in which race and class perniciously intersect. The crises we face today, from climate change to the rise of authoritarian governments, are animated by class struggles.\nWhen we look at our world today — a world in which half of global wealth belongs to the richest 1 per cent; a world in which global and regional inequalities are defined by racialised violence and extraction — we see another historical epoch which remains defined by “the oppressor and oppressed.”\nThis Black History Month, it is vital that we recognise the integral role that black socialists — and especially black women — have played within the labour movement.\nThere have been many influential African revolutionaries who understood the interconnection between violent imperialism and extractive capitalism.\nThe words of Walter Rodney, the Guyanese historian and political activist, in his influential How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, still ring true today: “The workers of Europe (and eventually the inhabitants of the whole world) paid a huge price so that the capitalists could make their profits from the human labour that always lies behind the machines … that is why at the moment capitalism stands in the path of further human social development … the social (class) relations of capitalism are now outmoded, just as slave and feudal relations became outmoded in their time.”\nThere are also countless inspiring socialists within the African diaspora. As the US socialist Angela Davis said: “If we are going to rise out of our oppression, our poverty, if we are going to cease being the targets of the racist-minded mentality of racist policemen, we will have to obliterate a system in which a few wealthy capitalists are guaranteed the privilege of becoming richer and richer, whereas the people who are forced to work for the rich, and especially black people, never take any significant step forward.”\nThis is equally applicable to Britain. As Jamaican-British sociologist Stuart Hall wrote: “There is no understanding of Englishness without understanding its imperial and colonial dimensions.”\nA study of Hall, who wrote during the rise of Thatcherism in the 1970s and ’80s, is especially relevant given recent debates within the left, particularly his assertion that “the right of the labour movement … has no ideas of any compelling quality, except the instinct for short-term political survival.\n“It would not know an ideological struggle if it stumbled across one in the dark. The only ‘struggle’ it engages in with any trace of conviction is the one against the left.”\nIndeed, the ongoing fight for a £15-per-hour minimum wage would overwhelmingly benefit African, African-Caribbean, Asian and racialised workers, who are disproportionately employed in underpaid and undervalued jobs.\nThere is also an endless list of inspiring black British socialist women, from Stella Dadzie (who helped to set up the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent that challenged the white domination of the women’s liberation movement), to young academics such as Lola Olufemi — to name but a few.\nThe intersectional crises we face, require radical solutions. We stand on a precipice, in which the crises of climate breakdown, rampant racial inequality and the shockingly uneven distribution of wealth seem irreversible.\nYet as socialists, we know that there is an alternative, that it is possible to build a society around the needs of all its citizens and the principles of solidarity.\nIt is up to all of us as revolutionaries to fight for that better world in which all of us, regardless of the colour of our skin, can live in dignity.\nBlack history is British history — let us all pledge to continue the struggle for full racial and class equality.\nLet us resolve for our proud history to be taught all year round. And let us fight for a fairer future so that future generations will celebrate our achievements today and every day.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Webbe was born and raised in the city and remained there to the end of her university education.\nHer father worked, with his identical twin brother, as an engineer’s hand at the former Wadkin Factory on Green Lane Road, while her mother – in a city famous for its garment production – was a dress maker who ‘made clothes to last’, who worked for companies like the old Fenwick and Corah & Sons.\nWebbe has distinguished herself in Parliament by her fearless campaigning on local and international issues, from dangerous sweat-shop garment factories in Leicester and abroad, domestic abuse and politically-driven cuts to services, to the genocide in Gaza and the oppression of Indian farmers. She was also the only MP to speak out against the government’s dangerous plan, unopposed by Labour, to replace medical doctors with ‘physician associates’ – part of the so-called privatisation drive pushed by both main parties that she has also been vocal in opposing – helping to draw attention to the cost-cutting plan and make it the national issue it has become.\nShe has refused to back down on these and other issues despite a torrent of racist abuse from supporters of other parties and of the oppressors.\nMs Webbe said: ‘‘It has been an honour and privilege to serve the people of Leicester East as their MP, representing all communities with passion and integrity, and I will ask them to re-elect me so that I can continue to serve their interests.\nMy independence means I’ll listen to local people and put them first. I’ll place people and planet over profit and vote for humanity and never against. I will work for justice for Leicester East.\nI have shown that I will not stand-by silent while division and damage is done to Leicester East and the needs of the people ignored or injustice is perpetrated elsewhere in our name. After so many years of cuts and cruelty in this country, and wars overseas, the needs of ordinary people in Leicester East have never been greater to have me as their MP, who will genuinely stand up for them and what they care about, and not serve narrow party agendas or corporate donors.\nMy track record as MP for Leicester East shows that I understand their concerns and that I will work for the issues they care about, from low pay and exploitation in the garment industry and the closure of local services, to protecting access to NHS doctors, to speaking out for justice in Palestine, calling for a lasting, permanent ceasefire in Gaza.\nWith the support of the people of Leicester East I will continue to campaign tirelessly for real change, real justice and a reversal of the inequality that has enriched a few while the many struggle”.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_as-it-hits-one-million-covid-19-cases-brazil-needs-our-solidarity-2/content_235.html": "As it hits one million Covid-19 cases, Brazil needs our solidarity\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nAs of June 20 it was reported that Brazil had seen 49,090 deaths from Covid-19, with 1,038,568 cases. This horrific number means Brazil now has the second highest death toll and the second highest number of cases in the world from COVID-19 behind the USA.\nBrazil has some 210 million inhabitants making it the sixth most populated country in the world. There is great concern amongst experts that the peak has not yet been reached, and that official figures continue to under-report the real extent of the spread of the pandemic.\nDespite these devastating figures Brazil’s far-right President, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to regularly play down the risks of the pandemic and its human cost – instead focusing his attention on attacking what he terms ‘media hysteria.’\nEarly in the crisis he dismissed coronavirus as “just a little flu” and at one point even suggested, without any evidence, that Brazilians may have a natural immunity to the disease.\nAs the death toll has grown there has been no change of course from Bolsonaro from his deeply reactionary policies that are inflicting so much pain on Brazilians.\nRather than taking action to protect public health, the far-right President has consistently refused to advocate or implement the necessary ‘lockdown,’ social distancing and other measures advised by the World Health Organisation, and which have been taken by any country or region that has had any success in limiting the spread of COVID-19.\nInstead, last week Bolsonaro took the opportunity to follow Trump’s lead by threatening to withdraw Brazil from the World Health Organisation, accusing the UN agency of “ideological bias.” Astonishingly, given his Government’s terrible handling of the pandemic, he motivated his attack on the WHO by saying “we don’t need outsiders to give us clues about health in here.”\nWith his policies leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths, Bolsonaro has seen his approval ratings slump as opposition grows to his disastrous handling of the pandemic.\nA recent poll conducted by the Brazilian institute Datafolha showed his disapproval ratings up by five points to 43 percent – the highest it has been since the beginning of his government in January 2019.\nAdditionally, the poll found that “the part of the population that never believes President Jair Bolsonaro’s statements has increased from 38 to 44 percent”, and that 37 percent of those interviewed believe Bolsonaro “never behaves as a president should.”\nThis growing opposition is not just reflected in opinion polls.\nAround the world we have seen social media videos of daily pots and pans protests from peoples’ balconies in Brazil demanding that Bolsonaro goes. The Workers’ Party (PT) and other progressive political parties have launched an impeachment bid. Indigenous communities, joined by NGOs and others internationally, have launched appeals for urgent action to stop the deadly spread of Coronavirus to the Amazon and other areas where there is little or no provision for health emergencies. We have seen Black Lives Matter, pro-democracy and other movements erupt in protest against a range of Bolsonaro’s reactionary policies.\nAs is to be expected from a President who has regularly expressed his admiration for the country’s former military dictatorship – which killed, tortured and injured thousands of people between 1964 and 1985 – Bolsonaro last week went on the offensive against these growing opposition movements.\nIn particular, he lashed out at Black Lives Matter protesters.\nNo doubt stirring up his violent far-right activist base, Bolsonaro said “We are witnessing groups of marginal terrorists who want to break Brazil… They are threatening us,” and went on to argue that the protesters “are marginalized people, terrorists, pot-users, unemployed people” who “want to break Brazil.”\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro is clearly scared of the power of these movements to transform society and challenge injustice.\nIndeed, Bolsonaro recently said of Trump that “He is my friend, he is my brother…. I send a hug to Trump. Brazil wants to deepen our relationship more and more [and] I push for his re-election.”\nThese comments reflect how reactionary hard and far right-wing forces are building strong links internationally. This includes Trump and Bolsonaro but is also very much a growing factor we must consider here in Britain.\nThese same hard and far-right forces also advocate similar policies internationally when it comes to dealing with the Coronavirus crisis and its impact – putting the interests of private profit before people and health.\nAnd they are following the same scapegoating tactics to escape blame for the consequences of these disastrous policies, targeting black and migrant communities.\nBut they are also facing a growing global rebellion against their twisted priorities, with the Blacks Lives Matter movement at its heart.\nAs this resistance builds, we must also urgently build international links if we are going to successfully meet the challenges we face.\nAnd as part of this we must build international solidarity with those in the frontline in the battles against the far-right across the globe and struggling for a different kind of society and world, including those heroic people fighting in Brazil.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

Claudia Webbe says that all the parties involved in the attacks on Gaza, including international accomplices of Israel, should face trial.\nSpeaking to Anadolu, Webbe told Anadolu about arguments that Britain is an accomplice due to the destruction and humanitarian crisis caused by the attacks in Gaza, and the political and military support provided by the UK.\nExpressing dismay over the situation in Gaza, Webbe stressed the devastating nature of Israel’s attacks on Gaza for over 160 days, calling it horrendous.\nWebbe highlighted that the International Court of Justice has found that these attacks carry a reasonable risk of genocide, adding: “We are in the (Muslim holy) month of Ramadan. There is no break or cease-fire. This is absolutely destructive.”\nWebbe also said Israel, through its crippling blockade of humanitarian aid, uses hunger as a weapon of war and that the bombings and airstrikes on civilians in Gaza continue, resulting in more loss of life daily, especially affecting women and children.\nWebbe urged an immediate ceasefire, calling for Israel to stop its bombing and persecution of the people of Gaza.\nHer official complaint to the world court, made last December, called for an investigation and prosecution of Israel’s war crimes, including genocide and crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people.\nShe said those responsible for the attacks on Gaza and harm to civilians should face trial in criminal courts to be held accountable for their actions.\nWebbe said she specifically holds the Israeli government, including key figures like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and all Cabinet members, responsible for directing these actions and causing harm to the people of Gaza.\nUK support for Israel, arms supplies\nDecrying the UK’s political and military support for Israel, Webbe said it is clear that since last Oct. 7, when Israel’s offensive began after a cross-border raid by Hamas, the UK has not only protected Israel but has also been an accomplice in supplying weapons to Israel for some time.\nWebbe stressed the need for the UK to stop arming Israel, stating that despite this, the country continues to issue arms sale licenses to Israel and provide military aid.\nShe said that these actions by the UK amount to complicity in genocide committed against civilians in Gaza and that this must end immediately.\nWebbe called on the British government to halt arms aid to Israel, impose immediate sanctions, and support the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in providing essential food and resources to Gaza residents.\nAnadolu also presented to Webbe its book The Evidence, which documents Israel’s war crimes, including the use of white phosphorus in attacks on Gaza.\nWebbe thanked Anadolu for the book and all the work that went into preparing it.\nDeadly offensive\nIsrael has waged a deadly military offensive on the Gaza Strip since an Oct. 7 cross-border attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in which some 1,200 Israelis were killed.\nNearly 32,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have since been killed in Gaza, and nearly 74,200 injured amid mass destruction and shortages of necessities.\nThe Israeli war, now in its 167th day, has pushed 85% of Gaza’s population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of most food, clean water, and medicine, while 60% of the enclave’s infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN.\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which in January issued an interim ruling ordering Tel Aviv to stop genocidal acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_palestinians-in-uk-seek-visa-scheme-for-relatives-in-gaza-strip/content_381.html": "British Palestinians are escalating their campaign to bring their families over from Gaza.\nMore than 300 British-Palestinian families are petitioning their MPs and the Home Office to set up a scheme that would allow their relatives in Gaza to travel to the UK to escape the war.\nThe British government set up a similar programme after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nIt allows Ukrainians with family members in the UK to stay in the country for up to three years.\nOther such schemes exist for people from Afghanistan and Hong Kong.\n“We’re just trying to save their lives,” British-Palestinian campaigner Sam Habeeb told The National.\nHis siblings, nieces and nephews are in Gaza, where they have been displaced three times since the conflict began. “We thought it would be the normal cycle of violence that lasts a few days or weeks. Now it’s been months,” he said.\nA panel discussion on the issue took place at the House of Lords on Wednesday, and Mr Habeeb was among those who took part.\nHe said the number of Palestinians brought to the UK under such a scheme would be small.\n“We’re not asking the British government to bring tens of thousands of Palestinians to the UK,” he told the House of Lords, adding that the families would need assurances of their return to Gaza after the war.\n“The right of return is a red line for us as British Palestinians. The refugees should go back to their homes,” he said.\n“Some Palestinians may go to Europe, the UK, some people will spend a few months in Egypt before going back to Gaza. But the majority would want to go back to their homes.”\nAbout a dozen families attended the discussion and spoke about their experience. Representatives of NGOs were also present, along with MPs including Labour’s Kim Johnson and Claudia Webbe.\nA spokeswoman for charity Love Bristol praised the “positive effects” of the Ukrainian visa scheme, and called for a similar programme for Palestinians.\n“We’re offering something that is in the opposite spirit of war through a visa scheme,” she added.\nBaroness Natalie Bennett, a Green Party peer who organised the discussion, said she planned to write an open letter to lobby MPs about a family resettlement scheme for Palestinians. She lamented the high costs British Palestinians currently have to pay to secure visas for their families.\nThe Home Office has been contacted for comment.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_bail-out-the-many-not-the-few/content_844.html": "Bail out the many, not the few\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nNow is the time to build on the spirit of unity and solidarity, writes CLAUDIA WEBBE MP\nTHIS week the Daily Telegraph reported leaked Treasury policies that should set alarm bells ringing.\nThe paper sets out a proposed “policy package” of tax rises and spending cuts that could be announced soon in order to “enhance credibility and boost investor confidence.”\nIn other words, the Tories and sections of big business are seeking to use the current crisis to argue for a new wave of “shock therapy” austerity to “reset” the economy.\nAs the socialist economist Grace Blakeley put it this week, if the Tories get their way the government’s extra assistance and spending “will continue for as long as it benefits the wealthy — and not for a minute longer.”\nThis is exactly what many of us on the Labour benches in Parliament warned may happen when George Osborne, the architect of the last round of austerity, recently argued that similar measures would be needed again. It must be firmly resisted.\nMeasures in the leak included an increase in income tax, the end of the triple lock on state pension increases and a two-year public-sector pay freeze.\nMeanwhile, billionaire tax exiles trapped in Britain by the lockdown are being granted a reprieve from paying higher tax bills.\nAdditionally, we have seen policies floated that would further hit the living standards of the majority of people — such as increases in transport fares and cuts to benefits — at a time when millions of people already simply can’t afford them.\nTrade unions have repeatedly warned during the coronavirus crisis that we could be on the brink of another economic crisis and millions of people’s livelihoods are at risk.\nThis was confirmed recently by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, that Britain was heading for a deep recession. Illustrating this, unemployment had already increased by 22,000 to 1.36 million in the three months to February — even before Covid-19 lockdown measures were put in place.\nRecent figures also showed that poverty, including in-work poverty, was increasing.\nOver the last decade, Conservative governments have implemented an ideologically driven policy of austerity that has left our public services weakened, vulnerable and underfunded; escalated insecurity at work; and brought about a long and continuing squeeze on the living standards of the majority of people.\nThese reckless policies have left all of our society, public services and households less resilient than we should have been when facing this crisis.\nFurthermore, the current crisis, with its severe economic impacts, will already be deepening many of these problems.\nHaving now taken extraordinary action to prevent economic collapse due to the coronavirus crisis, it is becoming clearer each week that the Tories are already working out how to distribute this burden, in the future, across the overwhelming majority of the population.\nIt is many of the keyworkers that are currently keeping our society running who will suffer most if a new wave of austerity is unleashed.\nIt is these same workers who have already disproportionately and unnecessarily suffered because of the government’s mishandling of its response to the pandemic.\nLet us not forget we are talking about a government that was slow to lock down and failed when it came to testing and personal protective equipment and much more besides.\nA return to “business as usual” when it comes to how our economy is restructured would be deeply damaging for both our economy and society.\nWhat is needed is far from another wave of austerity and cuts.\nAfter the amazing efforts and sacrifices we are seeing across every community and locality in Britain — and the drastic measures that have been taken in so many areas of our economy and society — people will rightly not accept a return to the growing insecurity that marked the last decade in particular.\nInstead of yet more austerity, we desperately need a recognition that in our country of deep and unequal wealth the top 1 per cent should be asked to contribute a little bit more, including through increased taxes on corporate profits.\nThis would enable us to expand the support available to public services, social security and other measures to defend the living standards of the majority of people.\nAlongside this, when it is safe for more people to return to work, the government will need to use its power to reboot our economy.\nThis needs to include policies such as investment in infrastructure and public transport, with a green new deal and a social-housing building programme across the country.\nSuch policies based on investment would limit economic damage in the short to medium term, get sectors of the economy going again and help improve living standards.\nAll of these measures would pay for themselves in the long term.\nDuring this crisis we have experienced our dependence on each other, clearly showing the Thatcherite mantra that there is no such thing as society was wrong.\nThursday’s weekly “claps for carers” and the development of mutual aid groups show a new spirit of unity and solidarity.\nCrises often shape the future. From the horrors of the second world war, the left created the welfare state and our treasured NHS.\nNow we need to develop a collective commitment to building a different and more equal economy and society in the years ahead.\nPeople don’t want to go on as before, where the 99 per cent are always forced to pay for the bailouts for the super-rich.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_mps-reveal-the-scale-of-online-abuse-they-reiceve/content_595.html": "MPs reveal the scale of online abuse they receive\nMembers of Parliament from across Leicestershire have revealed tales of death threats, racism and misogynistic abuse online, after a new study uncovered the extent of social media abuse MPs face. More than 3,000 offensive tweets are sent to UK MPs on a daily basis, researchers found.\nData analysts and journalists from the BBC, ITV, Reach and other organisations gathered and analysed three million tweets directed at MPs over the course of six weeks between March and April this year, and found one in every 20 tweets was ‘toxic’. They also learned that female MPs were marginally more likely to receive abuse than their male counterparts.\nIt was further found that less well-known backbench MPs were more abused online than better-known politicians. In response to the findings, some local MPs have shared with LeicestershireLive their own experiences of dealing with online trolls.\nLiz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, said she believed people should be free to speak without being subjected to vile abuse that “people would never say to your face in public”.\nShe said: “Our democracy matters. People should be free to say what they believe and what they think, and not have to put up with being attacked. Things were particularly bad when I ran for Labour leader in 2015, and during the Brexit referendum. I was sent lots of mocked-up images, aggressive and extremely sexualised tweets of abuse. It’s disgusting.”\nClaudia Webbe, Leicester East’s independent MP, said she was targeted by some form of online abuse every day. Most MPs did not want to share examples of the abuse to which they had been subjected. However, Ms Webbe allowed LeicestershireLive access to some of the hateful messages she had received on Twitter.\nShe said: “As an MP, I receive horrific, violent, misogynistic and racist online abuse, on a daily and hourly basis.”\nOne message read: “It’s time to start the deportation process. Let’s kick it off by booting Claudia Webbe into Africa or some such s** hole. Then the Pakistanis can get themselves packed up and shipped back off to their home land. Time to get rid of the s**.” Another included a call to “behead Claudia first”.\nIn other comments, Ms Webbe was called “an evil witch”, “vile” and a “nasty piece of work”. One Twitter user labelled her as “racist” after a tweet claimed the MP “blocks white people” on the platform.\nDr Luke Evans, Conservative member for Bosworth, said some online abuse had developed into real-life incidents. He said: “Every post of mine, be it on TikTok or Twitter, gets some level of abuse. Most of it is sticks and stones stuff that I’m happy to live with as a public figure, but there have been incidents where it’s developed from being based behind a screen into something more serious – and in the real world – which has led to police involvement.\n“The threats I’ve received have ranged from posting faeces through the letterbox of my constituency office and graffitiing my house, to targets against my family and I. I am very keen to see the Government bring back the Online Safety Bill, which will help hold platforms to account for posts that are in direct contravention of their own terms of service. I think it’s an important step towards making these sites a more enjoyable place for all users.”\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_regardless-of-their-immigration-status-we-must-protect-everyone-in-britain-from-this-virus/content_261.html": "Regardless of their immigration status, we must protect everyone in Britain from this virus\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nWe must repeal the 2014 Immigration Act, reverse the ‘hostile environment’ and shut detention centres for good, writes Claudia Webbe\nTHE coronavirus pandemic has caused widespread suffering for too many individuals and communities across Britain.\nWe do not yet know the full impact of the unprecedented economic disruption caused by the virus.\nWith widespread job losses, it is certain that it will have exacerbated the hardship caused by a decade of austerity.\nWhile the government’s financial support for businesses and employees has been far from perfect, many of those affected have been able to claim at least some modicum of support to cope with this crisis.\nYet this opportunity has not been afforded to some of the most vulnerable people in Britain.\nCurrently there is an unknown number of persons who are not citizens, who do not have leave to remain in this country.\nFor a demographic that already faces uncommonly difficult challenges in their daily lives, the pandemic has only deepened fears over how to maintain an income, remain healthy or even stay alive.\nThere are an estimated one million undocumented workers who lack any entitlement to support from the state, and who are therefore entirely without funds to feed, clothe and house themselves and their families.\nMany undocumented people are destitute and living in the shadows, fearful of what will happen to them if they identify themselves.\nThey cannot access healthcare, emergency shelter and food, nor report or seek protection from domestic violence, rape, exploitation and other awful abuses.\nIn nearly all cases, undocumented people are not criminals — but simply those who have fallen through the cracks of the government’s callous hostile environment policies.\nUnder this government citizenship rights have been deliberately obscured and deportation and removal targets have taken precedence.\nYet they have made no effort to end hostile environment policies, which were found to be institutionally racist by the official inquiry into the Windrush scandal.\nFor people forced to endure this level of precarity, it is impossible to comply with government guidance on self-isolation and social distancing.\nI believe that everyone has the right to be in an environment where they can follow the public health directives necessary to limit viral transmissions.\nIt is imperative — and in the best interest of everyone in our country — that the basic needs of all those who are living in our country are met, especially given the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on African, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\nThe tragic irony is that many undocumented people, who are living in constant fear of the British state, work in front-line services that the government has been at pains to praise during this crisis.\nThe pandemic has shown that the people who really keep our society ticking are not billionaires and the super-rich, but nurses, carers, cleaners, checkout attendants and many more essential front-line workers.\nWe must ensure that all front-line workers, regardless of their immigration status, are valued and protected as we rebuild our economy and society.\nThe mistreatment of undocumented migrants reveals the fundamental hypocrisy of this government.\nIt does not matter how many Cabinet ministers applauded NHS staff and front-line workers in front of television cameras on Thursday nights if they then do not ensure their safe residency in Britain.\nIt is vital that we repay the extraordinary contribution of front-line workers with a permanent extension of migrant rights\nThat means an end to the hostile environment, shutting detention centres and granting indefinite leave to everyone living in Britain.\nAt a time when hate crime has more than doubled since 2013, with over 100,000 offences in 2018-19, it has never been more important for the demonisation of migrants to end.\nThat means repealing the 2014 Immigration Act, reversing the “hostile environment” and shutting detention centres for good.\nIt also means that it is essential for the government to take immediate action to ensure that leave to remain is granted to everyone in Britain, irrespective of their nationality or immigration status, so that they can access healthcare, food and housing.\nAs lockdown measures are prematurely relaxed by this reckless government, it is also crucial that everyone in our society can adhere to advice on social distancing, ensure the health of themselves and their families and help protect the wellbeing of all people in Britain.\nI congratulate organisations like the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers’ Union, the Status Now Network and the dozens of civil rights groups who have called for the British and Irish governments to deliver justice to all those living in Britain.\nTogether, we can build a society in which everyone is valued — no matter their country of birth.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_this-is-a-community-that-suffers-a-lot-of-hate-and-lives-in-poverty/content_278.html": "‘This is a community that suffers a lot of hate and lives in poverty’\nAndrew Murray catches up with Leicester East MP CLAUDIA WEBBE, who will be standing as an independent in a city stricken by rapacious fashion-brand employers, sectarian frictions and urban decay – a city where principled socialism is more valuable than ever\nZARAH definitely wants her picture taken with her local MP.\nThe 11-year old, standing in Green Lanes Road, a centre of Leicester’s Muslim community, supports her plea with an irresistible smile.\n“I wrote you a letter, and you wrote back,” she reminds Claudia Webbe. “Was it about Gaza?” the MP asks. “Yes it was.”\nPhoto taken, with the assistance of the Morning Star’s reporter, Webbe is stopped again 10 seconds later, this time by a constituent who moves without missing a beat from knife crime — particularly deplorable during Ramadan, he feels — and local parking problems.\nA short taxi ride through Victorian and Edwardian terraces and we are on Leicester’s Golden Mile — Belgrave Road, the centre of Indian culture and commerce in the city.\nThere the MP is immediately recognised by a disabled man with housing problems and then a Sri Lankan translator from Arabic to English who she refers to as “the professor,” although his exact academic status is never ascertained.\nThe “professor” is an enthusiast for his parliamentary representative, and pledges resolute support from his community.\nWebbe, Leicester born and raised, is on a roll. Her home city — well, not so much.\nA few months out from an election which Webbe will fight as an independent socialist in the Leicester East constituency, its citizens seem to have little to thank politics for.\nSince the last election the city has been doubly bruised. It has been abandoned by the super-exploitative fashion brands which offered low-wage employment to thousands of garment workers; and riven by attempts to mobilise around sectarian identities.\nA day with the MP is a window into this world. Leicester represents a diversity perhaps unique to Britain today — every branch of the people of south Asia, whether you slice and dice them by nationality, region or religion has a substantial presence.\nAnd it is a working-class presence. Median income in Leicester East is £10,000 below the national average and the rows of terraces stretching between Green Lanes and Belgrave Road don’t discriminate.\nThe Imperial Typewriters factory stands as a testament to a history of class struggle — it was the site of a 1974 strike by Asian workers against the effects of discrimination, a dispute shamefully not supported by the union.\nThe building still stands, although no typewriter has been made there for decades. Instead it subsists in a state of industrial semi-dereliction, divided into a mass of small sweatshops making this or that or, too often now, nothing at all judging by the number of padlocked doors.\nBroken pipes drip water, wiring is strung higgledy-piggledy, rubbish congeals in stairway corners and workers apparently prefer to enter and exit via rusting fire escapes.\nTheir undaunted MP marches up the stairs, ringing on doorbells and greeting those toiling in this dilapidation cheerfully.\nSam tells us that his kitchen manufacturing business has “good days, bad days” as an employee flings a huge number of faulty metal shelves into a skip while Bill chats cheerfully at the door of his premises, his affability not really obscuring his determination that we will not proceed further across the threshold even though he is satisfied we are not from the tax authorities.\n“The rag trade in Leicester is finished,” he opines, looking forward to an imminent retirement.\nYet a lot of money has been made from the ruins of this iconic building. A landlord in Scotland hoovers up the rent and, by the look of things, spends not a penny on improvements.\nAnd the monopolists of the fashion industry squeezed a fortune from the small businesses here before deciding the squeezing was better in other parts.\nTheir wretched role in driving down wages throughout the industry in Leicester exposed during the pandemic, the brands are now taking their business to Morocco and Pakistan.\nBut not without a passing PR gesture. We proceed to another barren industrial site, not iconic but surely symbolic.\nThat is the Boohoo operation on the edge of the city, set up to great fanfare as a token of the company’s “investment in Leicester” and then shut down, all in the space of two years, after a BBC probe.\nThe shiny new building was, it turns out, home to the same shoddy old practices and was full of people renegotiating contracts downwards with suppliers.\nIt rebadged clothing rather than making it. Thus rumbled, Boohoo was gone again. There was no-one in to greet the MP.\n“It’s a lie to say they are putting anything back into Leicester,” says Webbe. “Entirely phony.” Leicester is where monopolies go to make money, not spend it.\nAdd in Tory-driven austerity nationally and an ineffective Labour-run mayoral-led local authority in the city, the tinder was piling up for trouble like rubbish in an Imperial stairwell.\n“Deprivation, poverty, unemployment and a lack of hope” pervaded the city, Webbe argues. The lack of youth provision, in particular, opened the door to the religious right.\n“Youth centres were the place where community cohesion developed locally, but that is all shut,” leaving a vacuum others were all too keen to fill.\nAnd those “others” come from a variety of directions. Hindu chauvinism, and messages sent from India at the height of the disturbances, have been fingered.\nBut it’s not hard to find people anxious to blame recent migrants from southern India, allegedly backward and uneducated, for the trouble.\n“This is a community that suffers a lot of hate and lives in poverty,” Webbe says.\n“A lot of that community has now been captured by the Tories,” she adds, a shift made easier by the disempowerment of local councillors through the mayoral system in place in Leicester.\n“Councillors have no power, not even in their own ward,” Webbe says, making it harder to stay attuned to discontent on the ground.\nThe disturbances that rocked Leicester in October 2022 had nothing to do with religion, neither Hindu nor Muslim, she believes. Rather, social problems were inflamed by external actors, some of them indeed driven by the Hindu chauvinist ideology of India’s ruling BJP party.\nUnusually, the events were accompanied by symmetrical statements issued by the Indian and Pakistani diplomatic missions in Britain, each demanding that the British government act to protect their co-religionists from outrage.\nAzur, meanwhile, is outraged but not about his religion or anyone else’s. His garment manufacturing company went under via the failure of fashion retailer Missguided.\nIts rapacious approach to driving down contracts and indifference to paying its suppliers left him with over £600,000 in unpaid bills.\nNow he owns a well-tended care home, visited by Webbe as part of an Easter recess programme of dropping in on such establishments across her constituency.\n“The brands have abused Leicester,” Azur asserts incontrovertibly. “The brands have gone, and only dust is left.”\nWarming to his point, he claims “nobody has done anything for Leicester,” exempting only the MP on the other side of his desk from the sweep of his anger.\nHis solution is tariffs on imported clothing which he believes would force the major brands to reshore manufacturing to Britain.\nImmediately, he has to worry about the dysfunctional social care system, presently leaving his new enterprise operating well below break-even point.\nWebbe seems to have his vote, but she will have to fight for others as an independent candidate. She was excluded from the Labour Party — without appeal, of course — following a court case involving her private life.\nIn her place, Labour has chosen London’s deputy mayor for business, Rajesh Agrawal, as its standard bearer. He paid an immediate courtesy call on the East Midlands Chamber of Commerce and also took himself off on a trip to India.\nHopefully, a Labour candidate would stand against the importation of Hindu extremism. We shall see.\nThe contest is complicated by the looming presence — literally, he is on billboards across Leicester — of Webbe’s long-time predecessor Keith Vaz.\nVaz’s parliamentary career was terminated in 2019 after a sex and drugs scandal but he is neither out of sight nor out of mind. His leaflets are in wide circulation and he doesn’t appear short of funds.\nHe has not declared that he will try to regain his seat at the election, but it is hard to see what all the high visibility is for otherwise. Electoral cards hardly come much wilder.\nAnd Labour is in additional chaos after an ill-judged purge of sitting councillors before last year’s local elections alienated large numbers of power brokers and ordinary voters. The target was the left, it seems, but a number of Vaz supporters fell under the Starmerite tumbrils too.\nConsequently, the party lost substantial ground in the council chamber in a context where it was winning big nearly everywhere else.\nSo, Leicester politics feel volatile. Shaukat Patel, brother of Friends of al-Aqsa leader Ismael, will oppose Jonathan Ashworth in the neighbouring Leicester South seat as one of the Gaza-driven independents mushrooming across the country.\nNevertheless, with Labour enjoying Himalayan national polling leads winning traditional Labour seats from the left this year is an even more than usually mountainous task.\nWebbe has to hope that virtue is rewarded. To end at the beginning, the Star’s interview with her was slightly delayed by the unscheduled arrival at her constituency office of a delegation of dignified Indian men.\nThey had turned up to thank the MP for resolving the residency status of one of their number, who had lived in the country 21 years. Webbe was given a cake in gratitude for doing battle with the bureaucratic barbarism of the Home Office.\nTheir votes seem in the bag. Leicester East voters are well-served by their representative.\nHopefully they will retain her. Claudia Webbe is a courageous and principled socialist — moreover she stands between her constituents and being dragged into the dungheap of sectarian and communal recrimination. Surely a cause worth fighting for.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East. You can follow her at www.facebook.com/claudiaforLE and twitter.com/ClaudiaWebbe",

  "https_claudiawebbe_org_/https_claudiawebbe_org_the-governments-divide-and-rule-culture-wars-must-be-opposed/content_527.html": "The Tory government’s divide and rule culture wars must be opposed\nBy Claudia Webbe MP\nCLAUDIA WEBBE says the Conservatives are cracking down on discussion of racism- and how to fight it\nAT THE end of Black History Month, it is important to reflect on the crucial juncture for race relations that we find ourselves in. Across the world, racism and the far right are on the rise. Yet we have also seen the largest mobilisation of anti-racist protest for decades in the form of the inspiring Black Lives Matter movement.\nIt has never been more important for us to learn from the history of racial oppression and to end the injustices that exist to this day. Yet the government has chosen Black History Month to wage war against an accurate teaching of institutional racism in our schools.\nDuring a debate on Black History Month, Kemi Badenoch MP, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury who is also the Women and Equalities Minister, strongly criticised the Black Lives Matter movement and declared that schools teaching critical race theory will be breaking the law. She prohibited teachers from telling children about the fact that white privilege exists.\nThis means that our government is in auspicious company, as a month previously President Donald Trump declared that critical race theory (CRT) is “like a cancer,” and signed executive orders banning its use in federal agency training schemes.\nWe should be very alarmed that our government is directly copying culture war strategies from Donald Trump’s racist playbook. Yet even more than that, we should be worried by their refusal to recognise the reality of institutional racism.\nDuring the Black Lives Matter movement, we’ve rightly seen renewed calls for our schools to teach the true brutal history of the British empire and the legacy of imperialism, colonialism and racism which continue today to have generational impact.\nPresent day global inequalities remain permanently shaped by the horrors of extractive colonialism and racialised subordination. It is unacceptable that instances of appalling murder and violence at the hands of the British state have been erased from present-day memory of empire.\nIt is barely known, for instance, that one fifth of the billionaires in Britain owe their wealth to the transportation of our Black ancestors. If we are to end the scourge of institutional racism and the destructive legacy of colonialism, it is vital that young people are taught the true history of race relations.\nDespite what our government believes, it is simply not the case that the existence of institutional racism is up for debate. For instance, it is beyond dispute that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate impact on Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. The latest ONS data on ethnic contrasts in Covid-19 deaths showed that in England and Wales, males of black African ethnic background had the highest rate of death, which was 2.7 times higher than males of white ethnic background. Women of a black Caribbean ethnic background also had the highest rate, which is 2.0 times higher than females of white ethnic background.\nThese inequalities are grounded in class inequalities and reflect the severe racial disparities in our economy. The Resolution Foundation think tank estimate that Black, Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi employees experience an annual pay penalty of £3.2 billion. The grim intersection of racial and class discrimination has had a deadly consequence during this pandemic.\nIn May, I asked the Prime Minister how he intended to protect African, Asian and minority ethnic communities from the virus.\nFive months later, his government has refused to take any actions that would specifically protect our communities. If it is unwilling to even recognise the connection between economic and physical wellbeing, it is clear this government is not serious about combatting health inequalities.\nMany have tried to dismiss the imbalance in deaths as being explained by cultural — or even genetic — differences. Yet discrimination is deeply ingrained in our social, political, and economic structures.\nThe scourge of institutional racism results in unequal access to quality education, healthy food, liveable wages, and affordable housing — which are the foundations of health and wellbeing.\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, key workers are more likely than average to be from Black, Asian or minority ethnic communities, be women, be born outside the UK, and be paid less than the average UK income. An Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) study in September 2020 showed that of all the people from minority ethnic groups who were employed or self-employed at the start of the crisis, 13 per cent had lost their job by June – compared to 5 per cent of the overall population.\nThe IPPR thinktank, who published research with the Runnymede Trust, found that almost 60,000 more deaths involving coronavirus could have occurred in England and Wales if white people faced the same risk as black communities.\nIt is two years since the Conservative government launched its consultation on ethnicity pay reporting — which sought to enable government and employers to move forward in a consistent and transparent way. The consultation closed in January 2019 but still the government have not reported back on it or confirmed a date for mandatory ethnicity pay reporting to start.\nThe government’s decision to wage war on critical race theory reveals their contempt for African, Asian and minority ethnic communities. We on the left cannot allow their divide and rule culture wars to win. We must keep pushing for economic and public health support for our communities, and keep fighting against the divisive tactics of this administration.\nClaudia Webbe MP is the member of Parliament for Leicester East.

This risks undermining important efforts to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.\nAt just £95.85 per week, Statutory Sick Pay in the UK is among the lowest in Europe. The TUC estimates that it is equal to only a fifth of the average worker’s weekly earnings. Nearly 2 million low-paid workers are entirely excluded from claiming Sick Pay altogether because they earn less than £120 per week.\nThe Government must urgently act to address the deeply inadequate levels of Statutory Sick Pay before the current lockdown ends.\nI have added my solidarity to this by signing the joint letter below to Rishi Sunak.\nI really enjoyed speaking at this important event to mark Islamophobia Awareness Month.\nI have volunteered with Muslim food banks in Leicester, and I know from personal experience the generosity and selflessness which is at the heart of the Islamic religion.\nI will do everything in my power to fight against the demonisation of the Muslim community and to combat Islamophobia in all its forms.\nYou can watch the whole online event below.\nDuring this pandemic, the government has handed out £18 billion to private companies, many of which had little or no experience in public health and whose only qualification seem to be a close personal relationship with a member of the government.\nThis is a government that is frivolous when it comes to handing public money out to Tory\ndonors or private companies, but penny pinching when it comes to bailing out communities in Leicester East and across the country.\nFrom the scandal in Leicester’s garment industry, to corporate giants misusing taxpayer bailouts to further exploit their workforce, the unprecedented economic impact of the coronavirus has laid bare the weakness of our labour protections.\nWorkers rights and trade union protections must be protected and expanded.\nThis crisis has demonstrated the need for us to build a society built around the principles of solidarity and in which all of us, regardless of our job, can live in dignity.\nOur NHS is a gleaming beacon of human achievement, the embodiment of socialist, universal principles.People in Leicester will not allow the government to privatise our NHS in a grubby trade deal with the US.\nWe will always defend our most treasured public institution.\nThe Union Learning Fund has been getting working people into skills training they would otherwise have no access to for two decades.\nYet at a time of economic crisis, the government has announced that it will cease funding this crucial initiative.\nIt has never been more important for people, in Leicester and across the UK, to be able to retrain and gain skills. I urge the government to reconsider it’s decision.\nThis report shows that all but one part of Leicestershire now in top 100 areas for coronavirus infection rates. This is very concerning. Our community of Leicester has disproportionately suffered from this government’s mishandling of the Pandemic. The government must urgently fix it’s disastrous test, track and trace system by bringing into public ownership.\nRead the full report in the Leicester Mercury here.\nThank you to the Midland Langar Seva Society, who have been instrumental in providing for vulnerable residents across Leicester during this pandemic.\nReligious organisations, charities and food banks have been incredible over the last few months. You can see a list of some of the wonderful local organisations here. Whilst feeding the vulnerable should not be left to the charity sector, it is inspiring to see such excellent community spirit.\nThe MLSS organisation has been working seven days a week since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis and have already delivered 100k meals and counting!\nYou can read the full article in the Leicester Mercury here.\nThe Pfizer vaccination news is very welcome and I am hopeful for everyone in Leicester, across the UK and all over the world.\nAs soon as a vaccine is produced, it must be distributed for free and based on need –not the ability to pay or for private profit.\nWe have all suffered as a result of this virus, and it is crucial that we are all protected from it.\nMore information on the vaccination here.\nIt was a pleasure to virtually meet with Leicester Climate Action, Leicester Friends of theEarth and Leicester Global Action group. The climate crisis is already here. We cannot delay the urgent action that is necessary to transform our economy and society. I look forward to working with these excellent Leicester campaigners as we fight for a liveable future.\nI have called for knife crime to be declared an epidemic after spree of random stabbings in Leicester after Carlos Racitalal was convicted of attempted murder yesterday.\nIt is beyond comprehension as to why anyone would attempt to kill vulnerable and defenceless victims and especially children as young as 5 and 10 years of age. These incidents brought shock and fear to our communities of Belgrave and Leicester East.\nYesterday’s ruling is an important delivery of justice, and a demonstration that we can never accept violence or hate on the streets of Leicester.\nYou can read my full article in the Leicester Mercury here.\nI am proud to have written a chapter of the Socialist Campaign Group’s new pamphlet, which focuses on the need for workers’ rights fit for the 21st Century.\nThe scandalous mistreatment of workers’ in Leicester‘s garment industry is best understood as an extreme microcosm of the national and global decay of worker’s rights during the failed neoliberal project of the last forty years.\nThe Tories and sections of big business argue that the mistreatment of workers is inevitable – that rights, fair pay, and dignity in the workplace are an acceptable cost to their bottom line. Yet their free market race to the bottom has normalised poverty, hopelessness and exploitation in our communities.\nNow is the time for us on the left to fight for a society built around the principles of solidarity and in which all of us, regardless of our job, can live in dignity.\nAs we close Black History Month in the UK, it is important to reflect on the crucial juncture for race relations that we find ourselves in. Across the world, racism and the far right are on the rise.\nMeanwhile the government has decided to a wage war on critical race theory. The government via their Minister, Kemi Badenoch during the debate in Parliament on Black History Month strongly criticised the Black Lives Matter movement and declared that schools teaching ‘critical race theory’ will be breaking the law.\nShe went as far as seeking to prohibit teachers from teaching children about the existence of white privilege.\nWe should be very alarmed that our government is directly copying culture war strategies from Donald Trump’s racist playbook. Yet even more than that, we should be worried by their refusal to recognise the reality of institutional racism.\nWe on the left cannot allow their divide and rule culture wars to win. We must keep pushing for economic and public health support for our communities in Leicester and across the UK and keep fighting against the divisive tactics of this administration.\nRead my full article in the Morning Star here.\nThe Government’s’ treatment of Leicester, as well as regions in the North and Midlands, has been nothing short of a disgrace during recent weeks.\nIt has sacrificed areas of the UK, including Leicester, Greater Manchester, and Newcastle, on the altar of a false, ideologically-driven understanding of the national economy – without providing anywhere near adequate support to protect lives and livelihoods.\nYou can read my full house column in the Leicester Mercury here.\nYour Member of Parliament working for you across Leicester East\nClaudia Webbe MP, Member of Parliament for Leicester East is responsible for the production of the content of claudiawebbe.org.\nClaudia Webbe MP\nMember of Parliament for Leicester East\nHouse of Commons\nLondon\nSW1A 0AA\nTel: 0207 219 3000\nMobile: 07973 816885\nFreephone: 0800 799 9870\nEmail: [email protected]\n©2021 Copyright Claudia Webbe All rights reserved.\n| Cookie | Duration | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| cookielawinfo-checkbox-analytics | 11 months | This cookie is set by GDPR Cookie Consent plugin.
