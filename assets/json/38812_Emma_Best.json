Fast forward to October 2020 - September 2021 and we’ve seen 473 cases. This represents a percentage increase of just under 250% in five years.\nAgainst a backdrop of lockdowns and social restrictions this is an increase we really need to understand. Is it a case of better reporting? More education perhaps allowing recognition of what spiking is? Or is there an element of evolution in the ease of drugging and availability of drugs with which to spike? Has education worked conversely to also better inform predators through the internet and social media accounts on how to attempt to commit a drugging offence?\nThese are questions we seriously need to answer. For all of us. It is a question of safety not just for women and girls but men too. I still remember the heart wrenching feeling reading of the 200 men attacked by just one offender in Manchester.\nSpiking is a despicable crime in all forms. In London I’m working to get answers and look at how we can better tackle these evil acts. I’m delighted the Home Affairs Committee has also launched their inquiry, we must work together across the country to end the scourge of drugging.\nIf you have any experience of this or have witnessed it then please complete their five minute survey here.",

This shows that not only does this punitive charge putting cleaning air quality on the backs of the poorest Londoners and smallest businesses & charities but it was also is a waste of money.\nNow, Sadiq Khan has set aside £400m to extend the ULEZ even further and look at the feasibility of road charging.\nThis money could scrap every single non-compliant car in the Capital. Why waste money on penalising people when we can instead clean London's Air through helping people as opposed to penalising them.",

  "https_www_emmabest_org_uk_/https_www_emmabest_org_uk_HIVZERO2030/content_14.html": "Zero new infections of HIV & HIV related deaths by 2030 is within sight and has been bolstered by the recently announced £23 million of Government funding which will support the new action plan.\nHowever, to achieve zero new cases and deaths by 2030 will take more than Government funding. It will require commitment and leadership in every corner of the country from both local and regional leaders.\nNowhere is this more critical than in London where there are the highest proportion of HIV diagnoses in England (37% of newly diagnosed cases in 2020).\nFurther action is vital for Londoners. In September Emma asked the Mayor to commit to supporting a campaign encouraging testing by offering up parts of the TfL estate for advertising. At the time he agreed.\nIn September, Emma also proposed a motion to the assembly which made several asks of the Mayor and was unanimously agreed by the GLA.\nThe Mayor of London has now suggested in a written response to this motion that he would not support a campaign on the TfL estate with free advertising as well as making less than encouraging responses to the other asks.\nEmma is calling on the Mayor to reconsider and commit to a campaign for National HIV Testing Week (7 - 13 February). We can end HIV in the near future; but we must do all we can today.\nYou can see Emma’s letter to the Mayor below:\nDear Mr Mayor,\nOn Thursday 2nd September the Assembly unanimously passed a motion recognising the importance of your manifesto pledge to reduce new cases of HIV by 80% by 2025 and entirely by 2030. The motion called for you to:\n- Support opt-out HIV testing across the NHS\n- Support HIV testing at home being made available in all 32 London Boroughs\n- Work with NHS bodies to pilot a trial of PrEP availability beyond sexual health clinics\n- Provide free TfL advertising space to encourage HIV testing and up to date information\n- Make mental health support available to all Londoners living with HIV\nOn that same day I asked you specifically during a TfL Plenary meeting if you'd work with partners to provide a HIV testing campaign on the TfL estate, which you advised you would\nI'm disappointed therefore that in your recent response to my motion you have rescinded this offer and suggested there's no space on the TfL network to provide free advertising to promote testing. This is particularly disappointing qiven the latest HIV stats which show there are approximately 1,650 people living with HIV in London who remain undiagnosed - 35% of all undiagnosed cases across England.\nIn October, through written question 2021/3831, I asked for a details of any TfL advertising spaces which have been qiven away for free but I have not yet received an answer. Given that you can confirm you will not offer further advertising space for HIV testing, you must know which businesses have taken up the allocated free advertising space. I would be very grateful for a prompt response to my question.\nYou'll understand the great multitude of opportunity there is to provide free advertising on the large TfL estate. Indeed, you provided £500k worth of free advertising for a vaginal moisturiser.\nIt follows therefore that there must be room to assist with promotion of HIV testing in the country's most concentrated areas of undiagnosed cases.\nDiagnoses among heterosexuals have also overtaken those of gay and bisexual men (50% v 45% respectively) and so now more than ever an awareness campaign is crucial to achieving no new diagnosis by 2030 with the profile of the HIV epidemic changing.\nLondon as a whole also continues to have the highest proportion of HIV diagnoses in England, with 37% of newly diagnosed cases in 2020. Further action is vital for Londoners.\nI welcome your support for PrEP to be more widely available but take up again relies on increasing knowledge and awareness in diverse populations across the capital. As well as supporting roll-out of PreP in non-clinical settings to assist in take up it is advertising again that will also prove crucial to improving take up.\nThere are a number of other measures where your support is needed such as ensuring the Government's £20m support for opt-out HIV testing in A&E departments in areas of high HIV prevalence is successfully rolled out and encouraging Integrated Care Systems (ICS's) that have yet to commit to opt-out HIV testing to take it up.\nI urge you to look again at providing a campaign through the TfL estate and wider commercial sites to raise awareness of testing and provide stigma busting information.\nNational HIV Testing Week takes place from 7 - 13 February and I implore you to work with TfL to explore how the profile of this vitally important week can be raised. You have committed to showing leadership on HIV but now must act to deliver this.\nYours sincerely,\nEmma Best\nLondonwide Assembly Member\nEmail: [email protected]",

  "https_www_emmabest_org_uk_/https_www_emmabest_org_uk_campaigns_reinstate-night-tube-full/content_23.html": "Emma has been actively campaigning for the reinstatement of the night tube in full after it was suspended due to COVID in March 2020.\nCampaign Timeline:\n- In late December 2021 the RMT announced the longest strike action in the history of the London Underground with a six month walkout across the Central and Victoria lines in relation to argument over the four night shifts asked of workers each year. The push continues to get the worst-strike rate Mayor in London's history to get a grip of negotiations.\n- At December 2021's Mayor's Question Time Emma questioned the Mayor on when an agreed timetable for the reopening of the night tube would be released as he had promised at November's Mayor's Question Time. The Mayor vaguely committed to releasing this information in the new year. Emma also asked for key information that need's to be understood to look at when the night tube can be reopened. How many drivers still need to be trained? How long does the training take and when were COVID restrictions around training lifted? It is also is now apparent that the damaging strike action of the RMT is now not only threatening the running of the night tube but indeed tube travel at all times. Emma asked if the Mayor would look for any further powers (such as a pendulum model) to help in tackling what he describes as unnecessary strikes - the Mayor declined. It has to be time for him to rethink.\n- Shortly before Mayor's Question Time in November 2021 it became apparent that the reopening of the night tube would be in jeopardy due to the all unions except the RMT agreeing to conditions that drivers would be asked work a maximum of four night shifts a year and a resulting walkout planned. Emma sort the clarity needed from the Mayor through an oral update that this would mean the night tube reopening on the Central and Victoria lines would still go ahead but with a less regular service.\n- In November 2021 the Assembly unanimously backed Emma's motion calling for the Mayor to lay out a timetable for the reopening of the night tube in full.\n- In October 2021 the Mayor of London committed to reopening the Central and Victoria lines, however, two lines was simply not enough. Londoners want the night tube back in operation in full. Emma pushed the Mayor to commit to reopening the other lines and laying out clear plans for when he expected to do so.",

However, the developers regularly review design and functionality accessibility on the website platform, including:-\n- Improving layouts and colours to enhance simplicity and contrast\n- Ensuring that text appears in a legible font size\n- Ensuring that tap targets are an accessible size and not too small or close together\n- Considering accessibility in all design and functionality decisions\n- Publishing best practice for website administrators relating to content accessibility\nHow accessible is the website platform?\nDue to the devolved nature of the administration of a website platform, the responsibility for accessibility of content rests with the content creators. The developers are aware of the potential to add or modify content that is not as accessible as it could be, including:-\n- Images used as links\n- Broken links\n- Text as images in some locations, such as infographics and logos, without supportive descriptions\n- Non-optimal images and pdfs, such as scanned letters\n- Some historic images lack alternative text (prior to August 2016, when alt text became mandatory on the platform)\n- Not all videos feature subtitles and/or descriptive text\nThe developers of the website platform have no control over nor can take any responsibility for the content added to the website, but strive to resolve these where possible through aspects of the functionality as well as integral and disseminated best practice. It is entirely possible for all of these accessibility issues to be resolved by content creators themselves.\nBrowser accessibility\nThis website has been optimised for the latest versions of the following browsers:-\n- Google Chrome\n- Mozilla Firefox\n- Apple Safari\n- Microsoft Edge\nIf the website does not display correctly, please update to the latest version of your browser.\nHow to request information in an accessible format\nThis website has its own administrator and if you need information in a different format, please contact that individual using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu. Alternatively, you can write to the address in the footer if one appears.\nReporting accessibility problems\nThis website has its own administrator and if you find any problems that are not listed on this page or if you think the website is not meeting accessibility requirements, please contact the administrator using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu. Alternatively, you can write to the address in the footer if one appears. If necessary, information about structural or design accessibility issues will be passed to the developers to include in the development roadmap.\nIf you contact us with a complaint about accessibility and you are not happy with our response, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).\nFrom time to time, other website developers copy this Accessibility statement for use on their own websites.

  "https_www_emmabest_org_uk_/https_www_emmabest_org_uk_news_food-thought-tfl-junk-food-ban-mayors-failure-tackle-childhood-obesity/content_9.html": "A new report published today exposes the failings of the TfL junk food ad ban and reveals that childhood obesity continues to grow in the capital. The report calls on the Mayor to produce an urgent action plan to address the startling drop in children at a healthy weight.\nThe report, Food For Thought: The TfL Junk Food Ad Ban and the Mayor’s Failure to tackle child obesity in London, published by GLA Conservative Health Spokesperson Emma Best AM, finds that:\n-\nThe advertising ban brought in to tackle childhood obesity has failed.\n-\nThe ban does not stop food such as cheeseburgers being advertised on the network as it had intended to.\n-\nThe one-year review of this policy did not happen and research into the policy’s effectiveness was published two years late in February 2022.\n-\nThe results themselves are misleading as the research did not capture information about food purchased and consumed outside of the home (such as from fast food outlets and restaurants).\n-\nFurther research to capture this data must be conducted to effectively evaluate the policy, the rules governing the ban revisited and an urgent action plan implemented to tackle London’s childhood obesity epidemic.\nEmma Best, London Wide Assembly Member comments:\n“Childhood obesity in London is rising, both in reception and year 6 children. The TfL junk food ad ban was specifically designed as a “groundbreaking measure” to tackle childhood obesity and it has not worked.\nThe health of our children is too important to pretend that it has. We cannot celebrate false ‘wins’ of the ban when it has not even slightly solved the problem. Especially as the study cited as proving the ban’s effectiveness, does not cover the purchase and consumption of fast foods from restaurants and takeaways, consumed outside of the home, and instead relies on dodgy metrics to justify any positive results.\nIf the Mayor wants to pursue this policy, he needs to urgently review the advertising criteria used to enforce the ban. More importantly he must take urgent action on proven strategies to improve the health of London’s children.”"
