Undoubtedly this will highlight mistakes, process weaknesses and circumstances which I hope will provide critical learning.\nYet we also recognise that these individual enquiries will likely focus on how each agency acted and not necessarily how they interacted. They are also squarely focused on a specific case.\nIf we are to find answers to the real change necessary to protect our communities from a repeat incident then a whole system review is needed.\nThe UK charity Hundred Families reports that on average 120 families a year are bereaved as a result of mental health homicides in the UK each year - around 20% of the total number of unlawful killings in the country each year.\nUnfortunately the case in Nottingham appears not to be an isolated one.",

Alex’s partner, Emma Foody, is also standing for Parliament, as the Labour\ncandidate for Cramlington and Killingworth in Northumberland.\nThis means that on the 4th July all four candidates will be standing in the same election, and for three of them, in the same county.\nSpeaking after her selection, Caroline Henry stated:\n“When we moved to our forever home in Kimberley it was in the Broxtowe constituency but following the new boundary changes it will be in the Nottingham North and Kimberley constituency. I love this area and its people, so it really matters\nto me that we have a local champion representing us in Parliament.\n“It is not easy putting yourself out there and being a politician and my plans this summer were just to play with our new Puppy - called Pickle. However, I am a strong woman, no nonsense, genuine and I get stuff done to help others so I felt it was my duty to stand up and serve my community again.\n“I know what it takes to serve local people and take action on issues that really matter to communities.\n“My experience as Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner has given me a deep understanding of the challenges our communities face and the importance of effective leadership.\n“From making Nottinghamshire safer to ensuring that public services like policing are more accessible, I have consistently fought to improve the quality of life for our residents.\n“Now, as a candidate for Parliament, my commitment is to the people of Nottingham North and Kimberley.\n“If elected, I will dedicate myself to addressing their needs, championing local causes, and working tirelessly to bring positive change and prosperity to our community.”",

I hope it shows the public that we’ve got their back whenever they have the misfortune to be affected by crime.\n“Not only is Nottinghamshire Police successfully reducing crime, but we have a range of fantastic support services that help people recover from the after-effects of crime when they need help.\n“I’d like to thank Catch 22 for all of the incredible work they have done running the Nottinghamshire Victim CARE service for us and we look forward to building on and expanding this service even further with our new service providers Remedi from October 1.\n“The last year was a significant year in which I appointed a new Chief Constable, Kate Meynell, and I’m really pleased with the work she has done so far not only in preventing and responding to crime strengthening the force’s engagement with the community.\n“There have been some challenges in recent times to the public confidence in policing nationally. But I believe the work that is happening locally will help to rebuild this trust.\n“Recently, the tragic multiple homicide in Nottingham in June 2023 and the death in service of Sergeant Graham Saville in August 2023 sent shockwaves through the community. Both served as important reminders of the bravery, professionalism and sacrifice shown by our officers on a daily basis as they work to keep Nottinghamshire residents safe.”",
