This ensures they play League 1 football for the first time since 2015 next season.\nZack joined over 16,000 spectators who travelled to Wembley to support the team and see them win. With fans also turning out at Broadfield Stadium on Monday evening to show their appreciation for the team's efforts.\nZack said, \"Its brilliant news for the club and for the town. The Red Devils have not been in League One since 2015 and this will put Crawley on the map. I look forward to the team's continued success\".",
  "https_www_zackali_uk_/https_www_zackali_uk_news_zack-ali-says-only-conservatives-have-clear-plan-give-young-people-crawley-opportunities-they/content_16.html": "The Conservatives want young people to secure the best opportunities with a good well-paid job, which means we need to crack down on university degrees which make people poorer at the expense of the taxpayer. That is why the Conservatives have set out a clear plan to deliver 100,000 more apprenticeships per year by the end of the next parliament, funded by changing the law to close the poorest performing university courses. This will make sure the Conservatives continue with the rollout of their successful apprenticeship programme which has seen over 5.8 million people get the skills and opportunities they deserve since 2010. This bold action will ensure young people have the skills they need to get good, secure jobs. Labour would halve the number of apprenticeships and take young people back to square one.\nZack Ali has welcomed the Conservatives’ clear plan to deliver 100,000 more high-skilled apprenticeships a year by the end of the next parliament to secure a brighter future for young people across Crawley. This will be done by replacing the worst performing university courses with high-skilled apprenticeships.\nThe UK is home to four of the top ten universities globally, which play a significant role in boosting local economies. However, too many university degrees are leaving students worse off and saddled with debt.\nThat is why the Conservatives will assess the poorest performing university courses based on their drop-out rates, job progression and future earnings potential and replace these with high-skilled apprenticeships so our young people can learn the skills they need to reach their full potential.\nSince 2010, the Conservatives have created a world-class apprenticeship system that has delivered 5.8 million apprenticeships and now reaches nearly 70 per cent of all occupations.\nThe choice is clear: stick with the Conservatives under Rishi Sunak who have built a world-class apprenticeship system from the ground up and are securing the future of our young people alongside our National Service plan. Or go back to square one with Labour, who would slash apprenticeships in half across the country, denying young people of the opportunities they deserve and taking us back to square one.\nZack Ali said:\n“Only the Conservatives have a clear plan to give young people in Crawley the opportunities they deserve for a more secure future.\n“Building on the delivery of 5.8 million apprenticeships since 2010, I am delighted that the Conservatives have now gone further by setting out a clear plan to deliver 100,000 new apprenticeships per year, helping young people to gain the valuable life skills they need for a more secure future alongside our National Service plan.\n“All of this would be at risk under Labour, who would slash apprenticeship starts by 10,020 across the South East, taking us back to square one.”\nRishi Sunak, Prime Minister said:\n“Improving education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet for boosting life chances. So, it’s not fair that some university courses are ripping young people off.\n“Thanks to our plan, apprenticeships are much higher quality than they were under Labour. And now we will create 100,000 more, by putting an end to rip-off degrees and offering our young people the employment opportunities and financial security they need to thrive.\n“That’s the choice at this election – the Conservatives with our clear plan to grow the economy and give people the opportunities they need for a secure future, or Labour who have no plan and would take us back to square one.”\nGillian Keegan, Education Secretary said:\n“There are no limits to where an apprenticeship can take you. Mine took me from a car factory in Kirkby to the Cabinet.\n“When Labour were in power they pushed an arbitrary target to get half of young people to university, creating a boom in low quality degrees – leaving far too many students saddled with debt and little else.\n“The choice is clear. Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour party who have contempt for apprenticeships, or Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives who have a clear plan to give young people the best start to their careers.”",
  "https_www_zackali_uk_/https_www_zackali_uk_news_labours-tuition-fee-hike-shocking-betrayal-students-and-families-says-cllr-zack-ali/content_33.html": "Cllr. Zack Ali has condemned the recent decision by the Labour Government to raise tuition fees, calling it a “betrayal of students’ trust and families’ finances.” The increase, announced by Labour’s Education Secretary, means students will face an additional £285 per year—despite Labour’s prior promises to freeze or even reduce these fees.\nDuring his leadership campaign, the Labour Prime Minister pledged to end tuition fees altogether. More recently, Labour’s ministers assured the public there were “no plans” to raise fees. But now, with this announcement, Labour has turned its back on these commitments, making higher education even more costly for young people across the country.\nLabour claims this increase is essential to address university funding shortages, but Cllr. Ali argues that such claims ignore the real issues. “Our young people are already struggling with the rising costs of living,” he said. “Instead of keeping their promise to make education more accessible, Labour has imposed yet another financial burden on students and their families.”\nThe Labour tuition fee hike, which kicks in from April 2025, will see graduates saddled with even more debt upon entering the workforce. Cllr. Ali warns that Crawley’s families and young people will feel the brunt of this decision.\nCommenting on the announcement, Cllr. Zack Ali said:\n“Labour’s tuition fee hike is a stark reminder of their failure to keep their promises. Crawley’s students and families deserve a government that will support their ambitions, not one that saddles them with additional debt. Instead of honouring their pledge to make education more affordable, Labour has added yet another financial burden to our young people, who are already facing record costs of living. This is more than a policy failure, which shows once again that Labour cannot be trusted to act in the best interests of hard-working Britons, it will worsen trust between politicians and the public.”",

  "https_www_zackali_uk_/https_www_zackali_uk_news_zack-ali-welcomes-new-triple-lock-plus-cut-taxes-pensioners-across-crawley/content_28.html": "Zack has welcomed the Conservatives’ new Triple Lock Plus, cutting taxes for pensioners across Crawley and guaranteeing people will never pay income tax on their State Pension.\nAfter committing to protect the Triple Lock earlier this year, the Conservatives will go further to boost pensioners’ incomes if they win the next election. In addition to uprating the State Pension in line with the highest of prices,earnings, or 2.5 per cent, the tax-free personal allowance for pensioners will also rise by the Triple Lock – guaranteeing that the State Pension is always below the tax-free threshold.\nThis means that pensioners will never pay income tax on their State Pension, as the Conservatives continue to deliver on their clear plan to provide dignity and security in retirement.\nAs a result of the Triple Lock Plus, the average pensioner will see an increase in the State Pension of £428 next year alongside an income tax cut of £95. By the end of the Parliament, it will be a boost of £1,677 a year to their pension and further £275 a year tax cut.\nThe Triple Lock Plus builds on the Conservative Government’s strong track record of protecting people who worked hard all their lives after their retirement.\nThe Conservatives first introduced the Triple Lock in 2011, which has seen the State Pension increase by more than £3,700 since they entered office – which is £990 more than if it had been uprated by prices, and £1,000 more than if it had been uprated by earnings since 2010.\nMeanwhile Labour have refused to back the Triple Lock Plus and would oversee the State Pension be dragged into income tax for the first time in history if they entered government.\nOnly Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan to support pensioners and will take the bold action needed to deliver financial security and dignity in retirement. Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour would tax pensioners more, taking them back to square one.\nZack Ali, Parliamentary Candidate for Crawley said:\n“The Conservatives will always look after people who worked hard all their lives to provide dignity and security to pensioners in retirement, and the Triple Lock we introduced in 2011 is proof of that.\n“We have already increased that State Pension by £3,700 since 2010 and I am delighted that our new Triple Lock Plus will guarantee that pensioners in Crawley will never have to pay income tax on their State Pension.\n“Only the Conservatives have a clear plan for pensioners and will take bold action to protect them and deliver security in retirement. Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour Party betrayed pensioners before and would do it again.”\nMel Stride, Pensions Secretary, said:\n“A Conservative government is the only one which can provide pensioners the peace of mind in retirement they deserve.\n“Labour’s record speaks for itself. The last Labour government waged an all-out assault on pensioners, with a £118 billion pensions tax raid and an insulting 75p increase to the state pension.\n“Sir Keir Starmer can pay lip service to pensioners until he’s blue in the face, but we know it will always be the same old Labour, putting our pensioners at the back of the queue.”",

The Emergency Budget is not a plan – it is an admission of failure, and a direct result of the economic chaos created in Downing Street.\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has confirmed the consequences of Labour’s reckless choices. Under Rachel Reeves, the economic outlook has sharply deteriorated, leaving working people in Crawley to pay the price.\n- Growth cut in half. Forecast GDP growth for 2025 has collapsed from two per cent to just one per cent, with the OBR citing structural weakness in the economy - much of it driven by poor productivity and falling business confidence.\n- Inflation rising again. CPI inflation is now expected to rise to 3.2 per cent this year - more than double the forecast level when the Conservatives left office in 2024 and above the Bank of England's target.\n- No growth in living standards. Real GDP per person remains below pre-pandemic levels, with households facing stagnant wages, rising prices and higher taxes.\nCommenting, Cllr Zack Ali, Parliamentary Spokesman for Crawley said:\n“Since the Chancellor’s first disastrous Budget, she has placed our country on a path of economic destruction by introducing a Jobs’ Tax, piling up borrowing and destroying growth.\n“And the consequences of her choices are now clear – and it is the hard-working people of Crawley that will be left to pay the price.\n“I will continue to do what is right by all in Crawley and fight these measures every step of the way.”\nCommenting, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Mel Stride said:\n“Labour inherited the fastest-growing economy in the G7 — and in just months, they’ve brought it to a standstill. Growth halved, inflation rising, taxes at record highs, and unemployment on the up.\n“The British people are working harder, paying more, and getting less. This isn’t stability — its economic chaos created by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.\n\"Under new leadership, the Conservatives will hold this failing Labour Government to account and stand up for families across the country who are being punished by the Chancellor’s decisions.”",

  "https_www_zackali_uk_/https_www_zackali_uk_news_labours-budget-broken-promises-hits-working-families-record-tax-hikes/content_13.html": "Cllr Zack Ali has condemned the recent Labour budget, calling it a “devastating betrayal” of the promises Labour made to British families, workers, and small businesses. The Autumn Budget, announced by Labour’s Chancellor Rachel Reeves, raises taxes to unprecedented levels, costing each working family £2,237 more annually, and brings in a staggering £40 billion in new taxes—despite Labour’s repeated pledges not to increase the tax burden on ordinary working people.\nDuring the election campaign, Labour assured the public that taxes on working people would remain untouched. They pledged not to raise National Insurance, income tax, or VAT. Yet, with this budget, Labour has increased employers National Insurance and the independent Institute of Fiscal Studies has said it will be paid for by workers. This change alone represents a £25 billion tax raid on working families and small businesses, disproportionately impacting lower-paid workers.\nThe Independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that Labour’s employer National Insurance increase will reduce job opportunities and hit wages. The OBR estimates a reduction equivalent to 50,000 jobs, and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that these increases will disproportionately impact lower-income families.\nAlongside tax hikes, Labour’s budget includes a dramatic change to fiscal rules, allowing for unprecedented borrowing. This change, called “fiscal fiddling” by the IFS, means Labour has effectively moved the goalposts, using altered fiscal standards to justify billions more in borrowing. Economists are concerned that this borrowing surge will drive up interest rates and keep inflation high, adding even more pressure on household budgets.\nLabour’s budget places Britain’s tax burden at 38.2% of GDP by 2028. This tax-and-spend agenda, combined with additional regulations on businesses, is expected to suppress private investment and stymie growth across the economy.\nCommenting, Cllr Zack Ali, Conservative Spokesman for Crawley said:\n“Labour’s budget is a devastating betrayal of trust. They promised to protect working people, yet they’ve delivered the highest tax burden in history. Ordinary families in Crawley now face an extra £2,237 a year in costs, while our local businesses, farmers, and job creators are left to pay the price of Labour’s broken promises. This budget is proof that Labour cannot be trusted to act in the interests of hard-working Britons.”",

This will ensure that millions more hours of patrolling can be targeted in the worst affected areas. Where this is already in place, there has been a huge increase in enforcement, and up to 50 percent decrease in anti-social behaviour.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said:\n“Everyone has the right to feel safe in their neighbourhood and a sense of pride in the place they call home.\n“The Conservatives are the only ones with a clear plan to ensure safety, security and prosperity in your local community and your high street.\n“We will take the action needed to crack down on fly-tipping, evict nuisance tenants and stop anti-social behaviour in its tracks so we can build a secure future for everyone across the whole country.”\nZack Ali, Conservative candidate for Crawley, said:\n“I welcome these plans from the Prime Minister.\n“We know how anti-social behaviour is a scourge on communities here and as Conservatives we will do whatever we can to stop it.\n“These measures are part of a clear vision to show those criminals their behaviour will not be tolerated.\n“I know how much pride people have in Crawley and these plans will ensure everyone living and working here will be able to feel ever prouder about our fine town.”",

More?\n- Will taxes go up or services be cut to pay for it?\n- Will defence cuts be made to cover this staggering cost?\nAt a time when Labour is slapping higher taxes on hard-working families and cutting winter fuel payments for pensioners, how can they justify an eye-watering sum to lease back land that Britain already owns?\nAnd crucially, does this set a dangerous precedent for other UK military bases like Cyprus?\nThis is a betrayal of Britain’s national security, taxpayers, and strategic interests. If Labour thinks this is such a good deal, let them defend it. But they won’t because they know they have sold out Britain.\nMoreover, the Chagossian community in the UK, many of whom were forcibly removed from their homeland decades ago, feel sidelined by this agreement.

But there is more to do. That is why the Conservatives will expand Pharmacy First to other conditions, and build or modernise 250 GP surgeries and build 50 new Community Diagnostic Centres across England, so that patients in Crawley can access the NHS more conveniently for them, whilst reducing pressure on hospitals. Under the Conservatives, the plan is working and we must stick to it to make progress on improving access to primary care and cutting NHS waiting lists. Labour’s record speaks for itself, where Labour are in power in Wales, patients face the longest hospital waits in Great Britain, putting patients at risk because they have no plan to clear the backlog.\nZack Ali has welcomed the Conservatives’ clear plan to boost access to deliver even more out-of-hospital GP, pharmacy, and community diagnostic centres so patients across Crawley can access the care when they need it, more quickly.\nThe existing Pharmacy First scheme, which allows patients to get treatment from their local pharmacy without needing to visit a GP, has been a great success with 98 per cent of pharmacies signed up. Building on this success, the Conservatives have pledged to expand Pharmacy First to allow for treatment of other conditions, including offering women more contraceptive options and menopause support, and providing treatment for acne and chest infections – freeing up 20 million GP appointments in total.\nThe Conservatives have also pledged to build 100 new GP surgeries and modernise 150 more, focusing on the areas of greatest need, particularly those experiencing new housing growth. This new infrastructure will support the Conservatives’ ambition to grow the general practice workforce and offer more care in the community outside of secondary care settings, ultimately keeping more patients out of hospital when they do not need to be there.\nThe Conservatives will also build 50 new Community Diagnostic Centres, on top of the 160 already built in this Parliament, to deliver a further 2.5 million checks and diagnostic tests a year once scaled.\nWhere Labour are in power, patients suffer as a result of the longest hospital waits in Great Britain, putting patients at risk because they have no plan to clear the backlog.\nBy sticking to the plan, the Conservatives have ensured that record numbers can see their GP, achieved the manifesto commitment to deliver 50 million additional appointments each year in General Practice, and increased the number of health professionals working in primary care by almost 40,000.\nZack Ali said:\n“The pandemic put huge pressure on our NHS services in Crawley and as we continue with recovery, it is essential that patients receive the care they need, quickly and easily, which is why I was delighted when the Conservatives launched Pharmacy First.\n“Building on this great success, the Conservatives have announced a clear plan to deliver even more out-of-hospital services across the country by expanding Pharmacy First, build or modernise GP surgeries and invest in new Community Diagnostic Centres.\n“We are sticking with the plan to improve access to care and cut NHS waiting lists so that everyone can access the treatment they need, when they need it.”\nHealth Secretary, Victoria Atkins, said:\n“Pharmacies, GPs and Community Diagnostic Centres are the backbone of our NHS. Because of bold action we have taken, they are more accessible in more places for more people.\n\"I know just how important it is for people to have access to health services and treatment close to home - and Pharmacy First and our hundreds of new Community Diagnostic Centres have been a real success story so far. But we must do more.\n“Our clear plan will continue to enable our brilliant pharmacists, GPs and CDCs to do what they do best: serving their local community and boosting capacity in our NHS.

Labour promised to support families with the cost of living but all of these increases create higher costs for families.\nThese price rises are yet another broken promise at the hands of a Labour Chancellor who is mismanaging the economy, with the British people paying for the privilege.\nCommenting, Cllr Zack Ali, Conservative Parliamentary Spokesman for Crawley said:\n“This is Rachel’s Cruel Day as families in Crawley are forced to pay the price for Labour’s economic chaos.\n“From Council Tax to water bill rises, families simply cannot afford this Labour Government.\n“People should not be forced to pay more for Labour’s choices. Only the Conservatives will remain on the side of hardworking families in Crawley.”\nCommenting, Mel Stride, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer said:\n“Today [1 April] hard-working families across the country will see their cost of living rise yet again — and it's all thanks to this Labour government’s choices.\n“A whole litany of household bills is set to soar, with some increases running into the hundreds of pounds. Whether it’s council tax, energy, water, broadband or car tax, almost every corner of family life is about to get more expensive.\n“Yes, these bill hikes may come into force on April Fools’ Day, but there’s nothing funny about what Labour is doing to the country.”"
