It can be neighbours being anti-social.\nIt can be theft from our local shops. On urban estates, drug dealing is often highly visible. Much goes unreported because wait times on the phone are too long. People give up and hang up.\nIt can be because police do not come out for what they consider low level crime.\nResponse times, when they happen, are too long.\nIt can be that the complainant reports, for example, a drug drop, but sees no follow up action.\nLocal communities report they have lost trust in the police- as a service-not in the individuals.\nSo, there is a lot of under reporting.\nLocal crime has a negative impact on community. It undermines the social fabric.\nOur sense of community and our sense of safety in community is compromised.\nThe more local crime there is, the more there is the fear of crime. Fear of crime attracts crime since areas of high crime is where community relationships are weaker. We learn to distrust each other. Distrust spreads and leaves a cultural vacuum that is filled by criminals.\nIn Northamptonshire, covering 914 square miles and policing a diverse population of over 747,000, Northamptonshire Police employ over 1,501 police officers across the county.\nThis is one police officer per 498 people.\nNationally, after reaching a high of 172,000 officers in 2010, the number of police officers in the UK fell to just 150,000 officers by 2017.\nAlthough that trend has reversed since this point, there were still approximately 8,000 fewer police officers in 2022 than there were twelve years earlier. And the ratio of police per head of population is still much lower than in 2010.\nThe International Association of Chiefs of Police suggests 3.4 officers for every 1000 residents.\nThis would mean 2,615 police for Northamptonshire.\nThese figures do not take into account the drop in PCSOs and Specials. PCSOs are not warranted. However, they provide a really important service in preventing crime, in tackling low level crime, and making all of us feel safer. A recent local survey suggests PCSOs are popular and valued in our neighbourhoods.\nNorthamptonshire is among the top 20 most dangerous counties in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The overall crime rate in Northamptonshire in 2022 was 85 crimes per 1,000 people, and the most common crimes were violence and sexual offences, which happened roughly to every 41 out of 1,000 residents.\nWhat do local people say they want.\nThey want to see more visible policing. More PCSOs, more accessible PCs -on the street, in the shopping areas, and definitely not in vehicles behind glass.\nAnd I agree.",

Organised gangs are entering the stores, taking expensive items off the shelves and walking out. When challenged, the criminals are often abusive and threatening to staff and issue racist and misogynistic threats. The police advise they won’t come out for the theft of goods under £200.\nThey just do not have the staff. Much of this crime is going unreported. Yet, the figures we have are truly alarming.\nLast year there were 1,300 reported incidences a day. Nationally, in the 12 months to September 2023, there were 402,482.\nRetailers have been forced to employ different methods to frustrate the thieves-not having so much stock out, employing security guards, tagging the stock, using body cams. All this adds to costs of course, which is passed on to the consumer. Add the cost-of-living crisis and inflation, and we have a perfect storm.\nRetailers are losing an estimated 3.3 billion a year, through prevention costs and the loss of commodities.\nThe front-line staff are experiencing worsening conditions at work with abuse, threatening behaviours and assault becoming common. Retail work is often the first work experience young people have. This is not a good introduction to the world of work and to adult life.\nThis behaviour should not be tolerated. We want retail workers to feel safe in the workplace. We need the police to have data that allows them to understand the scale of the issue, and to allocate sufficient resources to deal with it. We must ensure all retail workers have the same protection under the law as they do in Scotland, where a similar offence was introduced in 2021.\nWhat needs to be done?\nWe need a Labour Government to bring in a law that makes the abuse of retail staff a specific crime.\nWe need a Labour Police Fire and Crime Commissioner to bring back neighbourhood policing.\nWe need fairer funding from government, so we can have more PCSOs and more PCs working in our communities, to help stop crime happening.",

YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS\nAs a data subject, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.\nRight of access\nYou may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a “subject access request“).\nWe follow the ICO’s “Subject Access Code of Practice” when dealing with requests for access to personal data. You can read this code by visiting https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2014223/subject-access-code-of-practice.pdf.\nPlease note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to or contain your personal data.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at danielle@daniellestone.co.uk and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to rectification and erasure\nYou may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be forgotten“).\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.\nYou can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at danielle@daniellestone.co.uk and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to restrict processing\nWhere we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the sections of this privacy policy which explain how and why we use your information), you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.\nYou may also ask us to stop processing your personal data: (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us to verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; or (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nPlease note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at danielle@daniellestone.co.uk and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.\nYour right to portability\nWhere you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.\nBecause of the kind of the nature of our work do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party, we are happy to consider such requests in good faith.\nYour right to stop receiving communications\nAs noted above, where we send you email marketing communications (or other regulated electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time. You can do this by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link that appears in the footer of each communication (or the equivalent mechanism in those communications).\nAlternatively, if for any reason you cannot use those links, or if you would prefer to contact us directly – you can unsubscribe by contacting us at danielle@daniellestone.co.uk and telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.\nYour right to object to automated decision making and profiling\nYou have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.\nExercising your rights\nWhen you write to us making a request to exercise your rights, we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID documents to help us to verify your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\nIt will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information, then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case, we will tell you).\nYou will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one (1) month. However, it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you of this and keep you updated.\n16. RIGHT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO is the supervisory body authorised by the Data Protection Act 2018 to regulate the handling of personal data within the United Kingdom.\nThe contact details for the ICO are:\n- Information Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF\n- Telephone: 0303 123 1113\n- Website: https://ico.org.uk/concerns/\nLast updated: 27/12/2022",

However, he is not popular. He has disgraced his office. His latest disgrace is calling his newly appointed Fire Chief a bitch! Nikki Watson has yet to take up her position, as she is under investigation by the IOPC. The Chief Constable is suspended on full pay while being investigated by two police services!\nChiefs of both services, Police and Fire, are interims.\nThere have been 5 appointments to both posts over the last 8 years. This instability has had a deeply negative impact on staff morale.\nI am optimistic that, with hard work, come 2nd May, Labour will win.\nI come with a life-long experience of community activism. As a former County education officer, I know the patch from Corby to Brackley well. I have been a Labour Councillor for 13 years.\nThe combination of community activism and public service is a really strong base from which to challenge the Tories.\nI argued against the transfer of the Fire and Rescue Service to the OPCC when I was a County Councillor. I could see it meant service cuts, as has indeed been the case. As Commissioner, I am committed to a review of the structure, governance and resource base of both the Police and the Fire Service. They must both be run for the public good. I want to see zero based budgets where we cost what is good to outstanding. I want to compare that with what budgets we have. I want to fight for the difference between the two.\nI also want clear boundaries for each service. A police officer cannot step into fire-fighter’s shoes. And vice versa. Where the services work together-as in extreme weather events, or road traffic accidents then there must be jointly produced operational protocols in place.\nNorthamptonshire is among the top 20 most dangerous counties in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The overall crime rate in Northamptonshire in 2023 was 85 crimes per 1,000 people. The crime rate in the United Kingdom was 75.88 per 1,000 people in 2022–2023.\nYears of disinvestment in youth has made them vulnerable to grooming by gangs and to knife crime. We see a distressingly high rate of fatalities and serious injury in Northants. Supporting quality youth provision is a high priority.\nFront line retail staff are often subject to abuse and witness high levels of organised theft. More visible policing with better response times is essential.\nWomen and girls tell me they feel unsafe at home, in school, at work, in their own neighbourhoods. Creating safer environments and public spaces can be done. I will resource prevention, education and support for both services.\nI will have a strategy for the decarbonisation of vehicles and buildings.\nLastly, our community safety partnerships need strengthening and need to be accountable. Meetings should be held in public, and milestones and targets published and reviewed.\nI am campaigning across the county, talking with community groups and households in our urban centres and in our rural areas.\nEverywhere I go, people are telling me the same thing. Life is tough and getting tougher.\nNo-one feels safe. Everything we hold dear is broken. It is time for change. I hope the people of Northamptonshire register to vote. I hope they have a postal vote or if going to the polling station remember to take ID. Change is coming. We need to make sure it is the change we need.",

It is particularly bad in Northamptonshire, where we are rated as one of the 20 least safe areas in England and Wales.\nWith violent and sexual crimes men make up the majority of perpetrators.\nWe clearly need to change the culture of entitlement that boys grow up in.\nWhat are the unmet needs men have, that cause them to behave badly? Are they real needs or culturally bound needs? What must society do to ensure we have generations of kind, reflective, productive men?\nThis is an issue when the police force itself and many partner organisations exhibit the culture of white male entitlement, which breeds misogyny, homophobia and racism. It is a culture that affects all of us.\nSo, for example, little girls are brought up to be “men pleasers”, with dire consequences if they fail at that task-name calling, being graded 1-10 by school boys, assaulted etc.\nGirls who do comply, are also attacked and name called, for not being attractive enough, for being too available, not available enough. We have a serious problem with sexual violence in our schools.\nResponses to Domestic Abuse seem to prioritise the perpetrators-usually men. This is driven by funding. Femicide and gender-based violence is a global issue. https://www.womankind.org.uk/resource/a-femicide-factsheet-global-stats-calls-to-action/\nCourt delays make victimhood a prolonged and traumatising affair.\nDisinvestment in probation means that violent men are released from prison without adequate support to make the changes they need, in order to live an abuse free life, leaving women and children, and other men, at risk.\nThe Family Courts scandal regarding giving abusive men access to their children is the outcome of deep-seated misogyny in the system.\nRed flags, like up-skirting, are dismissed as trivial, when in actual fact they are deeply abusive and if unchecked lead to even greater violent and sexual crimes.\nThe majority of the 2.9 million lone-parent families in 2022 were headed by a lone mother (2.5 million, 84%), with lone fathers now accounting for 16% (457,000) of lone-parent families.\nThese women often face the issues of serious violent crime either as victims or mothers of perpetrators. No regard is given to the enormous job they do on our behalf. The system belittles women, belittles mothers and leaves our children insecure and vulnerable as a result.\nFor children to become good citizens they have to have their needs met. This cannot be done in nuclear families alone. This is not about bad parenting. It takes a village to rear a child.\nWhat are the current unmet needs?\nBabies and toddlers need the chance to socialise, and develop trust, in trust worthy networks of children and adults.\nSchool age children need to have opportunities for informal social networks and activities outside of school.\nYouth need safe spaces to socialise, stretching activities, opportunities to test themselves, informal learning, work experience.\nWe need investment in our young.\nParents need responsive and timely support during pregnancy and after birth and continuing access to support throughout their parenting.",

He has made four appointments to the Role of Chief of Fire and Rescue just in the last 12 months. His most recent appointment Nikki Watson cannot take up her post because she is under investigation by the IOPC. Both services have interim chiefs. This is very under-minding of services struggling to provide excellent services, to build trust with the public, to recruit and retain staff and to improve staff morale. In July he tried to shoehorn his very good friend Nicci Marzec into the role of Fire chief. He has betrayed his office further by making misogynistic remarks about Nikki Watson.\nIt is right that he has been forced to step down as a candidate in the forth coming election on May 2nd for the Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Commissioner.\nWe need a change. I am standing as commissioner because I want to restore integrity and trust in that office. I want to work across the county with local authorities and other organisations to reduce crime, to make our streets safe and our communities strong."
