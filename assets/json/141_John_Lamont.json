Any loss of direct transport to the Borders is another missed opportunity for our economy.\n“Nevertheless, it is welcome that there will be more journeys on a Saturday making it easier for day trippers and tourists to come to our area. This will be especially important with the Great Tapestry opening in Galashiels.\n“It should also ease congestion on the route when there is rugby and other national events in the capital.\n“I urge all users of the Borders Railway to take a look at the proposed timetable and respond to the Scotrail consultation.\n“I will be meeting with Scotrail in due course to discuss the changes.”\nRachael Hamilton MSP said:\n“Although it is concerning to see some services being cut beyond Edinburgh, I have long campaigned for more trains at the weekend and glad to see they will be put in place from May 2022.\n“Too often we have seen overcrowded trains to and from Tweedbank especially when there are events in Edinburgh. Many of the last trains can be packed as well so extra capacity is welcome.\n“Clearly, to ensure the success of public transport services, they rely on as many commuters as possible getting back to their desks”\n“Regardless, an effective transport system needs to be in place to help us build back greener and better from the pandemic.”",

  "https_www_johnlamont_org_/https_www_johnlamont_org_news_small-businesses-let-down-labour-and-snp/content_30.html": "Small family businesses are struggling through some of the hardest times they have ever faced at the moment.\nThe economy has taken a turn for the worse since the UK Labour government's first budget last autumn.\nBefore they assumed office, inflation was already high in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, which drove up energy prices.\nThe country's finances were just starting to recover when they were rocked by the decisions in Labour's budget, including the raising of national insurance and the introduction of a Family Farm Tax.\nThose taxes not only broke promises that had been made to voters prior to last year's General Election. They have also forced businesses to rethink plans to hire additional workers, invest more in equipment or seek to expand their business.\nI believe the changes have hit businesses the hardest in small towns and rural areas. In other words, the impact has been most severe in the very places we call home here in the Borders.\nWe have lots of small family businesses operating in this area, from farmers to food producers to other enterprises that act as critical components of the rural economy.\nIn turn, these businesses employ lots of local people and allow many other companies to thrive, including the small shops on our high streets, hospitality premises that cater to local workers, and the many services we all rely on regularly.\nThe consequences for our economy are so troubling that I have been doing everything in my power to convince Labour to change direction.\nMost recently, in a speech to the House of Commons, I urged the UK government to abandon the Family Farm Tax policy.\nIf it goes ahead, as seems likely, Labour's decision will force the break up of many family farms, increase the price of food in shops, put food security at risk, and harm the environment as we are forced to rely on costly foreign imports.\nBut, regrettably, it seems the policy is going ahead. The National Farmers Union recently met with the government and afterwards, the union said they were \"very disappointed\" by Labour's \"dismissive\" and \"bewildering\" approach.\nHowever, that won't stop me from standing up to this plan and continuing to push for change. If it will impact your business, please get in touch with my office and I will be happy to help however I can.",

This is the preferred route of Scottish Borders Council and the Campaign for Borders Rail and is protected within the council’s Local Development Plan (LDP).\nHowever, the Scottish Government has thrown the extension plans into disarray after attempting to remove the protections within the LDP.\nCouncil papers, due for debate on Thursday 10th March, reveal that the ‘Scottish Government seek removal of any indication of a preferred route for a railway extension from Tweedbank to Carlisle via Hawick.’\nHowever, Conservative led Scottish Borders Council have revealed that they will be defying the request.\nJohn Lamont MP said:\n“This is an absolute bombshell for the future of this project and calls into question SNP support for the extension to Hawick and Newcastleton.\n“Scottish Conservatives at Borders Council are absolutely right to refuse this request and I hope that all councillors from all parties will take the same stance.\n“For the Borders Railway to truly live up to its name it needs to be extended to serve Hawick and Newcastleton before arriving in Carlisle.\n“I am urging the Scottish and UK governments to push on and get the feasibility study done as soon as possible.

  "https_www_johnlamont_org_/https_www_johnlamont_org_news_why-we-must-extend-borders-railway/content_27.html": "One of the most pressing issues facing Borders residents is the lack of access to reliable and efficient public transport.\nI am regularly contacted by local people who believe, as I do, that we must improve the local transport infrastructure and especially the availability of rail services for many communities.\nI have been working hard alongside local campaign groups to achieve a better rail service for the Borders.\nOf all the improvements that could be made, I believe the biggest economic benefits in terms of jobs and business growth would come from extending the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and onto Carlisle. That extension has the potential to bring enormous benefits to local communities across the area.\nThe Borders Railway, as you know, has been a tremendous success since it was reopened in 2015, connecting our towns and villages to Edinburgh and the wider rail network. It has boosted tourism, encouraged investment, and made it easier for people to commute to work and access essential services.\nBut I think it would be a mistake to settle for what we have now, when more benefits would flow to our local area if we achieve that addition of the service onto Hawick, Newcastleton and Carlisle.\nMany places in the Borders have been held back by subpar transport links. The lack of rail connections often makes it difficult for people to travel around cheaply and easily.\nBy extending the Borders Railway to Hawick, we can address these issues and unlock the full potential of the area. The benefits are clear. Businesses will be better connected to markets and customers, residents will have easier access to services, and tourists will be able to explore more of the beautiful Borders.\nAlthough I am firmly of the view that people in the Borders need their cars to live and work, there is no doubt that a more connected railway and bus service would benefit our environment too. For those seeking to reach net zero climate targets, better public transport links would certainly help.\nOf course, this project will have its challenges.

  "https_www_johnlamont_org_/https_www_johnlamont_org_news_bringing-bills-down-essential-economic-growth/content_32.html": "By John Lamont MP\nIt's not often that the actions of the President of the United States have a direct impact on the Scottish Borders.\nBut that rare event happened recently when Donald Trump introduced a sweeping range of tariffs on countries all over the world.\nHowever you feel about the President, the tariffs he has introduced will be damaging for businesses and economic growth.\nThere will be serious consequences for businesses in the Borders who export and sell their products abroad.\nSadly, the pain will also be felt beyond those businesses. It's likely that the costs for consumers will be felt on a whole range of products and the risk of recession could put jobs at risk and force people out of business.\nIt is terrible timing because in Scotland and across the whole UK, our economy is already faltering thanks to the policies of the new Labour government and the continued anti-business approach of the SNP.\nTariffs are simply a tax and in Scotland, we've already been paying higher taxes for many years because of the SNP. We've been contributing more than workers in the rest of the UK, but we're not seeing any better services as a result.\nThe new Labour government was supposed to deliver change, that's what was promised in the run up to last year's General Election. But they have sadly broken their promises on an industrial scale.\nDespite saying they wouldn't raise taxes on working people, they have done just that by increasing National Insurance on businesses and introducing more taxes on farmers.\nThe recent spring statement from the Chancellor Rachel Reeves did not make things any better after her disastrous budget last year.\nI have been inundated with messages from small businesses ever since that budget and they all say the same thing. The National Insurance rise means they will have to limit their operations, reduce working hours, scrap plans to hire more people and even, potentially, lay off staff. Tragically, some may even go out of business entirely.\nThe economic damage of that budget will continue for years to come. Labour must now take a different approach, instead of following the SNP way of raising taxes and limiting the potential of our economy.\nIt's basic common sense that, in the face of these new Trump tariffs, both of Scotland's governments must look to support economic growth by bringing bills down for workers and businesses.",
  "https_www_johnlamont_org_/https_www_johnlamont_org_news_ill-keep-championing-borders-railway-extension/content_20.html": "After many months of uncertainty, there has finally been some positive news regarding the Borders Railway extension to Hawick, Newcastleton and onto Carlisle.\nIt was recently confirmed that the UK and Scottish governments will provide matching funds of £5 million each for a feasibility study on the extension.\nI have championed this feasibility study for many years and I had successfully lobbied the Conservative UK government to put forward the funding for it.\nWhen Labour took office, I started to think it may never happen. They put the feasibility study on hold and didn't show much enthusiasm for progressing it.\nHowever, I continued to work hard and campaigned relentlessly to encourage the UK government to go ahead with the plans.\nMost recently, I managed to secure a debate in the UK Parliament on transport links between Scotland and the UK, which I used to urge Labour to agree to progress the Borders Railway extension.\nMy Scottish Conservative colleagues have also applied consistent pressure to both the UK and Scottish governments to encourage progress. Rachael Hamilton MSP and several Scottish Conservative councillors have asked questions, written letters to government ministers, and built momentum for the extension.\nAll of our efforts have paid off now that Labour have stuck with previous Conservative government plans to go ahead with the feasibility study and appoint a project manager to assess the benefits and challenges of extending the line beyond Tweedbank.\nWe're all now delighted to see real progress on this vital project after many years of campaigning to make it happen.\nWe will continue to work constructively with the UK and Scottish governments where possible to deliver for the Borders.\nThe announcement of the feasibility study is wonderful news for local communities, commuters and businesses.\nBut there's a long way to go to make sure this project keeps moving forward, so we'll keep pushing for more progress.\nWe know it would bring more jobs to the local area, help businesses to grow, and give our economy a much-needed boost.\nIt would also help to transform the local rail network and improve the accessibility of public transport routes.\nThose positive developments are worth fighting for and I will continue to do whatever I can to make this extension happen for the benefit of the Borders.",

A further meeting has been scheduled to discuss pricing.\nThe Scottish Borders MP will also write to Scotrail about the ticket machine on the platform which doesn't offer the full range of ticket prices.\nJohn Lamont MP said: “Passengers deserve a better, more reliable service at Reston railway station.\n“It was great to meet with the team from the Rail Action Group again to discuss what needs to be improved.\n“There are a host of problems for passengers that must be addressed. I know that there are concerns that it appears to be more expensive to buy train tickets from Reston compared to the stations at Berwick or Dunbar. This is clearly unfair. Journeys could also be far easier to book and schedule.\n“We look forward to working with TransPenine Express Trains to achieve a better service for local people.”\nTom Thorburn, Honorary President of the Rail Action Group East of Scotland (RAGES), said: “Three of the RAGES Committee met with John Lamont MP and Graham Meiklejohn to discuss the serious concerns centred around the high level of cancellation of TPE’s trains serving Reston, Berwick and Dunbar stations.\n“These cancellations, along with other points raised regarding fares and information, are preventing passengers from having the ability to use this new station at Reston, resulting in the unfortunate passenger having to revert back to a much less environmentally friendly means of transport.\n“This meeting was very thorough, constructive and informative to the issues raised by the RAGES representative committee. Agreement was reached that Mr Meiklejohn would take these concerns to the highest level of TPE management to seek a resolution thereof, and John Lamont MP undertook to discuss matters which lay within his remit.\n“RAGES wish to express their thanks to John and Graham for their time to discuss and hopefully resolve issues at stations in their area served by TPE.”",

It was a fantastic day and weekend of events for people in Jedburgh, the Borders, Scotland and all of our United Kingdom.\nThe Coronation of King Charles marked the beginning of an exciting new era that I hope will be defined by many years of prosperity and progress. It is a time for all of us to come together and celebrate the continuity, stability, and unity that our monarchy represents.\nI respect that everyone holds their own personal views about the monarchy. We do not all agree. But, for me, it is a precious symbol of the shared history and values that we hold dear. It is a vital part of our national identity and what makes us Scottish and British. In my view, the institution, including all those who dedicate their lives to upholding what is stands for, deserves our respect and admiration.\nAlready, King Charles has displayed the same wonderful traits as his mother, the late Queen, by committing his whole life to serving our country. His Majesty has shown impeccable devotion to his duties and an unwavering commitment to championing the values of our nation, for instance in his prescient work to protect our natural environment and the many workers and businesses he gave a helping hand to through the Prince's Trust.\nSo, no matter how you feel about the monarchy, I hope you took the chance to celebrate the Coronation with your friends, family, neighbours or anyone in the local community. That is what the monarchy is all about - bringing people together as one United Kingdom.",

I made that very clear in my submission to the consultation by the energy company Scottish Power Energy Networks (SPEN).\nI stated that I am completely opposed to the mega-pylon project because it would damage local communities and our countryside.\nThere are many potentially negative consequences that could arise if the project goes ahead. The proximity of pylons to homes could impact the quality of life for many local residents. Our countryside could be scarred, which would damage tourism, leave businesses out of pocket, and risk the environment. Agricultural land could suffer, which could affect farms and reduce the amount of produce made here in the Borders. I believe there is another solution - instead of so many overhead wires, underground cabling should be considered.\nI have been speaking regularly with the local campaign organisation, Action Against Pylons, who are an alliance of approximately nine community groups including those in Thornielee & Laidlawstiel, Walkerburn, Clovenfords, Etrrick & Yarrow, Save Scotts Countryside, Lauder & Stow, Hawick & Newcastleton, Upper Liddesdale & Hermitage and Teviot.\nThe groups recently united to form the Action Against Pylons alliance. As a first step, the organisation has invited SPEN and representatives of the Scottish government to walk the proposed route for the pylons so that they can put themselves in the shoes of the people who know and love the Scottish Borders.\nThat seems like a reasonable and sensible request to me. After all, if the people making decisions that will affect the Scottish Borders don't know the land well, then what right do they have to force pylons on those of us who do know and love it?\nThe group has also started a petition which I would encourage you to sign, alongside the campaign on my website, which is available at the following link: https://www.johnlamont.org/campaigns/cross-border-connection. The more people we have registering opposition to these proposals, the more likely it is that the Scottish government and SPEN will be forced to reconsider.\nPlease continue to contact me about these proposals and together, we can protect the Borders from the harm these mega-pylons could do.",
