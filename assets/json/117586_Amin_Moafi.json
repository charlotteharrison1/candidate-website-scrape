However, due to the major parties’ stances on Palestine and Yemen, I stepped down and chose to run as an Independent candidate. Additionally, I was dismayed by the deterioration of our local area, marked by dirtier streets, increased anti-social behavior, and a higher cost of living that plunged people into poverty. I believe that real change cannot be achieved by re-electing the same politicians responsible for these issues. Instead, change requires an Independent candidate who brings fresh perspectives, innovative solutions, and genuine representation, fostering a more responsive government free from party politics.\nMy Policies\nBusiness\n-Create a fund to buy derelict properties on the high street, and re-open them to revitalize the high street.\n-Support Islamic finance product offerings in the UK.\n-Reduce antisocial behavior affecting businesses by collaborating with police.\n-While university loans are available, there is minimal support for those starting businesses. Offer low-interest loans to aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages.\nEducation\n-LGBTQ+ and transgender education classes are not forced, optional upon parents’ consent.\n-In school, commercial skills that are useful in the adult working world are also taught\nForeign policy\n-Invest into building stronger relationships with African nations and return stolen artifacts to all countries upon their request.\n-End military aid to Israel.\n-Establish the State of Palestine.\nHealthcare\n-Free parking for NHS staff.\n-Advocate against NHS privatisation.\nMy qualities\nFrequently Asked Questions\nI have been campaigning in politics for over 7 years, I’ve chosen not to support the major parties this election cycle due to my dissatisfaction with their stance on crucial issues effecting us. Instead, I aim to represent the policies that our area urgently needs but that the parties have failed to deliver on.\nUnlike others, my policies are not generic or unrealistic, they are all completely doable, I do not over promise to win an election, I show honestly what can and will be done by me for you.\nI am independent not held back from party politics or voting rules so I can vote the way my constituencies want without being held back from party leaders so can focus on your needs not party politics.\nIn the UK, the division of powers ensures that MPs do not wield unilateral authority; various departments, such as local councils are responsible for specific matters, like local cleanliness. MP can vote on laws, raise matters in parliament and propose laws, outside of that when addressing problems in different departments their power is through advocacy & influence rater than direct control. This is why on many local matters MPs cannot deliver because they are not the ones responsible or have control over it eg: matters related to local area (the council has most influence). On my policies that I do not have power over I promise advocacy such as working to reduce anti social behaviour and cleanliness in our area. Secondly most politicians are part of a party , I am independent not part of a political party so therefore I can vote independently of political party whip and take action without being held back from party agenda this means I have less factors holding me back from delivering for you.\nAmin is the man with the plan.\nVote Amin 4th July for a better Brent.\nHonest. Reliable. Friendly\n@aminmoafi_\nEmail Address\nLocation\nBrent East"
