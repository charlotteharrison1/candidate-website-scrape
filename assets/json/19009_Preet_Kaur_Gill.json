It’s estimated that the investment in NHS solar panels will save local hospitals across the West Midlands thousands of pounds on their energy bills over their lifetime.\nAs a result of the Conservatives’ failure to secure Britain’s energy independence, schools and hospitals have been hit with sky-high energy bills due to the UK’s dependency on fossil fuel markets. The NHS’ annual energy bill has doubled to £1.4bn a year since 2019.\nIn addition to this new project, the Government has announced that £12m will be put aside for local authorities and community energy groups to build local clean energy projects – including onshore wind turbines, rooftop solar panels and hydropower.\nThe first panels are expected to be delivered by the end of summer 2025.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said:\n“This is a fantastic investment for the West Midlands that will see hospitals and schools saving thousands of pounds on their energy bills.\n“Through Great British Energy, Labour is delivering on its Plan for Change by boosting our energy independence, investing in our public services and delivering lower bills for our communities.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\nA | B | C | D |\nRegion | School sites | NHS sites | Total |\nWest Midlands | 49 | 6 | 55 |\nNorth West | 46 | 52 | 98 |\nNorth East | 44 | 4 | 48 |\nSouth East | 10 | 29 | 39 |\nLondon | 11 | 31 | 42 |\nSouth West | 10 | 34 | 44 |\nEast of England | 10 | 14 | 24 |\nYorkshire and the Humber | 10 | 13 | 23 |\nEast Midlands | 10 | 4 | 14 |",

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_weekly-update-26-august/content_489.html": "Weekly update - 26 August\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Aug 26, 2022\n- 4 min read\nThis week students across the constituency have been receiving their GCSE results. After what has been a difficult and disruptive few years, no matter the outcome, I hope all of our students are proud of what that they have achieved. I’d like to take this opportunity to wish all a massive congratulations!\nThese results come just one week after A-level and BTEC results were shared. These have been more concerning as I know that some students are still waiting on results. This is understandably worrying given how this could have a drastic impact on a student's next steps. I have had a number of worried parents contact me about this and I am happy to support anyone who needs help in contacting schools and exam boards.\nInstead of getting a grip on the situation we’ve also had virtual silence from the Education Secretary. Our zombie government is content to sit by as our kids’ futures are threatened. But this isn’t acceptable. We need to know what ministers are doing to resolve this right now.\nWinter worries as cost-of-living continues to bite\nIt is clear to everyone that the Conservative’s cost of living crisis is unsustainable. As the weather changes and we begin turning on the heating more, people are worried about how they’ll get through this winter. Indeed, many people simply won’t be able to turn on the heating at all.\nMeanwhile, the Conservative Government continues to put the profits of oil and gas giants before the interests of the British people. Giants who tell us they have ‘more cash than we know what to do with’.\nInstead of continuing down this path, we can do something about it. Labour would stop energy prices rising this winter by freezing the price cap, preventing prices rising further and saving households across our constituency the equivalent of £42 million. This plan would be paid for through properly taxing oil and gas producers and closing loopholes waved through by the Tories.\nThat isn’t all. After 12 years of a Tory Government that has failed to secure Britain’s energy security, we need a proper plan for the future. That is why Labour would invest in home grown, clean energy to reduce our reliance on expensive foreign gas and, because our homes are some of the worst insulated in Europe, we’d implement a mass rapid home insulation programme to get bills down long-term.\nI believe Britain deserves better than the path currently etched out by the Tories, and only Labour can give deliver the fresh start our country needs.\nDeeply concerning revelations in Johal’s case\nThis week I was deeply concerned to learn of the revelation that it was information passed by Britain to India that led to Johal’s unlawful arrest, arbitrary detention, and subsequent torture. The Foreign Secretary at that time was Boris Johnson and only he could have signed off the transfer of such information.\nThe revelation has huge implications, showing the UK Government turning against one of its own citizens. My fear is that if it can happen to Johal, it can happen to any Briton travelling overseas.\nLawyers acting for Johal are now taking the UK Government to court over this, with a complaint lodged at the High Court. With Britain bound by international obligations, including the UN Convention Against Torture, the UK Government must act transparently and cooperatively during this case. That must include Boris Johnson coming clean about whether he played a role in the authorisation of sharing intelligence when he was Foreign Secretary.\nDisappointingly, the two candidates to replace Boris Johnson, which includes the current Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, have been silent on Johal’s case. Their silence over a British National arbitrarily detained and tortured abroad cannot wash and I call on them to urgently speak out for his immediate release.\nMy thoughts remain with Johal’s family and friends, whom I wish to reassure that I will continue urging the UK Government to push for Johal’s release.\nCommonwealth Games equipment giveaway\nThe Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games saw incredible sporting action, record ticket sales and viewing figures, and shone a spotlight on our talented region and people.\nNow, the organising committee of the Games, working with Sport England, is looking to give away more than 16,000 sports items used at our Games.\nThe items, which include bikes, martial arts mats, weights, T20 cricket equipment, basketballs, boxing gloves and weights, as well as general equipment, such as cones and bibs, are being made available to local sport and community groups across the West Midlands.\nThe community giveaway will support our shared goal to create a lasting community impact in the West Midlands, by supporting people to be active beyond our Games.\nNot-for-profit community-based organisations, such as local voluntary groups, schools, sports clubs, Community Interest Companies (CICs) and social enterprises that deliver community-based projects, that seek to tackle inactivity and promote the physical and mental benefits of leading an active life, are encouraged to apply.\nA full catalogue of the equipment for the community giveaway will be made available on Sport England website for groups and clubs to look at and apply for.\nIn addition, some of the high-performance equipment from our Games – such as temporary performance sprung flooring that created the netball and 3x3 basketball courts, as well as the boxing ring and high-performance Judo mats - is being distributed amongst national sports bodies.\nThis means that, alongside the separate community giveaway, these sports bodies will be able to repurpose some of their high-performance equipment into communities that can benefit the most from it.\nCommunity groups and schools have until 19 September to get their application in and can apply through the Sport England website.\nLooking for your next role?\nFancy working in Parliament? I’m looking to recruit a Personal Assistant based in London to join my dynamic team. I’m looking for someone who is well-organised, with a strong attention to detail who can support with diary management and assist in the writing of speeches and compilation of briefing packs. If you’re interested, I would strongly encourage applicants of all backgrounds to apply. For more information, please see the full role profile below.

Thank you to everyone that worked over the holidays, especially staff at UHB and the public sector.\nLast year was a historic year for Britain. In July, people voted for change, and since then, this Labour government has been working hard to deliver it.\nNHS\nAfter 14 years of Conservatives, Labour inherited an NHS on its knees. That is why our Government announced £22 billion for the NHS to deliver an extra 40,000 appointments and £3.1 billion for scanners, radiotherapy machines and buildings over the next two years. Read more about our plans to make the NHS fit for the future here.\nIn December, Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirmed that we would bring back the family doctor. The Prime Minister announced an extra £889m on top of the existing budget for GP surgeries to address this. Read more about our plans here.\nI also welcome the news that the Government will be investing an additional £1.6m to support local authority-led stop smoking services in Birmingham. You can find more information about the benefits of quitting smoking in 2025 here.\nThe Health Secretary is seeking your views, experiences and ideas are invaluable to help us shape a new 10 Year Health Plan for England. Share your thoughts by submitting comments to the NHS Change consultation here.\nFunding for Birmingham Hospice\nAfter lobbying the government on my constituents’ behalf about funding for Birmingham Hospice - which had to make a difficult decision to reduce some of its services and make redundancies - I am pleased that the government has agreed to deliver the biggest investment in a generation for hospices, ensuring that hospices can continue to deliver the highest quality end of life care possible for their patients, families, and loved ones.\nThe announcement includes a £100 million boost for adult and children’s hospices to ensure they have the best physical environment for care, and £26 million revenue to support children and young people’s hospices. It will help support hospices and deliver much needed funding for improvements including refurbishments, overhauling IT systems and improving facilities for patients and visitors. You can read more here.\nAdult Social Care\nRaising issues around adult social care in the Chamber\nToday, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting has outlined how our Labour government plans to fix Britain’s social care crisis.\nLouise Casey will chair an independent commission on adult social care, to build a national consensus around a new National Care Service. We will invest an immediate £86 million to the Disabled Facilities Grant, providing about 7,800 extra home adaptations to help disabled people live safely and independently in their own homes.\nWe’re also developing a shared digital platform to make data sharing between the NHS and care staff easier and will be providing better support for care workers to take on further duties meaning people can receive more routine checks and care at home – like blood pressure checks. Read more here.\nCrime\nAt a morning briefing with police\nAfter campaigning for the restoration of neighbourhood policing, I’m thrilled that the Government is investing £48m into West Midlands Police to help fight crime in our communities. You can read more about our plans to take back our streets here.\nPotholes\nSince I was first elected, my inbox has been inundated with constituents who are frustrated about potholes on our roads. Damaged roads can risk lives and cost families hundreds if not thousands of pounds on repairs.\nLabour has announced £1.6 billion to fix potholes and do wider highways maintenance work. It’s a 50% increase on what the Conservative Government spent in 2022 and delivers one of our key manifesto pledges, to get Britain moving again. You can read more about our pledge here.\nChildren\nWith Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government Angela Rayner and school children in the constituency\nAs an ex-children's services manager, I know all too well how our care system has failed vulnerable children in this country. It’s great that our government has introduced a landmark children’s bill to Parliament, which will put in place a package of support to drive high and rising standards throughout our education and care systems so that every child can achieve and thrive.\nThe bill will introduce new registers to identify children who are not in school and pave the way for a unique identifier number for children across services given the shocking cases of children failed by disjointed system. Many of us remember the Arthur Labinjo-Hughes case.\nThousands of pupils will also benefit from a £740 million cash injection to enable more students with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) to achieve and thrive in mainstream schools with more specialist facilities. You can read more about our bill here.\nHousing and Homelessness\nAt foodbanks and baby banks in the constituency\nWe are fuelling growth by reforming planning laws and making the dream of home ownership a reality by building 1.5 million homes. You can read more about our National Planning Policy Framework here.\nI have campaigned on housing and homelessness since I was elected in 2017. Over the years, I have helped hundreds of homeless constituents with their housing situation, as well as supporting local food banks, baby banks, mobile kitchens and food collections to support homeless families and rough sleepers in our constituency.\nThat is why I was thrilled that the Government announced £17.7 million in funding to help tackle homelessness in Birmingham, as part of a government announcement of a record nearly £1 billion for councils to help break the cycle next year. The package includes £5 million for pilots to reduce emergency accommodation in areas with the highest use of B&Bs, including Birmingham. You can read more about our plans here.\nEnvironment\nAt Edgbaston reservoir\nUnder the Conservatives in 2023, raw toxic sewage was being pumped for 360 hours into our waterways in Edgbaston constituency – a 69% increase from 2022. That is a disgrace, and the reason why our Labour government has introduced immediate action to end the shocking behaviour of water companies and their bosses.\nOur Water (Special Measures) Bill will give regulators new powers to take tougher and faster action to crack down on water companies damaging the environment and failing their customers. These new powers given to regulators include banning bonuses and imposing tougher penalties for law-breaking, including imprisonment for water bosses. You can read more about our landmark bill here.\nWe have also set out a clean power plan, which will enable us to deliver an energy system that can bring down bills for households and businesses for good. This will protect households in Birmingham, Edgbaston from the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets and high energy prices. It will also unblock the grid, speed up planning decisions and build more renewables to make Britian energy secure with clean power by 2030. You can read more about our Clean Power 2030 Action plan here.\nBrsk\nSpeaking in a debate I called about broadband poles\nAs your MP, I have been busy in Parliament and the constituency. In Parliament, I called a debate on the rollout of broadband poles in Birmingham, Edgbaston, after my constituents reported to me that unscrupulous providers were needlessly building broadband poles on their roads despite connectivity already being strong and infrastructure already being in place. You can read the full debate here.\n3D Guns\nFrom the C4 documentary I spoke in about 3D guns\nI proposed a new law to clamp down on those possessing, sharing and building 3D-printed guns. I’m delighted to see that thanks to my campaigning, the Home Office will now introduce legislation to close the loophole that has enabled criminals to share and download these blueprints online.\nYou can watch a Channel 4 documentary I featured in on 3D printed guns here.\nExempt\nMy full speech on Exempt Supported Accomodation\nLast year, I held a debate on Exempt Supported Accommodation, where I called for the Government to get on with the job of reforming the exempt sector, so that rogue landlords cannot continue to exploit the current system and provide substandard levels of care for a profit. Watch the full debate by clicking on the above video.\nTen Minute Rule Bill\nMy full speech outlining my Ten Minute Rule Bill\nI put forward a Private Members Bill to address the injustice facing Sikh and Jewish people. The Bill would ensure public bodies must include Sikhs and Jews as specific ethnic categories for delivering services. If we consider our legal status as ethnic groups, we should be included. If we consider discrimination we face, we should be included. You can read more about my Bill here.\nLibraries\nMy first letter to the Council fighting for our libraries to be saved\nIn the constituency, I have been holding the council to account over the future of our libraries and exploring alternative ways in which we can maintain these services. This includes working with constituents to set up community-led Friends of the Library groups for Harborne and Bartley Green, which would mean residents would be directly involved in running or supporting their library service.\nHarborne Day Centre\nPosing questions about Harborne Day Centre to the commissioner\nI have been working with the council and the commissioners to look for alternative ways to maintain Harborne Day Centre, which is a vital resource for carers as well as the people who use it, many of whom have complex needs. I have been holding the Lead Commissioner to account on his decision to suppress a “call in” request from councillors over the decision, which is blocking democratic scrutiny. I am glad to hear that, after my lobbying, the council is now looking at ways to save the centre.\nCasework\nThis year, I have been busy helping thousands of constituents with diverse problems and concerns. I closed nearly 10,000 cases with constituents covering a variety of issues, including housing, crime and policy queries.\nPlease do get in touch if there is anything you would like me to help you with, by emailing preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk or calling 0121 392 8426.\nLocal News\nOn Friday 17th January, the MHWC will be visiting Ferncliffe Road in Harborne, B17 0QG. The centre will be open between 7:30am and 1pm, so please do come along if you have any bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

We will double the number of medical school places, create 10,000 more nursing and midwifery clinical placements each year, double the number of district nurses qualifying each year and train 5,000 more health visitors, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status. We will also recruit 8,500 more mental health staff paid for by closing tax loopholes exploited by private equity.\nUnder Labour, the NHS will be there when people need it; with fewer lives lost to the biggest killers; in a fairer Britain, where everyone lives well for longer!\nPolitics Live\nThis week, I joined the BBC’s Jo Coburn and others for Politics Live.\nWe discussed, among other talking points, the chaos and confusion of the government’s immigration policy, the weakness of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and the never-ending Conservative circus of crisis after crisis.\nOn immigration, Labour is clear: our points-based immigration system will work for Britain, our businesses, our public services, and our communities. Labour will ensure our immigration system is fair. And, if this government doesn’t have the ideas and it feels it’s very difficult then it needs to step aside.\nMeanwhile, the country is sick and tired of the never-ending crises that have engulfed successive Conservative governments. When Rishi Sunak became the fifth Conservative Prime Minister in seven years, he promised integrity and professionalism. What we’ve actually seen is weakness and more of the same. The Prime Minister does not look in control of his own Ministers and is constantly trying to appease his backbenchers.\nLabour will clean up politics, work in the interests of the whole country, and create a genuinely independent Integrity and Ethics Commission to restore standards in public life.\nFind a clip of my contribution to Politics Live below.\nCalling time on poorly regulated parking firms\nConstituents regularly write to me about unfair Penalty Charge Notices and the poorly regulated private parking sector. Last year, a new Private Parking Code of Practice was introduced but then swiftly withdrawn pending a ‘temporary review’.\nHowever, the Code remains withdrawn almost a year later and the government are yet to set out when the Code will be reissued.\nAll the while, constituents continue to raise cases with me. Examples of cases I have dealt with involve misleading signage, opaque appeals systems, aggressive debt collection and exorbitant fines.\nTherefore, this week, I have written to the Transport Secretary to ask that they outline a clear timescale for the review and when constituents can expect the Code to be reissued. Find my letter below.\nRead my letter in full below.\nLocal News\nThis week, Edgbaston Cricket Ground hosted 1,500 pupils from schools across Birmingham and Warwickshire as an early half-term treat and to see some of the country’s best women cricketers in action. This is part of Edgbaston’s drive to further raise the profile of women’s cricket, inspire future generations of crickets, and to promote physical and mental health through sport. I wish to thank all those involved in making this day a great success!\nIf you live in Harborne, you may be aware that a Birmingham City Council are consulting on a planning application (2023/02215/PA) submitted to them for the erection of single storey portable buildings to provide car wash and valeting facilities. This is located at the Car Park Adjacent to No. 1 St Johns Road, Harborne, Birmingham, B17 9LD. Comments can be returned to the Council online here by 29 May.\nThe Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Ferncliffe Road (B17 0GQ) on Monday 5 June between 07:00 and 12:45. If you are in the area and have bulky household waste to dispose of then please come along.\nAnd finally, I hope you all have a fabulous bank holiday this weekend!\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-26-january/content_240.html": "My Weekly Update - 26 January\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Jan 26, 2024\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Jan 30, 2024\nThis week, Keir Starmer unveiled Labour’s agenda to tackle knife crime and protect young people.\nThe increase in knife crime under the Tories is deeply disturbing. Knife crime is now 77 per cent higher than in 2015, and serious violence is rising. In Birmingham, ten people are victims of knife crime every week. The testaments of bereaved families are heartbreaking.\nSix Tory Home Secretaries have promised to create a law to ban zombie-style knives and machetes, but they don’t go anywhere near far enough. With Labour, there will be no more loopholes, no more caveats, and no more false promises. Labour will restore the rule of law on Britain’s streets and in our town centres, and take urgent action to keep our young people safe from knife crime. We will:\nUrgently legislate to ban zombie-style knives and toughen up the government’s promised ban to include a wider range of weapons, and toughen existing rules on serration and centimetre length.\nIntroduce tough criminal sanctions on tech executives who allow knife sales on their online marketplaces, such as Amazon Marketplace, eBay and Instagram.\nConduct a rapid review of online knife sales from the point of purchase through to delivery, in particular to strengthen ID checks, and checks conducted by Royal Mail and Border Force for UK-bound parcels.\nA Labour government will also end the empty warnings and apology letters for knife possession, guaranteeing sanctions and serious interventions for young people carrying knives. With Labour:\nEvery offender must be referred to a Youth Offending Team and have a mandatory, bespoke action plan to prevent reoffending.\nTough new guidance so that serious penalties are always considered where appropriate, such as curfews, tagging, or behavioural contracts.\nThis week, I wrote a piece for Politics.co.uk about the dire state of NHS dentistry under the Tories, and Labour’s plan to rescue it.\nLabour analysis shows that 8/10 dentists aren’t accepting new adult patients, and 7/10 are shutting their doors to new child patients. In some areas, 99% of practices are taking on no new NHS patients.\nAt the same time, the UK has some of the worst child health outcomes in Europe. Rotting teeth is the number one reason children aged 6 to 10 are admitted to hospital, with on average 169 children undergoing extractions every single day.\nLabour will rescue NHS dentistry, because children should be chasing their dreams, not a dentist's appointment. Labour will provide 700,000 more urgent appointments each year and incentives for new NHS dentists to work in areas with the greatest need, and introduce supervised toothbrushing in schools for 3–5-year-olds, targeted at the areas with highest childhood tooth decay. This will all be paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status, because our constituents need dentist’s appointments more than the wealthy need tax breaks.\nRead my article:\nChildren Missing Education\nRecently, I’ve been raising concerns over the high number of children missing education in Birmingham. It’s shocking that 1 in 4 children in the city missed out of 10% or more of their schooling in 2021/2. Of course, many students miss out on much more than 10% and disappear altogether from the system.\nI have written to the Council asking for more detail of their plan to tackle this issue.\nLabour is ambitious for all our children. In government, we will legislate for a new Register of Pupils to get a grip with persistent non-attendance.\nMore in the Birmingham Mail:\nMeasles\nMany families in Birmingham, like mine, will be concerned by the rapid spread of measles in the city. In Parliament, I put an urgent question to the Government, asking what steps it is taking to grip this crisis before it becomes a national outbreak.\n5 years ago, the UK was declared measles-free. It's a badge of shame for this Government that the UK has lost this status on its watch. I also spoke to Newscast about the outbreak in Birmingham, and my concerns with the Government's lack of action to contain this outbreak.\nMy appearance on Newscast:\nDHSC Orals\nThis week in Parliament, I raised the case of Emma, from Grimsby, who had her NHS dentist close in 2020 and hasn't been able to register with one since. After an emergency appointment in Scunthorpe, she's been referred to hospital to have three teeth removed.\nI asked the Minister what she has to say to Emma, and the millions like her, who are unable to get a dentist's appointment?\nRoundtable, Future of Primary Care\nIt was great to host a roundtable to discuss the future of General Practice and primary care under a Labour Government.\nCreating a Neighbourhood Health Service is central to Labour's mission to make the NHS fit for the future.\nHidden Heroes\nThis week, it was lovely to attend the Hidden Heroes event. It was an honour to work with such brilliant people on the work of Coventry UNESCO Associated Schools Network and the #HiddenHeroes project, with 1,500 students having taken part so far.\nSpecial thanks to Sienna, Anya and Layla for the lovely portraits.\nLocal News\nMeasles\nWith measles cases on the rise, it’s really important to get vaccinated and contain the spread. The disease transmits very easily and can lead to serious problems for some.\nThe best way to prevent measles is to have the MMR vaccine. This vaccine is available at every GP practice, and it is free.\nThe MMR vaccine is safe for every faith. There is a type of MMR vaccine that does not contain pork gelatine, so it can be used for people who do not touch any pork products.\nMore information on the NHS website here:\nFour Dwellings\nI’m really proud to see Four Dwellings school awarded a ‘Good' rating by Ofsted. Well done to the amazing teachers for their hard work, and to the brilliant students. Well deserved!\nMHRC\nOn Tuesday 30th January, the MHRC will be visiting Clapgate Lane shopping centre, B32 3DH, in Bartley Green, and Meadow Road, B17 8BU, in Harborne. The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so please do come along if you’re local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nCampaigning\nIt was great to join Labour members campaigning in the constituency and West Bromwich last week. If you would like to support me campaigning and join me doorknocking, please contact: officeofpreetgill@gmail.com.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

However, this deal needed to go much further in its ambition to truly level up our region.\n“This deal has not resolved any of the long-term funding issues for local authorities that can truly unlock the potential of cities such as Birmingham. Local councils rely on the funding from Government. This deal does not undo the £800 million that has been taken out of Birmingham which has done irreparable harm to our city over the last 13 years by this Conservative Government.\n“Birmingham’s Labour council has the bold vision to make this a golden decade of opportunity. It is disappointing that this Conservative Government and this Conservative Mayor do not have the desire to meet this ambition. This is simply a continuation of the begging bowl politics we have come to expect from this Government and yet more sticking plaster politics.\n“Only with Labour in power will we see the English towns and cities truly take back control from Westminster. We will build a fairer, greener, more dynamic country where working people succeed, aspiration is rewarded, and where together, we unlock the pride and purpose in every community.”",

This is the outcome of a decades-long journey in our city.\nHistorically, the service was rated ‘Inadequate’ but has been improving in recent years. This week, Ofsted recognised the continued political drive for improvement, which has been sustained through the pandemic, rating Birmingham City Council and the Children’s Trust as ‘Good’.\nIn their report, Ofsted noted how “political leaders give great priority to children in Birmingham. Despite the financial pressures the council faces, investment in strengthening services in response to increased demand is a continuing commitment.”\nThe achievement of 'Good' from Ofsted is the outcome of the continued political drive of both Birmingham City Council and Birmingham Children's Trust. It's an achievement that shows how children are at the heart of everything the city council and leadership are doing.\nAs a former Children's Services Manager in Birmingham, I'm proud of the dedication of our social workers who continue to work hard to safeguard our children despite the cuts and austerity brought to key services by this Conservative Government.\nAmbulance waiting times soar to the longest on record\nNew figures emerged this week detailing how ambulance response times hit record highs this winter, with patients with conditions like strokes and heart attacks waiting an hour and a half on average in December.\nMore than 48,000 people across the West Midlands region waited more than two hours. On the long list of 999 calls were thousands of people suffering strokes, chest pains, 'trauma' injuries and breathing problems as well as people who were unconscious. The picture across the UK is even bleaker with one patient left waiting two and a half days for an ambulance.\nPatients are also facing record long waits outside hospitals once ambulances arrive, due to staff and bed shortages. One patient in our region waited 32 hours outside a hospital in the back of an ambulance. This simply isn’t acceptable. That’s why last April I wrote to the then Health Minister Savid Javid regarding dire warning being issued by West Midlands Ambulance Service. His response arrived more than two months later but failed to address how the Government will tackle the root causes of the issues within the ambulance service.\nI was appalled that Greg Hands, the Conservative Chairman, described Britain’s public services as being in ‘good shape’. Regardless of party politics, I simply don’t understand how anyone can come to that conclusion when 7 million patients are on NHS waiting lists, 98% of rapes are going uncharged and 1.2 million households are caught up in the housing crisis and are stuck on waiting lists for a suitable property.\nIt’s distressing that patients can no longer trust that an ambulance will reach them in an emergency. Stroke and heart attack victims are left waiting for hours, when every second counts. This is the terrifying reality after 13 years of Conservative understaffing of our NHS and is why, earlier this year, I also backed Birmingham Live’s campaign pressing for urgent action to drastically improve ambulance response times.\nPatients should be able to phone 999, safe in the knowledge that they will get an answer and an ambulance when they need it. The longer we give the Conservatives in office, the longer patients will wait.\nLabour will launch the biggest expansion of the NHS workforce in history, training the staff needed to reach patients on time, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status. We will ensure the NHS is there for us when we need it once again.\nRaising my concerns on future pandemic preparedness\nThis week I spoke in Westminster Hall on the UK’s pandemic preparedness.\nThe Covid pandemic has been one of the most surreal and seismic global events of our lifetimes. 212,000 people have died as a result in the UK, our economy has been directly hit to the tune of £250 billion of lost GVA and the social impacts on everything from our children’s lost learning to NHS waiting lists will be felt for years to come.\nIt would be easy to write off the pandemic as an act of God, but that would also be irresponsible. The extent of the damage the pandemic caused was not inevitable. The UK was badly underprepared. NHS waiting lists were at record levels even before the pandemic hit. We had 100,000 staff shortages in our health service. 112,000 vacancies in social care.\nPandemic preparedness must therefore be taken seriously as a matter of national security. Future threats could be far deadlier than Covid-19. It is why the Labour Party supports the principle of a legally binding World Health Organisation treaty, which sets the standard for all countries to contribute to global health security. Our country was set back not just once, but three times by new dangerous Covid variants which had originated overseas. We are stronger together that trying to firefight these crises alone.\nThe World Health Organisation is the primary UN agency for international public health. In its history of over 70 years, it has contributed to the eradication of smallpox and has helped immunise millions of children against preventable diseases such as tuberculosis and measles. If we can use the World Health Organisation to support basic universal healthcare around the world, then infectious diseases are less likely to spread and fuel global pandemics. That is in our interests.\nLabour has a comprehensive plan to strengthen Britain’s health security. To end the 13 years of sticking plaster politics under this Government and return Britain to the international stage as a trusted partner.\nWhat’s happening around the constituency?\nThis week I had the honour of cutting the ribbon to mark the opening of the Bartley Green Community Fridge. The first community fridge in Birmingham, will help address food insecurity, getting free food to families and reducing food waste. The Community Fridge is open every Tuesday and Thursday from 11am to 5pm on a first come first served basis at 26-30 Hillwood Road.\nAs well as being part of the council’s Warm Spaces programme, St Germain’s Church on City Road has just launched a raft of fabulous community programmes. They include a new exercise class called ‘Move It or Lose It’ which runs on Thursdays between 12.45-1.30pm and a free ‘Music for All’ class involving drums, singing and collaboration which runs every Friday 2-4pm.\nThis Saturday, FoodCycle will be coming to St Boniface Church on Quinton Road West. The project welcomes everyone to come and enjoy good company and conversation with others from your local area over a delicious meal, prepared with care by FoodCycle volunteers. No need to book, just turn up at 12pm.\nAnd finally, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be returning to the constituency on the following dates and locations between 7am – 12pm.\nEdgbaston – Ampton Road, B15 2UP – 27th April\nHarborne – Vicarage Road, B17 0SN – 2nd May\nNorth Edgbaston – Glencoe Road, B16 0PB – 5th May\nBartley Green – Monmouth Road, B32 3NP – 10th May\nQuinton – Simmons Drive, B32 1ST – 31st May\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Growth is forecast to accelerate to 1.9% in 2026, and the OBR has increased the growth forecast every year thereafter.\nKickstarting economic growth is the number one mission of this government, putting more money in people’s pockets. We are not satisfied with the short-term growth figures, so the Government has announced we are going further and faster to improve this. We have announced a further £13 billion of capital investment over the Parliament to go further on growth. This will deliver the projects needed to catalyse private investment, boost growth and drive forward the UK’s modern industrial strategy. You can read more here.\nIn the Spring Statement, I asked the Chancellor if she agreed with me that the Conservatives clearly don’t understand the link between their failure to build houses and infrastructure and the economic constraints we face today. You can watch my intervention below.\nConstruction\nWith Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Birmingham Alexandra Stadium\nWe have announced that we are investing £600 million to get young people into the construction industry, allowing experienced workers to pass on their skills and support employers to offer industry placements.\nThe West Midlands already has a proud record of construction jobs, with 173,292 working in the sector – around 5.7% of the total regional workforce. Our investment will get Britain building, training a further 60,000 more construction workers and breaking down the barriers to opportunity for thousands of young people. You can read more here.\nHousing\nOn Tuesday, the Government announced a new investment of £2 billion to support the biggest boost in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation.\nThis investment will support the construction of up to 18,000 new social and affordable homes, helping hard working families to get safe and secure homes and kickstarting economic growth.\nThis investment comes as a down payment from the Treasury ahead of more long-term investment in social and affordable housing planned later this year, as part of our plan to build 1.5 million homes and tackle the housing crisis. Read more here.\nCommunity-led Housing\nThe Government is investing to accelerate the delivery of community-led housing.\nA £20 million package for community groups, such as community land trusts and housing co-operatives, has been confirmed by the Housing Minister that will directly support the construction of more than 2,500 new homes over the next decade. These housebuilding projects will be led by communities to specifically address local needs in their area. You can read more here.\nPlanning and Infrastructure Bill\nAt Curzon Street Station\nThis week, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill had its Second Reading in Parliament. Making this Bill law will be key to get Britain building and drive economic growth.\nSignificant reforms will be introduced through the Bill to speed up planning decisions, remove unnecessary blockers and challenges to housing development and major infrastructure projects like windfarms, while at the same time delivering for the environment through the new Nature Restoration Fund. You can read more about our Bill here.\nThis week, the OBR has also concluded that our planning reforms will bring housebuilding to its highest level in 40 years by the end of the Parliament. Read more here.\nTobacco and Vapes Bill\nMy speech in the Tobacco and Vapes Bill\nThe Tobacco and Vapes Bill is a landmark piece of legislation that will deliver a world-leading smoking ban to stop the cycle of addiction and protect children.\nIt will also stop vapes and other consumer nicotine products from being deliberately branded and advertised to appeal to children and ban the sale of vapes in vending machines. These measures will help to stop the next generation from becoming hooked on nicotine.\nThe promulgation of dangerous illicit vapes in shops, schools and on our streets is also a real concern. In Birmingham, trading standards and the police led raids on retailers under Operation Cloud, where they seized nearly £6 million pounds worth of illicit vapes, tobacco and drugs.\nOn the Conservatives’ watch, children were being sold vapes marketed as 0% nicotine, which were found to actually contain nicotine, and vapes that contained dangerous chemicals like anti-freeze and lead. I welcome the Government introducing a testing regime and a licensing regime for vapes, to protect our children and keep consumers safe. The government is also introducing £200 on the spot fines for retailers selling products to people under-age, a policy I suggested during the last Parliament.\nRead more here.\nDefence\nOur world is changing, and Britain must be ready. Europe is facing a once-in-a-generation moment for its collective security, with conflicts overseas undermining security and prosperity at home.\nThat’s why we are bringing in a new era of security and renewal, with a further £2.2 billion in defence spending committed for 2025/6. This raises spending on defence to 2.36% next year and will be invested in fitting Royal Navy ships with Directed Energy Weapons five years earlier than planned, providing better homes for military families and modernising His Majesty’s Naval Base Portsmouth.\nYou can read more here.\nProcurement\nThis week, a major £1.6 billion equipment contract was agreed with British defence firm Babcock to support British defence jobs.\nBritish Army equipment, including tanks and armoured vehicles, will receive world-class maintenance and spare parts. This contract will also sustain 1,600 UK skilled jobs, including over 400 in Telford and over 250 in Dorset. Read more here.\nAccess to Arts and Culture\nThe Government has announced that museums and libraries are set to receive a share of over £30 million of funding to improve access to arts and culture. This money will be dedicated towards maintenance repairs and upgrades to their buildings, ensuring they can continue to tell the story of our nation’s rich history and providing spaces for people from all walks of life to access books, work and learn. You can read more here.\nGrassroots Sports Clubs\nGrassroots sports clubs are at the heart of communities across the country. We are investing £100 million into grassroots sports clubs across the UK to deliver funding for pitches and related facilities.\nLabour will remove barriers to an active lifestyle and increase opportunity for all, so that wherever people live, they can access high-quality sports facilities and experience the joy that sport brings. Read more here.\nNatWest Event\nIt was brilliant to join businesses last night at the NatWest Accelerator Hub in Birmingham.\nIt was inspiring to see entrepreneurs based in the West Midlands pitching their innovative business ideas. Small and medium sized businesses are the driving force of our economy, both at a local and national level. Our Labour government will support businesses to kickstart growth in every region across the country.\nLocal News\nRestore the Music School Visit\nWith young musicians at Lordswood Boys school\nIt was really great to see how Restore the Music, who provide schools with funding to help them buy diverse and relevant musical instruments, can support students across the UK to explore their interest in music.\nI visited students at Lordswood Boys School in my constituency who have benefited massively from investment in their music department.\nNHS Consultation\nWith Health Secretary Wes Streeting at West Midlands Regional Conference\nWe are currently designing our 10 Year Health plan to make our NHS fit for the future.\nWe are proposing three shifts – hospital to community, analogue to digital and sickness to prevention – to create a health service that delivers for you.\nHelp us make this a reality by telling us what you think about some of the emerging ideas for change. There are five sections, each with a video introducing the ideas, and some questions for you to answer. Please complete the survey, here, before 14th April.\nBuses Consultation\nPeople in the West Midlands deserve a bus service that is safe, efficient and reliable. Transport for West Midlands are running a consultation on the future of our bus service and its plans to bring the service into public control. Have your say before 30th March, here.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

We stepped in after British Steel's owners threatened to close down their site in Scunthorpe, risking thousands of jobs and the future of our national steel industry.\nAll options are on the table to secure the future of the industry. Since taking office this government has been negotiating in good faith with British Steel’s owners, Jingye. However, despite our offer to Jingye being substantial, they wanted much more – an excessive amount.\nOver the last week, it became clear that their intention was to close down primary steel making at British Steel. That is why we stepped in to save British Steel, so we can continue to build the homes, railways, schools and hospitals we need to usher in a decade of national renewal.\nLegislation we passed allows us to take control of British Steel’s blast furnaces, maintaining steel production and, by extension, protecting the company’s 3,500-strong workforce. We have also ensured the supply of raw materials to the site.\nYou can read the Prime Ministers’ statement, here, and the Business Secretary’s statement, here. You can watch the Business Secretary speaking in the Commons about British Steel, here.\nPolitics Midlands\nSpeaking to Politics Midlands about Labour's plan for fixing our roads\nOn Sunday, I appeared on Politics Midlands, where I spoke about the Birmingham bin strike, local elections and potholes. You can watch the full episode here.\nBin Strike\nSpeaking to Sky News about the bin strike\nIt’s incredibly disappointing that Unite rejected an improved offer from the Council on Monday, which could have brought an end to these strikes. Unite’s proposals focus solely on retaining a role that does not exist in other councils and represents an equal pay risk for Birmingham.\nFor far too long, our waste service hasn’t been fit for purpose – way before the strikes, my constituents were writing to me about missed bin collections. Public services must deliver for the taxpayer.\nMy constituents deserve better, I have been urging Unite to reconsider and accept the fair and reasonable offer on the table.\nRead more in The Metro, here. Listen to my interview with BBC Radio WM below.\nHillsborough Disaster 1989\nWednesday marked thirty-six years since one of the greatest disasters in our history – the Hillsborough Disaster. That day, 97 innocent people tragically lost their lives.\nIn the years since, their families and loved ones have campaigned tirelessly to get justice. Our Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, promised to bring a Hillsborough Law before Parliament, with a legal duty of candour for public authorities and public servants, and criminal sanctions for anyone who fails to comply. He has committed to delivering on that promise.

Some of the companies set to benefit are Barclays Bank, Revolut and HSCB Bank, who will now be expanding their operations in India.\nIn a changing world, it is imperative we go further and faster to kickstart economic growth.

For that reason I find it baffling that The Property Institute has quietly reinstated FirstPort’s membership last month.\nMany managing agents do a good job and will be crucial in the transition to commonhold, but too often leaseholders are being let down. More needs to be done to protect leaseholders from abuse and poor service at the hands of unscrupulous agents.\nThe sector must get its own house in order, or the new government will regulate it, where the last failed to for too long.

This would impact my constituents and local businesses – it would mean that Edgbaston and North Edgbaston residents and businesses would potentially have to travel to Aston for their mail, an hour’s walk or two bus journeys away. As more than 40% of households in North Edgbaston don’t have access to a van or car – double the national rate – this could seriously inconvenience thousands of people.\nNeither residents nor I were consulted over this decision. I wrote to Royal Mail, asking them to postpone any decision until a consultation with residents is carried out.\nNorth Summerfield Residents’ Association\nThe North Summerfield Residents’ Association has circulated their April 2025 Newsletter (read below).

Many people will be making the difficult choice between heating and eating.\nRight now, so many people – including young families and pensioners - won't be able to afford to turn the heating on at all.\nI’ll never forget one of the constituents I spoke to earlier this year, who told me how worried they were about managing their bills. They told me how they have just £334 per month to survive on. That is meant to cover payments for gas, electric, TV licence, food, phone, internet, council tax and water bills. My constituent has struggled to find employment and knows people can’t survive on such low benefits for a prolonged period. This has had a significant impact on his mental health and that was before prices go up.\nPeople across Birmingham are worried about how they will make ends meet through this winter with record numbers plunged into fuel poverty. In my constituency of Edgbaston, 37.4% of households are fuel poor. This is compared to 18.8% just three years ago. In fact, our region of the West Midlands is the worst affected in the UK with almost one in four families impacted by fuel poverty.\nWe are in the midst of a national economic emergency. Labour’s message is clear, enough is enough.\nWe have a choice. This Tory government can carry on letting giant oil and gas producers make huge profits whilst working people and pensioners suffer.\nOr we can do something about it. Labour would stop energy prices rising this winter by freezing the price cap, preventing prices rising further and saving the average household around £1,000.\nWe would pay for this by taxing oil and gas producers properly, getting rid of the loopholes the Tories were happy to wave through.\nIt means that households across my constituency of Edgbaston would save the equivalent of £42 million on Labour’s fully costed plan. Across Birmingham, that would extrapolate to over £430 million.\nThis £29bn plan will also bring inflation down, making future interest rate hikes less likely and ease the burden on households and businesses.\nBut we need to solve the energy crisis for good. We’d insulate every home that needs it to get bills down with our Warm Homes Plan.\nAnd we’d get Britain off expensive foreign gas - by investing much, much more in home grown, cleaner energy such as solar, wind, hydrogen and nuclear power.\nThat is the only way to make sure people in my constituency of Edgbaston and across Birmingham never again face an energy price crisis like this.\nWe’ve had 12 years of a Tory Government that has failed to secure Britain's energy supplies, leaving bills higher and our country less secure.\nLabour’s plan would end the price hikes now, reduce inflation and create cheaper, cleaner energy for the future – helping people get through the winter and providing the foundations for a stronger, more secure economy.\nOnly Labour can give Britain the fresh start it needs.",

It is now live at major stations through digital screens, where possible, and at other stations, passengers will be able to scan a QR code to see the data online.\nThis fulfils a commitment made by this Labour government to be fully transparent with passengers, demonstrating how the railways are working and allowing the public to hold train operators to account as we bring services into public ownership.\nAs well as delivering more reliable, better-quality services, these reforms will catalyse economic growth through improved connectivity, delivering on the government’s Plan for Change. By holding operators to account, they will be encouraged to drive up efficiency and productivity - providing better value for money for passengers and driving forward the government’s growth mission by delivering better connectivity.\nThe government is determined to drive up performance, and the Rail Minister is meeting with all train operators to address concerns and demand immediate action. In response, the industry has set out a framework with clear areas of focus, including timetable resilience and staffing, to recover performance to acceptable levels.\nPreet Kaur Gill, Labour Member of Parliament for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“Easy access to punctuality and cancellation data is a very welcome development. Railway passengers in my constituency deserve to know what is happening on their journeys and forcing operators to make information public will mean they can’t hide any more.\n“We’ve had decades of poor service on our railways but bit by bit Labour is turning things around and I will continue to work hard to boost our local economy, connect families and ensure better value for money for all passengers.”\nTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander said:\n“Today marks the beginning of a new era of rail accountability.\n“These displays are a step towards rebuilding trust with passengers using our railways, as we continue to tackle the root causes of frustrating delays and cancellations.\n“Through fundamental rail reform, we’re sweeping away decades of dysfunctionality – putting passengers first, driving growth through connectivity as part of this government’s Plan for Change.”\nEach station’s data can also be found on the ORR’s new data portal, which contains punctuality and reliability information for all stations in Great Britain. The online data is also screen reader compatible, for those with accessibility needs.\nThe screens also display a short commentary on work underway by the operators and Network Rail to improve performance, informing and assuring passengers of the ongoing work across their area to improve the reliability and efficiency of services.\nThis forms part of a wider overhaul of the railways, which will establish Great British Railways (GBR) as a new body to bring track and train together, to end years of fragmentation and waste. GBR will relentlessly focus on driving up standards for passengers, and proposals for how it will run, including plans for a powerful new passenger standards watchdog, are currently under consultation.\nSeparately, the landmark Public Ownership Act will improve services and save taxpayers up to £150m a year that was previously given to private shareholders, with the first services being brought in as soon as May 2025.\nThis Labour government will deliver change that can be felt, driving growth across the country by ensuring passengers can use the railways to get to work, school, appointments and see friends and family with ease.\nNotes to editors\n• ‘Punctuality’ on the performance displays is defined as the percentage of trains arriving within three minutes of their scheduled time.\n• The information displayed on the screens will cover the 14 DfT funded operators, except where other operators have agreed that information on their services can be displayed",

After the police released photos of the murder weapon, experts identified the handgun as a particular model of “ghost gun”—a homemade weapon with no serial number, created by assembling a mix of commercial and DIY parts. The gun appears to have been part 3D-printed – although ballistics experts need to test it to confirm.\nThe rise of 3D-printed firearms on our streets is a serious threat. In 2022, UK authorities seized 17 3D-printed firearms, a significant increase from just three the year before. Last year in Birmingham, a local man was convicted of possession of a range of home-made assault rifles manufactured with a 3D printer in his home.\nBlueprints to make untraceable lethal weapons can now be shared and downloaded easily via social media and the web, presenting a real challenge to law enforcement agencies trying to stop the circulation of firearms on Britain’s streets.\nAs organised crime changes, legislation must keep up. Earlier this year, I presented the Firearms (3D Printing) Bill to Parliament, to shut down a loophole that means it is legal to possess or share a blueprint to make 3D-printed guns, or part-make a 3D-printed gun.\nI am delighted that today the Government has announced that it will take forward my Bill and change the law to clamp down on these dangerous untraceable weapons. I look forward to working with the Government to get this legislation right, so we can crack down on these lethal blueprints and give law enforcement the powers they need.\nLabour Friends of the Commonwealth\nOn Tuesday evening, I was honoured to welcome the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Dominica, Dr Roosevelt Skerritt, for the launch of a new group I will chair, Labour Friends of the Commonwealth (LFC).\nThe well-attended event, held in Parliament, focused on the ‘Future of Democracies across the Commonwealth’. Prime Minister Skerrit, who leads the Dominica Labour Party and is the first patron of the group, spoke of the longstanding historic ties between our parties, and the role the UK has played on the world stage under Labour governments of the past.\nIn launching this group, our ambition is simple but bold: to build closer ties with Labour Parties and progressives across the Commonwealth. We believe that by working together, we can address the defining challenges of our time—climate change, inequality, and democratic renewal—more effectively than any one country can alone.\nFor me, this is personal. Birmingham, our home, is a Commonwealth city, and the diverse heritage of people here span from the Carribbean to Africa, from Malta to India, from where my own family came. Whether or not we have direct ties, all MPs represent constituents with a deep connection to this global family.\nToday, the Commonwealth represents more than 2.5 billion people. As the UK seeks to reconnect with other allies on the international stage following years of chaos and division, I want to use this group to build closer links with our allies and forge a progressive alliance on the great global challenges and opportunities we share.\nWe are stronger together.\n£740 million for SEND\nLast month the National Audit Office highlighted the crisis in the SEND system, with very limited progress having been made in making mainstream schools more inclusive in recent years, harming children’s life chances. I know this only too well from the conversations I have had with constituents. Earlier this year I met with teachers at Woodgate Primary School who highlighted the challenges the system is placing on families and schools.\nSince leaving government, Conservative Shadow Ministers reflected on the SEND system they left behind with one remarking at Conservative Party Conference that his government ‘did not do enough’ on SEND and they should ‘hang [their] heads in shame’. The previous Conservative Education Secretary has labelled the system ‘lose, lose, lose.’\nThat is why I am delighted to support plans from the new government to fix the Tories’ “lose, lose, lose” SEND system. Thousands of pupils in Birmingham will benefit from a £740 million cash injection to pave the way for more pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) to achieve and thrive in mainstream schools.\nThis new funding can be used to adapt classrooms to be more accessible for children with SEND, and to create specialist facilities within mainstream schools that can deliver more intensive support adapted to suit the pupils’ needs.\nIt will start to pave the way for Labour’s wide-ranging, long term plans for reform to help more pupils with SEND to have their needs met in mainstream schools.\nBroadband Poles in Birmingham\nThis week I called a debate on the rollout of broadband poles in Birmingham, where I shared residents’ concerns with the minister about the activities of Brsk.\nLast year, we managed to convince Brsk to move a pole in front of Perrott’s Folly and the Waterworks tower. This has a huge significance to our heritage, as the towers inspired JRR Tolkien in “The Lord of the Rings”.\nWe continue to be frustrated by the failure of companies like Brsk to provide adequate opportunity for consultation, to respond to feedback from residents, and most of all, to share existing infrastructure, such as underground ducts which mean more poles don’t need to go up. The company is currently being investigated by Ofcom.\nI and the vast majority of my constituents support the roll-out of new broadband infrastructure, which will be crucial for the future of our economy. But as I said to the Minister, it should not take a well-organised community campaign and an active MP to get an operator to meet its statutory duties as it rolls this infrastructure out.\nI’m pleased the Minister shares many of my concerns and has promised to hold Brsk’s feet to the fire. In particular, I’ve been encouraged that it was revealed Brsk now has guaranteed access to BT Openreach infrastructure to install broadband lines underground, following a meeting with the Minister.\nFundamentally, my constituents are asking for respect: respect to influence decisions, and to ensure that broadband infrastructure is implemented in a way that respects their local environment, heritage and public interest.\nI was grateful for the opportunity to send a message to the cowboy operators in Birmingham.\nAlzheimer's Research\nIt was a great pleasure this week to meet Scott Mitchell, the husband of the late and great Dame Barbara Windsor.\nBarbara Windsor was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2014, and she and Scott have been incredible campaigners for more support and research into this awful condition.\nI know that many constituents have personal experiences with Alzheimer’s, and will relate to Scott’s experience. Dementia continues to be the UK’s biggest killer, claiming the lives of 74,000 people in 2022.\nThis year marked a historic milestone with the licensing of two new Alzheimer’s drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, in Britain, the first in over 20 years. I am proud of the work we are already doing in Britain, but there is much more to do.\nI am therefore proud to say I have joined Alzheimer’s Research UK’s Dementia Research Champions programme, pledging to take action throughout 2025 that will help revolutionise the way dementia is treated, diagnosed and prevented.\nLocal News\nUniversity of Birmingham Parliamentors\nEvery year, I take part in the University of Birmingham Parliamentors scheme, to work with a diverse group of students of different faiths, to talk to them about a social action project they are working on, and share my experiences of trying to make change. It was lovely to talk to Becky, Jordh and Umar about their project.\nEdgbaston Labour Xmas Party\nTo wrap up a busy week, it was my pleasure to host the annual Edgbaston Labour Christmas Party for minced pies and mulled wine.\nIt has been a busy year, but I couldn't be more thankful to all the Labour members and supporters who have helped me get re-elected this year, as we delivered the first Labour government in 14 years.\nThank you all for the hard work, and merry christmas!\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

In 2017, another patient died following chemotherapy treatment for a lymphoma. Last year, an elderly man passed away after receiving an overdose of a chemotherapy drug and a woman, aged in her 50s, died after a misdiagnosis. There have been several other more ‘near misses’.\nAn inquiry from the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) into the Trust was commissioned following multiple reviews into the culture of the trust led by Professor Mike Bewick. These reviews highlighted serious concerns with patient safety and the bullying and harassment of staff at the Trust.\nPreet Kaur Gill has written to the Health Secretary on the back of these reports to ask what the Government is doing to improve the conditions at UHB for staff and patients. Last year, the Government said it would take swift action to monitor the reviews and subsequent recommendations.\nThe Edgbaston MP has worked closely with the Trust in her role as Chair of the Cross-Party Reference Group, which was set up by Gill to support the reviews. She has repeatedly pressed the Trust and the Government over UHB’s failures and closely monitored progress on the implementation of the review’s recommendations.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston and Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Public Health, said:\n“I’m seriously concerned to hear that four deaths have been linked to failures in University Hospital Birmingham’s blood cancer services. My heart goes out to the families and friends of those who have tragically died because of medicines mismanagement at the Trust.\n“This is far from the first time that issues have been raised regarding patient safety at UHB. For over a year I have been supporting reviews into patient safety at the Trust and working with its leadership to track those changes.\n“Clearly, there are still serious issues within UHB. I have written to the Secretary of State, asking what progress the Government has made to ensure UHB is a safe place for patients and staff. I will continue to hold the Trust to account until tangible change is seen across our hospitals.”",

These cover everything from mental health services to general surgery, cardiology and internal medicine.\nIn Preet’s letter to the Trust she outlines how “the latest waiting time statistics [at UHB] show that the percentage of patients being seen within the 18-week target (39.5%) is the second lowest in country, behind only Cambridgeshire Community Services (37%), which sees 40 times fewer patients.”\nAnd Ms Gill goes on to ask, “what reassurance you can provide to my constituents that UHB is taking steps to minimise the disruption this winter, support our valuable nursing workforce as best it can, and to bring waiting lists down?”\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said:\n“With the NHS approaching winter with the longest waiting times in its history and record shortages of staff, we must work to avoid further setbacks. Responsibility for that starts with the government but it is also why I wrote to Dr Rosser to ask what action is being taken locally.\n“Under this government, the British public now faces the worst access to health services of any country in Europe. It is completely unacceptable, and I am clear that this is no fault of our heroic NHS staff. They are slogging their guts out but there simply isn’t enough of them. That is why the Labour Party has pledged that we will train a new generation of doctors and nurses if we are elected to government.”\nWes Streeting MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said:\n“There were no strikes in the NHS during the 13 years when Labour was last in government. If we were in office today, we would be talking with the RCN and doing everything we can to prevent these strikes going ahead.\n“Government ministers spent the summer dodging calls and requests for meetings from the Royal College of Nursing. It is unacceptable negligence.\n“The Conservatives have stopped governing and it is nurses and patients who will be made to pay the price.”\nRead Preet's full letter here:",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-17-march/content_322.html": "My Weekly update - 17 March\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Mar 17, 2023\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Jan 30, 2024\nThis Budget was a chance for the government to unlock Britain’s promise and potential. But instead, they decided to continue papering over the cracks of 13 years of economic failure.\nDespite all the Chancellor’s claims, the Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded the UK’s long-term growth forecasts and confirmed that the hit to living standards over the past two years is the largest since comparable records began.\nThe only surprise was a handout for the richest 1% and their pension pots. This has been described by the Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves as “the wrong priority, at the wrong time, for the wrong people”. All it will achieve is widening the cost of living chasm. That’s why Labour has committed to reversing it.\nThis change has been introduced as basic rate taxpayers face an extra £650 in tax next year, and the country’s overall tax burden was projected upwards yet again. Labour will encourage doctors to stay in work by creating a targeted scheme as the government has done for judges, rather than create free-for-all for the wealthy few.\nI’m proud that with our mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, we will create good jobs and productivity growth across every part of our country. Where the government has thrown in the towel, Labour will build a better Britain.\nMy take on the West Midlands Devolution Deal\nI welcome the West Midlands Devolution Deal and any measure of money and resource that is brought forward to our region. However, this deal needed to go much further in its ambition to truly level up our region.\nThis deal has not resolved any of the long-term funding issues for local authorities that can truly unlock the potential of cities such as Birmingham. Local councils rely on the funding from Government. This deal does not undo the £800 million that has been taken out of Birmingham which has done irreparable harm to our city over the last 13 years by this Conservative Government.\nBirmingham’s Labour council has the bold vision to make this a golden decade of opportunity. It is disappointing that this Conservative Government and this Conservative Mayor do not have the desire to meet this ambition. This is simply a continuation of the begging bowl politics we have come to expect from this Government and yet more sticking plaster politics.\nOnly with Labour in power will we see the English towns and cities truly take back control from Westminster. We will build a fairer, greener, more dynamic country where working people succeed, aspiration is rewarded, and where together, we unlock the pride and purpose in every community.\nThe rising need for the rising number of warm banks\n12,834 warm banks have opened across the UK to support the millions of low-income households who cannot afford to heat their homes. In West Midlands, the figure stands at 807, with over 200 of those being found in Birmingham alone.\nWarm banks are public venues that anyone can visit in order to keep warm and have been opened by local councils, community organisations and faith groups. The surge in warm banks comes amidst a fuel poverty crisis.\nLabour has announced plans to reduce energy costs and insulate homes, saving households up to £1,400 off their annual bills, not just for one year, but for years to come. This would be paid for by bringing in a proper one-off windfall tax on energy giants and spending that on a package of support for energy bills.\nI would like to thank all those across Birmingham and the West Midlands who are stepping up to support the most vulnerable, especially to all the community groups across my constituency of Birmingham Edgbaston. This is vital work that is happening in the absence of any government support, but it shouldn’t have to be like this.\nToo often this burden is falling to local councils and the third sector without the strategy and resources in place to make the difference to people who are becoming desperate. With energy bills set to soar in April it’s a disgrace that Rishi Sunak’s Government is entirely missing in action and is yet to lift a finger.\nLabour would bring in a proper windfall tax to stop the energy price cap going up in April, insulate millions of homes, and save families hundreds on their energy bills for years to come.\nVisiting Year 6 at St Mary’s School\nThis week I had the pleasure of visiting Year 6 students at St Mary’s Primary School in Harborne. It was wonderful to hear about the work which they have been doing on democracy, Parliament and universal suffrage. They asked such insightful questions on my work as their local MP and it was great to see some potential future MPs in the making.\nAs shadow cabinet minister for international development, I was especially impressed that they have been learning about social justice and why it is so important that we support refugees. What was clear from my visit to the school was just how much young people care about development. The work they have been doing as part of Cafod's learning programme shows the need to do more around the world to support climate-impacted countries where food and water are scarce. However, as one young student said to me, “there is enough for everyone if we just share it.”\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Antenatal classes, health visitors, parenting support, baby and toddler groups and access to affordable, high-quality early education and childcare – all are vital to guiding parents and supporting child development. Yet over 80% of parents have said they struggled to access services.\nAs part of our Plan for Change we’re committed to strengthening and joining up family services to improve support through pregnancy and early childhood and improve long term outcomes for children - including through today’s investment in Family Hubs and the Start for Life programme.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said:\n“As an ex-children's services manager, I am absolutely delighted that families and children in Birmingham, Edgbaston will be able to access early years support through this funding boost from the Government.\n“Families in Birmingham, Edgbaston elected a Labour government to give every child the best possible start in life, and that is what we’re delivering.\n“Given the cuts to children's centres made by the last government, this will make such a huge difference for so many families in our community and I know that the impact will be felt for years to come.”\nAndrew Gwynne, Minister for Public Health and Prevention, said:\n“This crucial investment provides a strong foundation to deliver our commitment to raise the healthiest generation of children ever, by giving parents the support they need to ensure their baby has the best start in life.\n“The first two years of a child’s life lay the building blocks for their physical and emotional wellbeing into adulthood. That’s why we are investing in early years, as part of our Plan for Change, to improve access to services in deprived areas to ensure no-one is left behind.”\nENDS\nNotes for editors\nAround £57 million will be made available to 75 local authorities with high levels of deprivation in 2025-26. This will provide a raft of support through Start for Life services to families with babies, from pregnancy up to the age of two.\nIt comes on top of the £69 million announced in the Budget for a network of family hubs, which act as a one-stop-shop for families to get help with infant feeding advice, parenting classes and perinatal mental health support, among other areas.\nThe figures below are provisional funding allocations that the 75 programme local authorities will be eligible to receive for the financial year 2025-26.

Once again, we live in an era where peace in Europe depends upon strength and deterrence. That’s why the Prime Minister has announced the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War.\nThe Prime Minister also announced a deal with Ukraine that allows them to use £1.6 billion of UK Export Finance to buy 5,000 air defence missiles, manufactured in Belfast. That will enable us to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for peace, and create new jobs and apprenticeships in our country.\nThe Prime Minister has announced thousands of small UK businesses will now receive government support to ensure they benefit from the decision to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. This will include a new support hub to provide guidance to small businesses on accessing the defence supply chain, unlocking new jobs and putting more money in people’s pockets.\nYou can read the Prime Minister’s full statement delivered to the House of Commons on Monday here, and find out more about how small businesses are set to benefit from increased investment here.\nLeasehold\nSpeaking to LBC about the archaic leasehold system in 2020\nMany of my constituents who are leaseholders have been let down by unreliable managing agents like FirstPort, facing punitive and escalating ground rents, unreasonable or extortionate charges and onerous conditions.\nThe Government has published the Commonhold White Paper, which will seek to put an end to to the feudal leasehold system. Under our plans, homeowners will have a stake in the ownership of their buildings from day one, not have to pay ground rent, and will gain control over how their buildings are run. Read more about our plans here.\nRail Reform\nFor far too long, my constituents have been consistently let down by an unreliable rail network. Avanti West Coast and Cross Country, which connect Birmingham to the rest of the country, have two of the highest cancellation rates of any operators.\nThe government has announced that stations will now have to display how often trains are delayed, ushering in a new era of accountability and putting passengers first. You can read more here.\nEmployment Rights Bill\nShowing my support for a New Deal for Working People\nThe Government has tabled amendments to the Employment Right’s Bill this week, our historic bill which will increase productivity, improve worker’s rights and create the right conditions for long-term sustainable, inclusive, and secure economic growth.\nAn amendment tabled by the government will bring forward landmark changes to statutory sick pay that will help people stay in work and grow the economy. Under new plans, more than a million people across the country on low wages will either receive 80% of their average weekly earnings if they find themselves ill, or the rate of Statutory Sick Pay which will be £11.75 a week from April.\nThis Government is boosting living standards by making low earners better off and enabling people to have the time off they need to recover, so they can get better and remain in work rather than risk quitting altogether.\nOther Government amendments include applying zero hour contract measures to agency workers, more reforms to trade unions, such as simplifying industrial action notices, and regulating umbrella companies.\nRead more here.\nWork Coaches\nThe Government has announced that work will be unlocked for thousands of sick and disabled people through new measures that will bolster the support offered in Jobcentres and make the welfare system more sustainable. 1,000 work coaches are set to be deployed to deliver intensive employment support to sick and disabled people, helping them break down the barriers to opportunity, drive growth and unlock the benefits of work. Read more here.\nJustice\nThe Conservatives left us with record court backlogs, meaning victims faced huge delays to justice. Rape victims are staggeringly waiting more than 300 days on average just to see their perpetrators charged. This is a disgraceful legacy and we are determined to turn things around.\nThe Government has announced that victims will see swifter justice, with Crown Court sitting days to be increased to record levels. Crown Court judges will sit for a collective 110,000 days in the next financial year – 4,000 more than was previously allocated the previous year. You can read more here.\nWe have also committed to fast-tracking rape cases through the courts, introducing specialist rape courts to deliver swift and effective justice to some of the most vulnerable victims in the criminal justice system.\nUK-Ireland Summit\nThe Prime Minister met with Taoiseach Micheal Martin at a UK-Ireland Summit to discuss national security, growth and energy security. Through a new data sharing agreement, the UK and Irish governments will lay the groundwork for commercial developers to increase offshore energy. You can read the Prime Minister’s remarks here.\nDentistry\nPreet Kaur Gill speaking at the British Dental Association Conference\nThis government inherited an oral health crisis. The most common reason that children 5-9 go to hospital is for treatment for rotting teeth, and a third of 5-year-olds in the most deprived areas have experience of tooth decay.\nWe are delivering supervised toothbrushing to young children aged between 3 and 5 years old and families who are most in need of support. This includes providing 23 million free toothbrushes and toothpastes through our partnership with Colgate-Palmolive to reach up to 600,000 children each year. Read more here.\nNational Youth Strategy\nLocal authority spending on youth provision has reduced by 73% since 2010, which equates to over £1 billion less being spent on young people every year.\nThe availability of youth services can have a significant impact on the lives of young people. This week, the Government has launched a wide-reaching national survey asking about young people’s needs, challenges and priorities as part of the strategy to engage with young people to develop the National Youth Strategy. Have your say here.\nRestoring Pride in Britain's Neighbourhoods\nWith Mayor of the West Midlands Richard Parker\nThe Government has announced a record £1.5 billion will be handed to towns across the UK to tackle deprivation and turbocharge growth. A total of 75 areas will each receive up to £20 millions of funding and support over the next decade through the plan, which will help to transform multiple areas. Read more about our plans here.\nInternational Women's Day\nIn the UK, violence against women and girls is an epidemic. At least 1 in 12 women is a victim of domestic abuse each year, and nearly 100 domestic abuse related offences were recorded every hour by the police in 2024.\nAhead of International Women’s Day, it was a pleasure to speak at University of Birmingham and recommit to accelerating action to tackle violence against women and girls.\nThis Labour Government is committed to halving violence against women and girls in a decade. We have:\nPassed Raneem’s Law, placing domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms so when someone calls, they are listened to and heard. This is currently underway in the West Midlands.\nPledged to introduce new Domestic Abuse Protection Notices and orders to protect victims of all types of abuse such as physical, psychological, stalking and coercive control, meaning more perpetrators will be forced to live under restrictions.\nPledged to strengthen the use of Stalking Protection Orders and give women the right to know the identity of online stalkers.\nCommitted to making spiking a criminal offence, after incidents reached record levels last year.\nYou can read more about our plans to tackle violence against women and girls here.\nWorld Bank\nWith Ajay Banga, President of the World Bank\nIt was an honour to meet Ajay Banga, the President of the World Bank, in Parliament.\nInternational development is integral to our national security. We should be proud of the UK’s leadership in international development through the World Bank over the many years that we have worked together.\nGlobal Partnership for Education\nWith Laura Frigenti, GPE CEO\nIt was great to meet with Laura Frigenti, CEO of Global Partnership for Education in Parliament yesterday.\nI’ve been championing the Global Partnership for Education’s work for many years. We discussed our shared commitment to providing quality education to children in lower income countries, which we know is vital to the development of stronger economies across the world.\n3D Guns\nThis week, a man in Crewe was jailed after he was found with a loaded 3D-printed gun.\n3D guns are increasingly presenting a threat to our safety and security up of our country. I’m glad that the government is taking forward my bill and legislating to make it an offence to possess and share templates for 3D-printed guns.\nYou can watch the Channel 4 Documentary I featured in about 3D guns here.\nGG2 Awards\nIt was great to attend the GG2 Leadership and Diversity awards, with a keynote speech from Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.\nThank you to Kalpesh and Shailesh Solanki for a wonderful celebration of the contribution ethnic minorities make to the UK.\nBrain Tumours\nAt the Brain Tumour Charity drop-in\nBrain tumours are the largest cancer killers of those under 40, and 12,000 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year in the UK.\nIt was good to meet with the Brain Tumour Charity in Parliament to learn more about this condition.\nWorld Book Day\nAt World Book Day Parliamentary drop-in\nThis week it was World Book Day. Reading for pleasure really matters, with research suggesting that reading for pleasure is the single biggest indicator of a child’s future success – more than their family circumstances, their parents’ educational background or their income.\nWorld Book Day makes a difference. 25% of pupils receiving Free School Meals said the £1 book they \"bought\" with their £1 token was the first book of their own. It was great to meet with representatives from World Book Day in Parliament and show my support for this great initiative.\nLocal News\nPACT Meeting\nAt a morning briefing with West Midlands Police\nOn 21 March, there is a police and community (PACT) meeting in Quinton between 7pm and 8pm, at St Faith and St Laurence Church, Balden Road and Croftdown Road, B17 8RD.

Just 253 people were convicted of people smuggling last year. At the same time, almost 46,000 people crossed the Channel. It is estimated that the annual profits made by the criminal smuggling gangs operating the small boat crossings has surged to almost £200 million.\nLabour has committed to creating a new cross-border police unit funded by redirecting the millions of pounds being wasted by the Conservative Government on the unworkable Rwanda scheme.\nCracking down on criminal smuggler gangs is integral to Labour’s new security plan. We will:\nSeek a new Security Agreement with Europe in government to tackle people smuggling and bring gang-leaders to justice, including:\nReal-time data and intelligence-sharing on suspects – Labour will work with European partners to introduce a new real-time intelligence sharing system to replicate the functionality of programmes, like SIS II, that Britain lost access to as part of the Conservatives’ botched Brexit deal.\nA new partnership with Europol that enables the UK to play a leading role in partnerships to combat migrant smuggling across Europe – putting Britain’s police at the heart of pan-European efforts to counter people smuggling, bring gang leaders to justice and seize vessels being used in small boat crossings.\nMore UK police officers posted to Europol to coordinate joint investigations – specialist investigators from Labour’s Cross-Border Police will be stationed in the UK and across Europe focused solely on disrupting people smuggling and organised crime.\nA new Serious and Organised Crime Strategy, with a specific focus on tackling criminal smuggling gangs, including:\nStrengthening civil orders, such as existing Serious Crime Prevention Orders, to ensure they can be properly used against smuggling and trafficking – this would enable the NCA to introduce restrictions on the movement and operation of those suspected of being involved in smuggling and trafficking people to the UK in advance of criminal convictions.\nEnsuring close cooperation between the NCA and GCHQ on the surveillance of people smugglers and traffickers – enhancing existing joint operations between the two agencies to more effectively track and disrupt the activity of criminal smuggling gangs.\nIn Parliament\nThis week in Parliament, in my new role as Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Public Health, I spoke in a general debate about community pharmacies.\nChemists do far more than just dispense repeat prescriptions and sell shampoo. They provide a range of clinical services and have a key role to play in public health and preventative care.\nHowever, after 13 years of Tory government, the rising cost of doing business has meant many pharmacies are closing their doors for good, disproportionately in the most deprived areas. Staffing is also a tangible issue – two thirds of contractors said they found it “very difficult” to fill pharmacist roles last year.\nI asked the Government what assessment it has made of the risk of more pharmacies closing down and the impact this will have elsewhere. I also asked the Minister what his long-term strategy is to equip pharmacies for a future where their talents, capacity and expertise can be fully utilised and fix the front door of the NHS.\nJagtar Singh Johal\nThis week, as chair of the APPG for British Sikhs, I’ve been campaigning for the Government to call for Jagtar Singh Johal’s release.\nSix years down the line, it’s really concerning to see the Government backtracking on its commitment to call for Jaggi’s release. It’s unclear exactly what Rishi said when he raised the case of Jagtar Singh Johal to Modi last weekend, but given the significant pushback we have seen from him over the last year, it’s unlikely to be promising.\nIt is Foreign Office policy to call for a British National’s release if they have been arbitrarily detained. There should be no confusion over Jaggi’s position and no question over calling for his release. It will concern many in the UK that while Boris Johnson understood Jaggi to be arbitrarily detained, Rishi Sunak seems to hold a different opinion.\nRead more in an article by Birmingham Live:\nLocal News\nPolice\nThis week, I’ve been campaigning for more police officers on our streets and for Quinton Police Station to remain open.\nOn Sunday, a serious crime incident happened in Quinton, supposedly involving three men on scrambler-style e-scooters engaged in a drive-by shooting. Coincidentally, this happened just round the corner from the old police station.\nThis isn’t the only case of serious crime that I’ve seen in the constituency in recent months. This summer, I’ve seen rising cases of crime including illegal racing, speeding, vehicle-theft, burglary and ASB. My constituents desperately need a greater police presence with more patrols by West Midlands Police officers. Crucially, I need officers co-located in the constituency.\nSee both my letter to West Midlands Police and to the Police and Crime Commissioner below.\nMore also in an article by Birmingham Live:\nHeritage Week\nHistoric England is offering funding to help community and heritage organisations uncover and share hidden histories.\nFor more information about the scheme and how to apply, follow the link below.\nEdgbaston CLP Garden Party\nLast Sunday, it was fantastic to join the Edgbaston CLP for their annual fundraising garden party. It was great to see lots of new faces and a I would like to say a huge thank you to all our members who are working so hard for a Labour government.\nIt was also great to see some of our local councillors too. Thank you for all for the amazing work you do for the community.\nMHRC\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Woodgate Valley Park, Bartley Green, B32 3DS, on Tuesday 19th September, Meadow Road, Harborne, B17 8BU, on Wednesday 20th September, and Shipbourne Close, Harborne, B32 2LH, on Thursday 21st September.

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_statement-from-the-uhb-cross-party-reference-group/content_400.html": "Statement from the UHB Cross-Party Reference Group\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Apr 4, 2023\n- 3 min read\nStatement from the Cross-Party Reference Group on the Phase One Bewick review into patient safety at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB)\nThe Cross-Party Reference Group has been appointed to provide input into the three reviews, hold them to account and provide independence by bringing together local voices.\nWe would firstly like to thank Professor Bewick and his team for leading this first phase investigation into patient safety at UHB. We recognise that the full extent of concerns together with recommendations will be addressed in the subsequent two phases of this review.\nStaff welfare, culture and morale all play an important factor in patient outcomes and overall patient safety. The culture of fear that has been created is evident to see throughout this report and while this will be further explored in a succeeding phase, we remain concerned about the defensiveness so clearly on display. The allegations made by whistleblowers were not isolated incidents, but the result of a deep-seated and toxic culture. While Dr David Rosser has recently announced his retirement, one member of staff, albeit a Chief Executive, cannot be responsible for this alone. Feedback from staff has made it clear that there must be collective accountability by the senior leadership for the distressing culture afflicting the Trust. This has had a devastating impact on the lives of many staff who go to work in an NHS environment which has sadly led to many leaving the Trust and the tragic suicide of Vaish Kumar. We have seen this trend echoed in other NHS reviews for example, by Sir Bruce Keogh following the Francis Inquiry and Don Berwick’s report of ‘a promise to learn, a commitment to act’. Therefore, the Group will meet with the organisation leading the culture review of UHB to have oversight of the terms of reference and composition of the working group.\nGiven Professor Bewick had just six weeks to investigate and has only been able to offer limited recommendations, the report still paints a disturbing picture of serious failings at UHB. When a person goes to hospital, it is a worrying time for the patient, and they should not have to face additional concerns about the quality of care they may receive. We do remain concerned about above average mortality rates and the number of ‘never events’. As such, we must understand what monitoring, as suggested by Professor Bewick, will be put in place? We would also like to understand what the threshold is which would trigger an external review?\nWhile the report says that it is satisfied with the leadership team, we continue to hear concerns from staff about whether those leaders who have presided over the bullying culture will be able to change their leadership style to create a positive culture and command the trust of staff. We must now hear from the new Chairman about the appointment process of Non-Executives Directors that have taken place, those that remain, the diversity which they represent, and the development of reviews of NED including, monitoring and attendance. This will be a vital part to both patient and staff confidence in the Trust.\nThere are also several gaps in the report including the lack of recommendation resulting from the conflicting CQC reports. We must be granted access to previous documents such as the Fit and Proper Person Review (FPPR) which have not been shared. Releasing these reports and details of the process and people involved in commissioning and carrying them out is important to help ascertain any conflicts of interest, whether decisions made have contributed to the propagation of UHB’s toxic culture, and whether these amount to a ‘cover up’.\nMany of the concerns that have been raised are deeply troubling and so, for the sake of patients and staff alike, the recommendations from the first phase of the three reviews must immediately be carried out with an implementation plan presented to the Group. We require clarity around the timescales for carrying out these recommendations and to understand where accountability lies.\nWhile it was reassuring to learn that Professor Bewick will be involved in all three phases, we require the assurance that the same transparency in publishing the next two individual phases of the review will apply. The Well-Led Review should be close to concluding but it is concerning no details have been shared with the group of its focus and whether the report will be made available.\nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust touches the lives of so many, at a time when patients are at their most vulnerable. The Cross-Party Reference Group wants them to succeed. It is therefore imperative that the reviews are seen as the beginning of the journey so that we can implement the learning and create a culture that fosters openness for better patient outcomes.\nNotes to Editors",

The Conservatives have failed to ensure people have the skills to meet business need in order to tackle the national skills shortages.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP, for Birmingham Edgbaston said: “I’m appalled that the West Midlands has lost over 21,000 apprenticeship opportunities. This is a fundamental part of the regional mayor’s responsibilities. What is the point of having a Conservative Mayor if he isn’t going to engage with his own Government and stand up for our region?\n“First it was the investment zones which were abandoned, then we were passed over in favour of party politics over the levelling up fund and now our region is being further let down by a lack of ambition in respect of skills and training.\n“Young people and adults are aspirational for their families’ futures and want to learn new skills to get new jobs and progress at work. But they are being let down, unable to find training opportunities. Labour will reverse this trend, giving businesses the flexibility they need to train people up with new skills, from digital technologies to the green skills needed to tackle climate change.”\nLabour will give businesses the flexibility they are asking for, in order to train their workforce and deliver growth. The next Labour Government will start by turning the Tories’ failed apprenticeships levy into a ‘Growth and Skills Levy’.\nThe Conservatives’ levy has seen millions of pounds unspent on skills and training, even as businesses report growing skills shortages. Labour will give businesses flexibility and would ensure this money is directed at a broad range of training courses which will include English, maths and digital skills.\nAs part of a wider package of reform, Labour will establish a new taskforce, Skills England, to drive forward a national mission, delivering the skills needed for the next decade. This will be driven by pushing power and decisions on skills spending out from Westminster to local communities.\nToby Perkins MP, Labour’s Shadow Skills Minister, said, “Boosting in skills and training opportunities will be essential to meeting the economic challenges we face and enabling people at every stage of their lives to learn, retrain and progress at work.\n“This builds on Labour’s commitment to embed essential digital and life-skills across the school curriculum, and ensure all young people receive professional careers advice and work experience so they leave education ready for work and for life.”\nENDS Notes to editors\nConstituency apprenticeships data: Apprenticeships and Traineeships: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-tables/permalink/f03f689f-ddff-4ef0-2d09-08dafaf734a0",

Average waits of 24 weeks makes Birmingham one of the hardest places in the country to book a driving test, with waits 3 weeks longer than the national average.\nTo open up more tests and break down barriers to opportunity, the Government has announced:\n• those in other DVSA roles who are qualified to examine will be asked to return to the frontline to provide practical driving tests\n• doubling the number of permanent trainers to skill up new driving examiners quickly\n• accelerated consultation to investigate the potential abuse of the driving test booking system and prevent bots from accessing tests\n• reintroduction of overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests\nUnder the previous Conservative government, waiting times at some test centres in Birmingham quadrupled. Taken together, the government aims for the measures to reduce driving test waiting times to seven weeks by summer next year.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP, Member of Parliament for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“Passing your driving test is a life changing milestone – but excessive waiting times for tests are preventing too many people from reaching that goal.\n“My constituents should not have to wait six months, travel to the other side of the country for a test and be ripped off by unscrupulous websites just because they can’t afford to wait.\n“The scale of the backlog Labour has inherited is huge, so I welcome the government’s plan – which includes training more examiners, redeploying trained examiners at the DVSA to the frontline, and tightening cancellation rules – to support more people to take their test.”\nNOTES\n1.

They will also be recognising the significant contribution citizens of the Commonwealth have made in conflicts, as they have stood side by side with our UK Armed Forces.\nThe UK’s servicemen and servicewomen continue to play a central role to protect British interests and values, from training Ukrainian troops to supporting NATO allies in Estonia.\nFollowing the launch of its national poppy appeal, the Royal British Legion (RBL) are back in local communities across the country to raise vital funds to support our armed forces communities.\nLabour is backing the charity’s efforts to encourage schools across the country to support the teaching of remembrance, to ensure its importance is passed on to the next generation.\nThe charity has developed a range of free teaching resources to be used in local schools or at home, with all of the lesson plans linked to the national curriculum for key stages 1-5.\nThe Member of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, Preet Kaur Gill MP, said:\n“During remembrance, we honour and remember the sacrifices made by service men and service women, veterans and their families.\n“From Flanders Fields to supporting our NATO allies to deter Russian aggression, our armed forces continue to protect us at home and abroad.

I thought of the million Indian soldiers, many of them Sikhs, who risked their lives for us as I lay a remembrance Khanda in the Garden of Remembrance this week.\n“I would also encourage all residents of Quinton, Harborne, Bartley Green and Edgbaston, whether young or old, to support the local poppy appeal and pass on the importance of Remembrance to the next generation.”\nShadow Defence Secretary John Healey MP, added:\n“Remembrance is a time when the nation comes together to honour all those who have served in our Armed Forces, present and past.\n“This year service personnel have played a leading role in the UK’s united support for Ukraine, coordinating supplies, training troops and supporting our NATO allies.\n“Above all we remember those we’ve lost in conflict through the years, who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep Britain safe. We will remember them.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors\nRoyal British Legion Poppy Appeal – ways to get involved: https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/poppy-appeal\nRoyal British Legion ‘Teaching Remembrance’ resources: https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/remembrance/teaching-remembrance",

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_weekly-update-10-march/content_223.html": "Weekly update - 10 March\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Mar 10, 2023\n- 5 min read\nUpdated: Jan 30, 2024\nRather than dealing with the serious problem of small boats crossings undermining our borders, encouraging criminal activity and putting lives at risk, this week the Prime Minister opted for more gimmicks and slogans. When Rishi Sunak stood in front of a lectern that read 'Stop The Boats', in my view this is a complete farce given he can’t even tell us when he will do this.\nIn the last decade, this government has introduced five plans to tackle illegal immigration and every single time they have made it worse.\nThanks to this Conservative Government, we are now at a point where small boat crossings are at record highs and asylum hotel bills have grown to £500m. Last year 18,000 asylum seekers were deemed ineligible. Just 21 were returned leaving thousands languishing in hotels not allowing anyone to move on.\nLabour leader Keir Starmer was absolutely right this week at Prime Ministers Questions when he said that Rishi Sunak should be apologising rather than gloating.\nShould the new Conservative Asylum Bill be brought forward and the Government continue to fail to negotiate return agreements, including with France and other neighbouring countries, it will mean tens of thousands more asylum seekers will end up staying in hotels indefinitely. The potential cost of this has been calculated as reaching as much as £25bn over the next five years.\nThe asylum system has been utterly broken by this Government. But there is a solution. Labour has a common-sense five-point plan:\n1. Crackdown on criminal smuggler gangs, through new Cross-Border Police Unit\nA Labour Government would redirect spending from the unworkable Rwanda scheme, which the government has admitted is subject to a very high risk of fraud, to set up a new cross-border police unit to crack down on smuggling gangs. This would include millions of pounds of new investment through the National Crime Agency. Officers would be based in the UK and throughout Europe to tackle the gangs upstream. This would be supported with an urgent review to identify the gaps in enforcement against smuggling gangs, with the findings used to lay out an Action Plan to be delivered by the NCA and Border Force, in collaboration with international allies and Europol.\n2. Clear the backlog and end hotel use\nThe Home Office is taking 10,000 fewer asylum decisions a year than they were in 2015, leaving people waiting in limbo for much longer and pushing up accommodation costs. Fast tracking cases for Albania and other safe countries, introducing triage and restoring proper casework standards and targets will mean quicker support for those who are refugees, much quicker returns for those who are not, and stopping costly hotel use.\n3. Reform resettlement schemes to stop people being exploited by criminal gangs\nLabour would redesign the existing resettlement schemes which are not currently working properly to prevent people being exploited by criminal gangs or making dangerous crossings – for example sorting the problems with the Afghan Resettlement Scheme or providing for refugees with family connections in the UK to be able to apply to resettlement schemes.\n4. New agreement with France and other European countries on returns and family reunion\nLabour would negotiate a new agreement which includes return agreements and properly managed alternative arrangements such as family reunion.\n5. Tackle humanitarian crises at source helping refugees in their region\nLabour would work in partnership internationally to address some of the humanitarian crises that are leading people to flee their homes including restoring the 0.7% aid commitment when the fiscal situation allows and strengthening support for the people of Afghanistan.\nSaving the 002 Bus Service\nDiamond Buses recently announced that they were looking to scrap the 002 service. This is a well-used service that connects Weoley Castle, through to Bartley Green and on to Merry Hill. When I heard that this key service was under threat, I wrote to the CEO of Diamond Buses and Transport for West Midlands. Local residents also undertook a petition which garnered much support.\nI was delighted this week to hear from Diamond Buses in a reply to my letter. In their response they explained how they have chosen to listen to residents and retain this bus route.\nBus services across the country are in disarray with financial gaps, driver shortages and pay freezes meaning more and more services are at risk. Next week on Thursday 16th March, strikes are due to take place on our bus services. National Express runs 93% of the West Midlands bus network and these will be where most bus routes will be affected. Do take care if you are travelling next week.\nThese strikes are now nothing new and simply represent yet another crumbling service. This week, Labour launched our plans for the biggest bus overhaul in 40 years with new powers over operators.\nThese plans would give local areas in England devolved powers to reinstate cancelled routes and set affordable fares and would be introduced within months of a Labour government taking power. It is part of Labour’s wider “take back control bill” that would give authorities powers to start their own publicly owned bus services.\nOur bus services are relied upon by millions of people across the UK. In fact, twice as many people use buses as those who catch trains. That is why fixing this fundamentally system is so vital.\nStanding up against violent threats and abuse\nIt has become increasingly common for MPs to receive abuse. More recently, I have been on the receiving end of these type of violent threats in the past.\nMore recently though I received a direct and brazen threat telling me to “watch my back”. It was brazen as it was sent from someone’s work email address, making no attempt to hide their identity. It’s a worry because I’m with my daughters in the constituency all the time. My family live here. It really puts into context the kind of job that you do.\nI want to be clear though. These types of threats will never prevent me carrying out my duties as Birmingham Edgbaston MP. I will proudly continue to work on behalf of my residents.\nIf you’ve been to one of my advice surgeries recently you will have seen that I now always have a security officer with me. This is why. I don’t want to restrict my surgeries. I don’t want to go to an appointment-based system. I want to be able to be open and be in my community and make sure that people feel that they can have that access to myself. But I must do it while feeling safe and while protecting my staff.\nCelebrating International Women’s Day\nn Wednesday we marked International Women’s Day and sadly, this day remains as important as ever. Women accounted for 60% of the total rise in relative poverty in the first ten years of Conservative rule. Today they remain on average £574 poorer than 13 years ago.\nLabour is proud to be the party of women’s equality. Previous Labour Governments always empowered women – the next will match that record and more. Our New Deal for Working People will introduce a raft of reforms to transform women’s working lives. This includes:\nPermitting enabling equal pay comparisons across employers.\nIntroducing a day one right to flexible working.\nStrengthening protections against redundancy for new mothers.\nReforming the failed parental leave system.\nInternational Women’s Day is a moment to glimpse real, transformative change. But for that to happen, we need a UK Government ready to truly stand with women around the world.\nIt is important that Britain stands not just with women at home, but with women overseas as well. Investing in local women’s rights organisations and backing women’s activists is also highly cost-effective. They are often the first and best line of defence during humanitarian emergencies and are best placed to centre the needs of women and girls.\nAs Labour’s shadow cabinet minister for international development, I set out in The Times Redbox how using Britain’s aid budget wisely - by channelling resources directly to women’s organisations and treating them as equal partners – Labour will reconnect with the women and girls this government has left behind.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Four years on from the 2019 general election, a changed Labour party, back in the service of working people, is ready to get Britain’s future back.\nLabour has set out five missions:\nGet Britain building again, with a target of 1.5m homes\nSwitch on Great British Energy, with families £1,400 better off a year with GB Energy\nGet the NHS back on its feet, with 2m extra appointments a year\nTake back our streets, with 13,000 more police officers and PCSOs\nBreak down the barriers to opportunity, with New Technical Excellence Colleges\nWith a mission-driven Labour government, hard work will be rewarded, aspiration will be backed, communities will have more control, and politics will serve your interests.\nThe Metro\nThis week, I wrote an op-ed for The Metro in support of the Formula for Change campaign, which calls on the Government to urgently review regulations around the sale of infant formula.\nThe price for infant formula is soaring, with the cheapest brand of formula shooting up by 45% in just two years, way above inflation. This means, on average, a single tin costs an eye-watering £12.\nRegulations should be in place to help families, not make life more difficult for them. However, currently there are restrictions in place preventing families from using loyalty cards and vouchers to purchase pricey infant formula.\nThese restrictions are clearly outdated, especially during a cost-of-living crisis.\nAll families should be able to feed their babies. With Labour, retailers will be able to accept loyalty cards and vouchers as payment for infant formula to help families feed their children.\nRead the article here:\nSmoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group\nIt was great to speak at the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group event this week and set out Labour’s commitment to ensuring pregnant women receive the support they need to quit smoking.\nLast year, 8.8% of mothers were smokers at the time of delivery – some 50% more than the government’s 6% target.\nLabour will take steps to create a smoke-free future, by making all hospital trusts integrate 'opt-out' smoking cessation interventions into routine care.\nLordswood Boys' School\nThis week, it was great to visit Lordswood Boys' School. It was really inspiring to hear about their character-driven approach to education, based on shared values and equipping young people to learn essential life skills.\nLabour will reform the education system, delivering a broader education and introducing a new curriculum which raises the importance of oracy and digital skills.\nLocal News\nChristmas Party\nIt was great to see everyone at the Edgbaston CLP Christmas Party this year! I am so grateful for all the hard work that our members do, and all the effort they put into campaigning all year round.\nI hope everyone who attended had a wonderful time and has a great Christmas break.\nOff Road Bikes\nMany of my constituents have contacted me concerned about off-road bikes and the associated anti-social behaviour which is terrorising our communities.\nI therefore recently contacted Simon Foster’s Office about whether any additional funding will be allocated to West Midlands Police off-road bikes team. He has confirmed that for some years our region did not have such a team, therefore he has invested proceeds of crime into establishing a new West Midlands Police off-road bikes team. He is also investing ASB Hot Spot funding that he successfully secured into this team too. Thanks to this, West Midlands Police now has six off road bikes and has trained ten specialist officers to ride these bikes.\nNational Grid Apprenticeship Scheme\nThe National Grid Apprenticeship Scheme is now open. It’s a great opportunity for young people to work to shape the future of energy in the UK.\nApply by following the link below.\nMHRC\nIn response to my letter requesting that the MHRC continue to service our community, the Council leader has provided me with an update on the future of the MHRC. He has said:\n\"It is too early to comment on the future of specific services, but I can assure you that keeping the streets of Birmingham clean and tidy will be a priority for the council. Once the savings plans are collated... the public will be able to have their say through our consultation process\"\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

As traffic on the motorway has got busier, the trees have matured to provide a natural barrier for the residents living on Clay Drive and Chichester Drive in Quinton.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “For the last year I have sought answers on behalf of my residents and have been made promises by Highways England that simply don’t stack up. There was no consultation before these trees were removed, let alone warning that the work would be taking place.\n“I have been to the houses which back on to the M5. I have been there when the trees were in place, and I have since they were cut down. You can’t miss the change in the noise level. It is now overwhelming. I also worry about what impact this is having on local air pollution.\n“My residents have waited long enough, in frustrating circumstances for answers and compensation. They have received neither. That is why we have now raised this with the ombudsman. There must be a proper apology made to all the residents this has affected and the sound and air pollution that is now being felt must be rectified.”\nIn her letter to the Ombudsman, the MP Preet Kaur Gill has called for:\nImmediate air quality monitoring to be installed on effected roads,\nThe installation of an acoustic barrier to replace the natural barrier that was provided by the trees,\nAn apology to all residents which have been impacted by the removal of trees,\nFinancial compensation for the impact these actions have had on residents.\nLocal resident, Melanie Davies of Clay Drive said, “While to the average person a few trees being removed might not sound like much, but the impact of 100 trees being ripped out has been devastating. What’s more, when we’ve tried to speak to Highways England, we’ve been talked down to and entirely dismissed. There was no consultation on this work and as a public agency, I think that is unforgiveable.\n“Despite living next to one of the busiest motorways in the country, it used to be a relatively quiet neighbourhood. During the Summer, I used to love to sit in my garden and enjoy being outside with friends and family. Now, that simply isn’t possible. Not only is the noise deafening, but the pollution that’s coming from the motorway has meant garden sheds have a thick layer of black dirt covering them and at night, we have the lights shining from the motorway into our homes.\n“I just want to go back to the peace we had before. This has been so stressful for so many of the residents here. We’ve seen house sales collapse and the value of our properties drop by as much as £30,000. It is only right that we see an apology issued to all residents from Highways England.”",

England has one of the oldest housing stocks in the developed world and one of the lowest rates of social housing replacement. The Conservative Government has also failed to retrofit the worst energy efficient homes, leaving families losing hundreds of pounds a year in heat loss and forced to deal with damp and mould in their homes.\nThe group questioned the speed with which the Government is set to release additional funding for insulation and energy efficiency, describing that budgeting this from 2025 \"is patently inadequate\".\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, \"68% of homes in Birmingham don't meet the basic energy efficiency standards. This is pushing fuel bills even higher at a time when the UK is in recession, unemployment is high and food prices are rising.\n\"It is simply not good enough for the Government to sit back for the next three years and wait for the next death to happen.

Our summit will strengthen our collective efforts to disrupt criminal networks and protect borders.\nOur Labour Government has deported 24,000 people with no right to be in the UK, including 3,500 criminals. We are securing our borders.\nLabour has also announced plans to force companies employing people in the gig economy to carry out eligibility work checks. This means rogue firms will no longer be able to take advantage of flexible working arrangements to turn a blind eye to illegal working. We will fine companies failing to carry out these checks up to £60,000 per worker.

Read more here.\nPolitics Live\nOn Tuesday, I appeared on BBC’s Politics Live to discuss the tariffs announcement anticipated from the White House that evening, the future of British steel, satisfaction in the NHS and Just Stop Oil.\nYou can watch the episode here.\nBusiness and Trade\nWith Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds\nOn Thursday, the Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds made a statement in the House of Commons responding to Donald Trump’s announcement on tariffs. He launched a four-week “request for input” from businesses on imposing retaliatory tariffs on the US if a trade agreement cannot be reached.\nThe US's decision on global tariffs will be concerning for many businesses in Birmingham and across the country. This government will always support UK industry, and we will continue our engagement with businesses as we determine our next steps. I would urge businesses who are concerned by the announcement on tariffs to visit GREAT.gov.uk for the latest updates.\nA trade war with the US is not in the interests of working people, and this Government will never play politics with people’s jobs. We will keep negotiating, keep cool and keep calm, rather than rushing into a kneejerk reaction.\nDecisions we take in coming days and weeks will be guided only by our national interest, in the interests of our economy and in the interests of putting money in the pockets of working people. We are prepared. Indeed one of the great strengths of this nation is our ability to keep a cool head. You can read more here.\nSchool-based Nurseries\nWith school children in my constituency\nOn Tuesday, we announced 300 new school-based nurseries will open this September. They will help parents get to work, provide access to childcare when they need it, and will save parents money.\nThe rollout of 30 government-funded hours of childcare will save parents up to £7,500 on average, and £450 a year will be saved through our free breakfast clubs in schools, which are launching this month.\nWe’re raising the bar for early years, delivering on our manifesto commitments and building a system that gives every child the best start in life. You can read more here.\nFE Colleges Funding\nSpeaking to students\nThe government has announced that further education colleges in my constituency will receive a £2,279,244 funding boost, reflecting the government’s priority to train the next generation of skilled workers and grow the economy. This funding is the first capital investment in two years, and will bolster the Labour government’s mission to break down the barriers to opportunity.\nNot only will the welcome cash injection fix crumbling buildings, it will also enable colleges to attract and retain learners, boosting the local economy and inspiring the workforce of the future. Read more here.\nCost of Living\nFrom 6th April, 12 million pensioners will see an uplift in their state pension by up to £470 this year. That’s because we are keeping our promise to protect the triple lock. The Pension Credit Standard Minimum Guarantee will also increase by 4.1% from April 2025. This will mean that more of the poorest pensioners will become eligible to receive pension credit.\nFrom 6th April, help to save – which supports those on low incomes to build savings with a 50% tax free bonus up to 1,200 – will be extended to all Universal Credit claimants who are in work.\nFrom 7th April, the government will increase the Carer’s Allowance weekly earnings limit from £150 to £196. Alongside this, Carer’s Allowance will increase by 1.7%, rising to £83.30 per week.\nFrom 7th April, millions of families will also see their Child Benefit increase. From 7 April 2025, parents will receive £26.05 per week - or £1,354.60 a year - for the eldest or only child and £17.25 per week - or £897 a year - for each additional child. Read more here.\nWe have also capped bus fares to £3, frozen fuel duty for another year and provided a £1 billion boost to extend Household Support Fund, which supports people with the cost of essentials like groceries, toiletries, and warm clothes, as well as providing further support with energy bills.\nWage Boost\nOn Tuesday, 3 million workers got a pay rise worth up to £1,400 a year and millions more will benefit from rising wages.\nThe National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage has risen to £12.21 for those 21 and over, and £10 for those aged 18-20. This represents a record increase in the minimum wage for those aged 18-20.\nIn our manifesto we promised to Make Work Pay. We are delivering on that promise.\nNHS\nBy ending resident doctor’s strikes, our Labour government has saved half a million appointments and operations and waiting lists have come down by almost 200,000.\nThe progress the Government has made in starting to fix the NHS after 14 years of decline shows the transformatory effect of Labour's Plan for Change.\nSince July, over two million extra appointments have been delivered – seven months early – and the waiting list slashed by 193,000, with patients up and down the country beginning to feel a real difference after a decade of neglect – and in some cases after waiting years to get the care they need.

It was great to chat about how their shop is supporting 1.5 million SMEs in the UK.\nLocal News\nBirmingham Bin Strikes\nSpeaking to ITV Central about the Birmingham bin strike\nEarlier this week, the council declared a critical incident in Birmingham regarding the ongoing bin strike.\nThe Minister for Local Government, Jim McMahon, made a statement in Parliament and visited Birmingham yesterday in an effort to end the bin strike. He said the Government will not hesitate to act if the Council needs support.\nI have been calling on Unite and the Council to get back around the table and end this dispute. 17 bin workers should not be holding a city of 1.2 million people to ransom. Unite should accept the fair deal that 80% of affected workers have taken.\nI also raised my constituents’ concerns in Parliament, after a constituent wrote to me to say that a resident had been bitten by a rat.\nLordswood Boys School Visit\nWith students at Lordswood Boys School\nIt was great to visit Lordswood Boys School this week, to meet students who have been working to produce 67 Easter hampers from the most vulnerable families across Birmingham. It was inspiring to see their commitment to providing care and support in the community.\nHarborne Hospital\nIt was great to visit Harborne Hospital, an exciting new healthcare facility in my constituency. It was a pleasure meeting staff and having a tour around the site.\nKenrick Centre\nI’ve been campaigning to save the Kenrick Centre, which supports adults with various needs and is a vital step-down service to support discharges from hospital. I’m glad that the Council has extended its Care Centres Consultation. Have your say here.\nStreet Surgery\nOn a street surgery in Bartley Green\nLast week, I conducted a street surgery in Bartley Green. I asked constituents about the issues that mattered most to them and have started working on some new cases.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

The reforms are part of the government’s Plan for Change to make general practice fit for the future and will support GPs in taking the first steps to end the 8am scramble for appointments, which so many patients currently endure every day - in turn improving access to GPs for everyone.\nThe deal for family doctors is backed by the biggest funding boost for General Practice in years, reversing the decade-long cuts to general practice funding as a share of the NHS budget.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“For too long, my constituents have found it near impossible to see their GP. I’m very pleased that the government is delivering on our manifesto commitment to bring back the family doctor and deliver a modern booking system to end the 8am scramble for appointments.\n\"Excellent primary care is the key to earlier diagnosis. That’s why our Labour government is reforming the front door to the NHS by cutting red tape and providing record funding for GPs.”\nHealth and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting, said:\n“Rebuilding the broken NHS starts with GPs. Patients need to be able to easily book an appointment, in the manner they want, with their regular doctor if they choose.\n“Today, we have taken the first step to fixing the front door to the NHS, bringing back the family doctor, and ending the 8am scramble.\n“Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared. That’s why patients are struggling to get an appointment.\n“This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs time and backing them with an extra £889 million next year. In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment. Through the Prime Minister’s Plan for Change, we will work with GPs to rebuild the NHS and make it fit for the future.”\nDr Amanda Doyle, NHS England national director for primary care and community services, said:\n“Improving patients’ access to general practice is a huge priority for the NHS and this contract sets out the next steps to put the family doctor at the heart of the shift to a neighbourhood health service.\n“This is the first time in four years that the GP contract has been accepted as proposed and I hope it will be seen as positive for practices, GP teams and patients when introduced in April.\n“It shows how NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have listened and delivered on the priorities that matter most to patients and general practice teams, including a significant increase in funding and extra flexibility in the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme to recruit more staff including GPs.”\nOther key changes include improved digital access for patients, setting out what patients can expect from their practice in a new charter and encouraging GP teams to identify patients with the greatest need that would most benefit from seeing the same clinician at every appointment.\nToday’s reforms will be underpinned by an extra £889 million to fix the front door of health, bringing total spend on the GPs contract to £13.2 billion in 2025/26.",

I had the privilege to hear him address Parliament where he thanked Britain for all of the support Ukraine has been given.\nAs Keir Starmer said, as a country we've always been at our best when we stand up to tyrannical aggressors, threatening their neighbours and peace.\nThat's why the Labour Party helped found NATO and why our commitment to NATO is as unshakeable today as it was back then.\nThe tragedy unfolding in Turkey and Syria\nThe tragedy that is unfolding in Turkey and Syria is immense. With a reported 21,000 deaths so far, I want to send my sincerest condolences to everyone with loved ones who have died or are missing due to the earthquakes.\nI know for the large Turkish, Kurdish and Syrian diaspora communities in the UK, that this is a very uncertain and distressing time as they wait for news back home.\nGiven the close ties of family and friendship between our countries, it is essential that the UK steps up and plays it part.\nI want to send my heartfelt thanks to the search and rescue teams that are already flying out to Turkey as we speak, including eight volunteers from West Midlands Fire Service. They are truly heroes, springing to action to help save lives within hours of the terrible news.\nIn the coming days and weeks, it is essential that the UK deploys more support to assist a swift and comprehensive humanitarian response. We know that in these kinds of emergencies, the first 72 hours are crucial.\nIt is essential that the Government does not let pressures on the aid budget hamper a swift and effective response. But yet again we are seeing chaos within the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office due to development experts not being allowed to get on with their job.\nDespite this, I am thankful that we live in such a generous country. The DEC appeal which was launched just yesterday to support humanitarian efforts has raised £30 million in just one day.\nNational Apprenticeship Week\nOver the last decade, new apprenticeship programmes have declined by 3,930 in Birmingham and incredibly by as many as 21,610 across the wider West Midlands region. The Conservatives have failed to ensure people have the skills to meet business need in order to tackle the national skills shortages.\nI’m appalled that the West Midlands has lost over 21,000 apprenticeship opportunities. This is a fundamental part of the regional mayor’s responsibilities. What is the point of having a Conservative Mayor if he isn’t going to engage with his own Government and stand up for our region?\nFirst it was the investment zones which were abandoned, then we were passed over in favour of party politics over the levelling up fund and now our region is being further let down by a lack of ambition in respect of skills and training.\nYoung people and adults are aspirational for their families’ futures and want to learn new skills to get new jobs and progress at work. But they are being let down, unable to find training opportunities. Labour will reverse this trend, giving businesses the flexibility they need to train people up with new skills, from digital technologies to the green skills needed to tackle climate change.\nI’m proud that the next Labour Government will give businesses the flexibility they are asking for, in order to train their workforce and deliver growth. We will start by turning the Tories’ failed apprenticeships levy into a ‘Growth and Skills Levy’.\nThe Conservatives’ levy has seen millions of pounds unspent on skills and training, even as businesses report growing skills shortages. Labour will give businesses flexibility and would ensure this money is directed at a broad range of training courses which will include English, maths and digital skills.\nAnd, as part of a wider package of reform, Labour will establish a new taskforce, Skills England, to drive forward a national mission, delivering the skills needed for the next decade. This will be driven by pushing power and decisions on skills spending out from Westminster to local communities.\nSpeaking at the Centre for Global Development\nThis week, it was an honour to be able to speak at the Centre for Global Development. It was fantastic to have aconversation withSir Mark Lowcock, who is the former UN Relief Chief, the Department for International Development (DFID)’s longest serving Permanent Secretary and current Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development.\nWe spoke about the UK’s role in development with topics ranging from climate to conflict-affected countries, Britain’s soft power and place in the world order.\nOut and about in the community\nThis week I had the pleasure of meeting with Paul Sansom, headteacher Chad Vale Primary. I was really pleased to see the school acting as leaders in active travel having joined the Modeshift STARs programme which encourage children and parents to walk, cycle and take public transport to school. They have also taken part in the Junior PCSOs programme to challenge poor parking and behaviour.\nI was outraged this week to hear that West Midlands Police has been asked by this Government to look after prisoners in Police custody cells due to acute overcrowding in prisons. We already have a shortage of officers, and we need those that we have out on the streets, not acting as prison guards. The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, Simon Foster, is absolutely right. It's outrageous the Government has the nerve to ask.\nI also visited Elmhurst Ballet School. This is a true asset in our constituency. It was wonderful to see and hear the school's philosophy that talent is classless. While it’s one of the top ballet schools in the world, they offer a genuine commitment to providing opportunities to young people regardless of their backgrounds. It was incredible to hear about everything that is happening ahead of celebrations of their 100th year.\nThe Government is looking to offer money to councils to buy homes to provide temporary accommodation for Afghan and Ukrainian refugees. This will be discussed by Birmingham city council next week as a bid for funding is to be prepared. An initial 30 homes could be bought under the scheme with the potential for another 20 to be added at a later date. However, I am concerned that the Government is giving some money to house asylum seekers but offers no money to support increased pressure on schools, GP practices and other services. Birmingham will always be a welcoming city, and proudly so, but the burden needs to be shared equally with the rest of the UK.\nAnd finally, we have the Mobile Household Recycling Centre returning to Edgbaston. The centre will be available between 7am – 12 pm on Elvetham Road, B15 2LZ, on Tuesday 21 February.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

The NHS needs investment and reform – in the case of the last Labour Government, this delivered the shortest waiting times and highest patient satisfaction in history.\nThat also means that this week, my time as Shadow Secretary for International Development has ended. It has been a great privilege to serve such an important role through a tumultuous few years: a global pandemic that has set the clock back on years of progress, the UK’s disastrous exit from Afghanistan, and Putin’s abhorrent war in Ukraine.\nI am proud of our work we have done holding the government to account: over its disastrous decision to abolish DfID and mismanaged aid cuts that have harmed so many lives. I want to thank everyone who I have worked with over the years. Britain should be immensely proud of the good it does in the world, and I will continue to be a strong advocate for international development.\nI wish my successor all the very best in the task of rebuilding Britain’s reputation as a development superpower and trusted partner on the world stage.\nITV Central\nThis week, I spoke to ITV Central about the rental crisis in Birmingham.\nMany of my constituents, through no fault of their own, are facing unaffordable rents and the threat of eviction.\nLabour has a plan to start fixing this crisis. Our Renters Charter will:\nBan section 21 evictions\nEnd automatic evictions for rent arrears\nIntroduce a national register of landlords\nMake deposits fairer and more flexible\nPermit pets\nAllow tenants to make reasonable alterations to their home\nRequire landlords to give 4-month notice periods\nGive tenants the right to request speedy repairs\nLabour will also build more affordable and social homes as part of our plan to return social housing to the second largest form of tenure.\nBirmingham City Council\nThis week, I spoke to BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5, BBC Radio WM, and Times Radio about Birmingham City Council, which issued a Section 114 notice as part of an overall strategy to restore its finances.\nThis is a very difficult time for the council, as it is no longer able to make any new non-essential spending commitments. My constituents will want to know what exactly what support the Government is going to provide to ensure key services are delivered. We do not have that information yet.\nThe problems facing Birmingham City Council are part of a wider problem facing local government. We've seen Tory-run Thurrock and Northamptonshire issue S114s. Sigoma have warned that up to 26 councils could issue a S114 in the next two financial years because of the deficit in funding.\nHaving said that, Birmingham City Council has its unique issues, and it is absolutely right that there is accountability and people are held to task for failure. I am confident that a process is in place to investigate and learn lessons. We can never be in this place again.\nAfghan Women\nThis week, it was a privilege to speak at the Reception in Honour of the Resilience, Bravery & Inspiration of Afghan Women, hosted by the amazing Zehra Zaidi.\nIt was a pleasure to work with so many inspiring Afghan women as Shadow Int. Development Secretary. I will never forget you.\nLocal News\nRAAC\nThis week, Woodhouse Primary Academy in Quinton has had to close over concerns of RAAC.\nIt is disgraceful that the Tories have failed our children yet again, putting their education and even their safety at risk. The next Labour government will make sure schools are fit for purpose and children are safe.\nI am writing to the Minister for Schools to ask if contingency plans are in place. Parents at Woodhouse, or any school dealing with issues related to RAAC, should contact me with any concerns so that I can raise them with the Government.\nHeritage Day\nNext Saturday at St. Germain’s Church, there will be arts and crafts workshops, quizzes, refreshments, church tours and more as part of Birmingham Heritage week! Do make sure to drop in.\nMHRC\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Balden Road, Quinton, B32 2ES, on Thursday 14th September. Please come along if you're local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

The crisis has meant many have resorted to pulling their own teeth out, with 1 in 10 people having attempted some kind of ‘DIY dentistry’.\nPreet Kaur Gill and Eddie Crouch’s visit to the dental hospital comes after the Government announced a set of measures to tackle NHS dentistry, which the Government’s own chief dental officer has suggested won’t fix the current crisis. The BDA have also dubbed the so-called ‘Recovery Plan’ as unworthy of the title.\nWhile NHS dentistry faces an immediate emergency, it also faces an existential crisis. Practices have been reporting significant issues with recruiting new NHS dentists. They have highlighted that the current dental contract disincentivises dentists from seeing new NHS patients, especially those with more complex needs. Practices unable to meet their targets have their funding clawed back, meaning frontline dentistry is missing out and NHS dentists are leaving to the private sector in their droves.\nThe Conservatives have promised to reform the dental contract for 14 years, but their announcement hasn’t promised any reform this side of a general election.\nLabour has said it is serious about fixing the long-term crisis in NHS dentistry by reforming the dental contract. In government, Labour has said it will meet with the BDA right away to start the critical work on reworking the contract.\nLabour will also grip the immediate crisis in NHS dentistry, offering 700,000 urgent appointments a year, a targeted recruitment scheme for areas most in need, and a national supervised toothbrushing scheme for 3 to 5 year olds.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said: “I know how hard dentists work, I know how skilled the profession is, and I know how valuable an NHS dentist is to a community. We can see the consequences now when communities don’t have NHS dentistry: children whose teeth hurt so much they are struggling to eat, thousands of children who are too self-conscious to smile, and deaths from oral cancers rocketing since 2010.\n“After 14 years, the Tories still haven’t got round to reforming the dental contract, and it didn’t appear in their so-called ‘Recovery Plan’. We can’t trust them to introduce the crucial change we need for a secure service in the long term. Labour is serious about contract reform. We will fix the immediate crisis in NHS dentistry as well as reform the service in the long term.”\nBritish Dental Association Eddie Crouch said: “The horror stories are true, and an ever-growing number of dental students are giving up on NHS dentistry before they’ve even graduated. If this service is going to have a future it needs to be a place the next generation of dentists would choose to build a career. These undergrads need to know that underfunding and failed contracts aren’t inevitable. That they have a chance to provide quality care to millions.”\nTiya Raithatha, 4th year student at the University of Birmingham School of Dentistry, said: “We all came here to the dental school with serving the public at the fronts of our minds. They’re patients, not customers, and our first priority is to help them. I’m increasingly worried that we won’t be able to do that. I hope the next government can deliver urgent change so my colleagues and I can work in the NHS and do right by our patients.”",

Jaguar Land Rover, which has a base in Solihull, announced last week that they would pause shipments to the US until they can address new trading terms.\nThe Prime Minister told workers at the Solihull factory that he would back workers to the hilt, and pledged a new wave of support for the sector. This included relaxed rules around fines for those who do not sell enough electric cars – and supercars, like Aston Martin cars, will be exempted. He reinstated the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, but regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will be tweaked to help firms in transition.\nIn his speech, Starmer also announced a £2.3 billion boost for manufacturing zero emissions vehicles. This will support Rolls-Royce, Vauxhall and Land Rover in the face of Trump’s tariffs.\nWe are disappointed the United States has introduced global tariffs – which will clearly have an economic impact here and across the world. We are fully focused on negotiating an economic deal with the United States that strengthens our existing fair and balanced trading relationship and mitigates some of the impact of what has been announced.\nThe Department of Business and Trade has asked businesses to share their views on potential UK measures responding to the new US tariffs. Find further information and how to respond here.\nIn the House of Commons, I commended the government for acting decisively to give British carmakers certainty and support. Watch my intervention below.\nState Pension Increase\nWith elderly residents at a Harborne care facility\nFrom this week, millions of pensioners are set to receive a £470 boost to their state pensions. This comes after the government confirmed a 4.1% increase in the state pension for 2025/6.\nThis Labour Government is committed to delivering for our pensioners – ensuring their financial stability through the triple lock, fixing our NHS and public services, and targeting support towards those who need it most. Read more here.\nGPs\nOutside Jiggins Lane Medical Centre\nI’m thrilled that new figures show that over 1,503 extra GPs have been hired through our new scheme since 1 October. This major recruitment boost came after this Labour government removed red tape which made it difficult for surgeries to hire doctors.\nThe increased GP capacity will help fix the front door of the NHS and increase appointments to bring back the family doctor. This milestone comes after successfully cutting waiting lists by 219,000 and delivering 3 million NHS appointments. Read more here.\nIsrael-Gaza\nIntervening in Parliament to show express my support for my colleagues\nIn the House of Commons, I paid tribute to two Labour MPs – my friends and colleagues – who were refused entry to Israel last Saturday.\nI asked the Minister if he agreed with me that it's essential delegations can visit the region, as that is the only way that we listen, learn and are exposed to a wide range of views.\nBins\nSpeaking to ITV Central about the bin strike at the end of last week\nThe current industrial action in the city is causing misery and disruption to local residents, with waste building up on the streets during these strikes. Worryingly, this is causing serious public health risks to the city’s most vulnerable.\nIn parts of my constituency, small piles of rubbish have transformed into huge mounds of flytipping over the last few weeks.\nYesterday, Angela Rayner urged striking Birmingham bin workers to accept an improved deal. I have also been calling for Unite to get back around the table and bring an end to these strikes.\nIt is in the interest of all parties, and most importantly it is for the benefit of Birmingham’s residents, that this industrial action is brought to a close in a meaningful and sustainable way as soon as possible.\nWe need to reform the waste service so that it represents good value for the taxpayer. The strikes must end now – there is a fair deal on the table.\nPolice\nAt a morning briefing with West Midlands Police\nOn Thursday, the government introduced plans to make communities safer and restore trust in policing by putting police officers back in our neighbourhoods.\nNew measures will ensure every community will have dedicated and specialist neighbourhood policing teams, ending the postcode lottery. We will also ensure a named, contactable officer is brought in for every area.\nOur Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee will put 13,000 more officers into neighbourhood policing roles by 2029, an increase of more than 50%. As part of this, West Midlands Police is set to get 150 more neighbourhood police officers, and an additional 20 police community support officers. Read more here.\nUniversal Theme Park\nI welcome news that this government has secured a multi-billion-pound investment that will see Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe, firmly putting the country on the global stage.\nSet to open in 2031, the theme park will form part of a new planned entertainment resort, due to include immersive storytelling, rides, attractions and hospitality.\nThis is a massive vote of confidence in our country, and is estimated to bring a £50bn boost for the economy. It will also combine local and national growth, creating around 28,000 new jobs across sectors such as construction, AI, and tourism. Read more here.\nVaisakhi\nIt was a pleasure to attend a wonderful Vaisakhi event, hosted by Prime Minister Keir Starmer at No 10. Downing Street.\nSikhs make a huge contribution to Britain, and at the event, the PM affirmed his respect for Sikh values of fairness, equality, service and justice.\nI would like to wish everyone celebrating on Sunday a happy and peaceful Vaisakhi.\nLocal News\nExempt Accommodation\nWith residents and Cllr Sharon Thompson outside problematic property Saif Lodge\nThe explosion of under-regulated exempt accommodation in Birmingham is an issue I have been raising for years. Campaigning with the council, the police and residents, we shut down the problem hostel Saif Lodge in my constituency, secured debates in Parliament, compiled and submitted evidence to Ministers, and helped finally secure legislative change.\nAfter repeated delays under the Tories, I am pleased that Labour are finally getting on with the job of introducing these reforms. It's not right that those who are paid to house some of the most vulnerable in society don't have to meet robust minimum standards of care, quality or support.\nAs pilots in Birmingham have shown, poor provision is rife, and it is no wonder some properties have become magnets for antisocial behaviour and crime.\nI look forward to working with the government to bring in these long overdue reforms. Vulnerable adults deserve better support; residents deserve safer neighbourhoods; and the taxpayer deserves assurances their money is going to those who need it most.\nI spoke to Birmingham Live about the exempt issue in our city. Read the full article here.\nWest Midlands Innovation Accelerator\nMeeting entrepreneurs in health tech with Mayor Richard Parker\nIt’s excellent news that the West Midlands Innovation Accelerator has been given £10 million from the Government. This money will go towards providing expert advice and grants to help develop products and technologies in the region.\nI visited several businesses taking part in the health tech innovation accelerator with our Mayor Richard Parker earlier this year. It was a pleasure to meet so many inspiring entrepreneurs pioneering breakthroughs in health tech.\nBunting\nDowning Street is inviting schools and young people across the country to take part in a special creative competition to design bunting for 10 Downing Street for VE Day.

Here’s some more things our Labour government just delivered:\nThree million workers got a pay rise this week through increases to the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage\nFirst 300 new school-based nurseries announced\n1,000 flood defence projects announced, protecting 66,500 properties\nExtra £617 million over two years for community pharmacies\n£302 million cash injection to fix further education colleges\n24,000 people returned with no right to be here since the General Election (including 3,500 criminals)\nConfirmation of 500,000 vital NHS appointments and operations saved by ending strikes straight after the General Election\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

Launched at Cranfield University in September 2019, using effective, efficient, and up-to-date industry news the programme reached a record 776,000 young people under the age of 24 during 2023 - making it one of the largest STEM programmes in the UK.\nThe programme aims to guide young people into their future careers by providing free-of-charge independent careers advice, whilst at the same time building up a huge pool of interested and engaged young people who are potential future interns, apprentices and employees for this huge business sector.\nWorking with industry, the programme works with those in the 12 to 24 age group with age relevant material to inspire young people from all backgrounds into their dream careers.\nIf you are interested in hearing more about the program and what it can offer to the students at your school, please get in touch directly with Tony Hoskins on tony@spitfireaa810.co.uk.'\nIf any educator, parent, or student would like to discuss the above with Preet further, please contact preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk or telephone 0121 392 8426.",

Preet Kaur Gill MP has argued that these fees will impact vulnerable residents and those with loved ones in care homes most.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said, “This is yet another instance where the Government is all about the headlines but light on detail. The Government is asking the public to pay for lateral flow tests from 1 April, but this is just the wrong timing. While we won’t need free lateral flow tests on a long-term basis, we are once again seeing a sharp rise in cases.\n“By asking the public to pay for tests, this cost will hit hardest those who are medically vulnerable and people who have family members in care homes. This pandemic has already ravaged our care homes thanks to this Government’s dither and delay. We shouldn’t now be asking families that have been through enough, to pay simply to see their loved ones.”\nVisiting arrangements in care homes have sought to prioritise the health, safety and wellbeing of patients and staff. The impact of these measures has been widely felt with thousands of families unable to see their loved ones, affecting the physical and mental health of residents. Lateral Flow Tests have enabled some of these stringent measures to be lightened. Since the Government’s announcement, Preet has had many constituents write to her asking that the Government delays in introducing this extra cost at a time when the cost of living is skyrocketing.\nPreet continued, “I have residents telling me how with energy and fuel cost rising, they are struggling to put food on the table. To then have an added cost for lateral flow tests will have a huge impact on whether families can afford to visit elderly and vulnerable relatives. It’s a disgrace.”\nFor the 11,960 people living with dementia in Birmingham, free lateral flow device (LFD) tests are particularly important.\nOne such resident was Celia Moore in Edgbaston who regularly visits her mum who is living in elderly living accommodation and is suffering from dementia. Ms Moore said:\n“Lateral flow tests are an absolutely vital part in keeping my Mum safe. A local chemist has recently announced that a pack of five LFD tests will cost £12, meaning that to visit my loved one on a daily basis, I’d face a monthly cost of £73. When these visits are priceless for both of us, it’s wrong that I should have to pay just to visit my Mum.\n“The Prime Minister has said that the focus must remain on protecting the most vulnerable in our society. Yet, care home residents have had to bear the brunt of the pandemic, particularly in its early stages. The discharge of thousands of hospital patients to care homes, mostly without testing, led to significant infection rates and huge numbers of premature deaths. Without free testing for care home visitors, the Government is at risk of repeating its dangerous mistakes.”",

He invited people to buy a new kettle.\nWhile his solutions to the cost of living crisis were weak, his analysis of why we are in this mess were hardly any better. The Conservative Prime Minister sought to blame the last Labour government, from over 12 years ago, for the UK’s dismal energy resilience, which has left the UK facing some of the highest inflation in Europe. In a characteristically misleading style, he claimed Labour did ‘absolutely nothing to develop this country’s nuclear industry’.\nThe reality, of course, is that in 2009 then Prime Minister Gordon Brown approved the go-ahead for ten nuclear power stations. It was the Conservatives that came to power in 2010 that cancelled the plans and didn’t build them.\nIndeed, under the Tories, we have suffered twelve years of dither, delay, and poor planning on Britain’s energy sector. The nation’s gas storage was slashed and sold off, they failed to regulate the market, failed to invest in renewables, and have left UK homes some of the worst insulated in Europe. The result of which is a nation uniquely exposed to the energy crisis, with households hit with unaffordable energy costs at a time when everything else is also going up.\nInstead of trying to blame everyone else, the Tories must look at themselves and accept that it is their policy decisions that have caused the mess we are in today.\nIn contrast to the zombie Tory Government, Labour has a plan to rebuild Britain’s energy security, reduce our reliance on foreign gas and bring down people’s bills. We would deliver a mass home insulation programme, saving people £1,000 a year; invest in renewables, including onshore and offshore wind, hydrogen and solar; and end the delay on nuclear power.\nCrucially, we will stop the price cap rise by taxing windfall profits of the oil and gas giants to make sure families do not pay a penny more on their energy bills this winter.\nThe Tories have proven they have no plan to address the scale of the energy crisis. Only Labour can give Britain the fresh start it needs.\nCalling on the Foreign Secretary to act on Pakistan floods\nWe have all been shocked by the images coming from Pakistan this week. 50 million people have been displaced; over 1,000 people have died; and more than 287,000 homes destroyed. A third of the country – an area roughly equivalent to the size of the UK – is now under water.\nThe scale of the disaster is incomprehensible, and I am worried the situation will worsen as more rains are expected.\nMany people across our country and constituency have close ties to Pakistan and will be worried sick for their loved ones. It is therefore essential the UK plays its part to meet the scale of this challenge.\nThat is why, this week, I wrote to the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, calling on the UK to convene with international counterparts to coordinate and scale up a proportionate response to this crisis.\nI’m glad that following Labour pressure, a new package of support was announced yesterday. It is essential that support is disbursed quickly to reach those in greatest need.\nRaw sewage dumping in Edgbaston\nThis week you may have seen stomach-turning footage on the news of raw sewage being piped directly into the sea at beaches across the UK. Sadly it is not just Britain’s beautiful coastline that is suffering from this rank practice, however...\nThis week, Labour analysis of Environment Agency data has revealed the scale of raw sewage dumping in Birmingham. With our country facing a dirty water emergency, and water companies failing to face up to the problem, the scale of sewage discharge by Severn Trent is stomach-turning.\nFigures show that, Severn Trent dumped 253 hours’ worth of raw sewage into Birmingham, Edgbaston’s natural environment last year. 225 hours’ worth of raw sewage was dumped into the River Rea at the Pershore Road storm overflow alone. I know constituents will be sickened by this, knowing that this is killing our beautiful brooks, rivers, and natural environment.\nLast year, I and the Labour Party backed an amendment to the Environment Bill that would have eliminated this disgusting practice. Incredibly, the Conservative government voted against.\nI am staggered that Conservative MPs ignored Labour’s warnings – including Gary Sambrook, the MP for Birmingham, Northfield. As a result, water companies are using Birmingham’s rivers and brooks like open sewers.\nThis new analysis comes amid revelations last week, that prime ministerial hopeful Liz Truss was responsible for unleashing cuts of tens of millions of pounds to the Environment Agency, with data showing that the Tories presided over a doubling of water companies dumping raw sewage in subsequent years. As Environment Secretary and Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Truss in fact failed to hold a single meeting with a water company to discuss their performance of sewage dumping. Her record inspires little hope for the future of our waterways and environment if she becomes Prime Minister next week.\nIn contrast, a Labour government will use the levers of power to hold reckless water bosses to account and toughen regulations to prevent them from gaming the system. We will ensure there can be enforcement of unlimited fines, holding water company bosses legally and financially accountable for their negligence, and by toughening up regulations that currently allow the system to be abused.\nCheck The Rivers Trust interactive map for yourself below.\nCommonwealth Games equipment giveaway\nThe Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games saw incredible sporting action, record ticket sales and viewing figures, and shone a spotlight on our talented region and people.\nNow, the organising committee of the Games, working with Sport England, is looking to give away more than 16,000 sports items used at our Games.\nThe items, which include bikes, martial arts mats, weights, T20 cricket equipment, basketballs, boxing gloves and weights, as well as general equipment, such as cones and bibs, are being made available to local sport and community groups across the West Midlands.\nThe community giveaway will support our shared goal to create a lasting community impact in the West Midlands, by supporting people to be active beyond our Games.\nNot-for-profit community-based organisations, such as local voluntary groups, schools, sports clubs, Community Interest Companies (CICs) and social enterprises that deliver community-based projects, that seek to tackle inactivity and promote the physical and mental benefits of leading an active life, are encouraged to apply.\nA full catalogue of the equipment for the community giveaway will be made available on Sport England website for groups and clubs to look at and apply for.\nIn addition, some of the high-performance equipment from our Games – such as temporary performance sprung flooring that created the netball and 3x3 basketball courts, as well as the boxing ring and high-performance Judo mats - is being distributed amongst national sports bodies.\nThis means that, alongside the separate community giveaway, these sports bodies will be able to repurpose some of their high-performance equipment into communities that can benefit the most from it.\nCommunity groups and schools have until 19 September to get their application in and can apply through the Sport England website.\nLooking for your next role?\nFancy working in Parliament?

The Harborne park has been nominated as one of 364 parks and green spaces in the running to be awarded UK’s Favourite Park 2022. The award celebrates the contributions green spaces deliver for our neighbourhoods and communities.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said: “Edgbaston constituency is blessed with so much green space of all descriptions, from the abundance of green, open space in Bartley Green to the more formal style of the Botanical Gardens in Edgbaston. It is fantastic to see Harborne’s Grove Park selected for this national award which, has been a sanctuary for so many during the pandemic. I now hope everyone in Harborne and across the constituency will really get behind the park and offer their support to see Grove Park awarded the UK’s Favourite Park.”\nHelen Griffiths, Chief Executive at Fields in Trust, said: “It is vital that we celebrate our nation’s parks to help ensure they are protected for future generations. Our children and grandchildren deserve to have the same access to green space that we do. This is a significant moment to change the way we think about the contribution local green spaces make to our health, our wellbeing, our environment, and ultimately our futures.”\nVoting is now open at www.fieldsintrust.org/favourite-parks and will close at noon on Thursday 18th August 2022. The parks with the most votes in each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be named National Favourites and the overall winner the UK's Favourite Park 2022.\n-ENDS-\nNotes to Editors\nFields in Trust is an independent UK wide charity with nearly 100 years’ experience of championing and supporting our parks and green spaces by protecting them for people to enjoy in perpetuity. Because once lost, they are lost forever. Fields in Trust works with landowners, community groups and policymakers to champion the value of our parks and green spaces to achieve better protection for their future at both the local and national level.\nThe UK’s Favourite Parks Award is a two-phase award. Firstly, any publicly accessible local green space was eligible to be nominated. All eligible nominations have progressed to a public vote. At close of voting the parks with the most votes in each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be named National Favourites and the overall winner the UK's Favourite Park 2022.

The days of tinkering around the edges of a system that has so clearly failed the public are over. This cannot go on, things must change. And Labour in government will make sure they will.\nWe will put the public back in control of the essential public transport they depend upon. We will give those communities that want it the power to set bus routes and fares, following the path set by our brilliant Mayors in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and in the Liverpool City Region.\nYet, in the West Midlands, it’s clear we’re being left behind by a Mayor who, like his failing Conservative government, talks a good game about bringing in investment and levelling up our region, but where is the delivery?\nIt is simply not acceptable that residents are now faced with a collapsing service of such a basic and fundamental part of our transport infrastructure. Birmingham and the West Midlands deserves a transport system that is fit for purpose. What’s the point in having a Conservative Mayor if he isn’t going to engage with his own Government and stand up for our region?\nBuses are an essential part of people's lives whether that's travelling to work, school or other activities. I've written to Diamond Buses to ask what actions they've taken before simply choosing to cut the 002 service that will have a serious impact on my constituents, in particular in Bartley Green where so many rely on this service.\nI will continue to stand with residents to fight for a reliable public transport service.\nRead my letter here:",

Like cigarettes, these products contain nicotine, making them addictive and harmful for our children’s health.\nOn the Conservatives’ watch, the number of habitual young vape users has trebled in just three years, with nearly 140,000 more children now vaping regularly. That’s hundreds of thousands of children now becoming addicted to nicotine.\nIn response to a written question I submitted, the Government revealed that 50 per cent of UK councils had reported that cigarettes or tobacco products were sold to under-18s. Similarly, staggering figures from this year show that over a quarter of vape test purchases carried out with retailers resulted in an illegal sale.\nWhat’s more, under current rules, retailers are unbelievably selling “nicotine-free” vapes to under-18s and dish out free samples to consumers regardless of their age. Yet, despite being branded as having “0 per cent nicotine”, research by Inter Scientific has revealed that a shocking 35 per cent of vapes claiming to be nicotine-free actually contained nicotine.\nFor years, the Labour Party has been calling for tougher measures to crack down on this epidemic in children taking up vaping. Two years ago, the party put forward an amendment to ban vapes being branded and advertised to children, which was voted down by the government. We now have an opportunity to address this in the Tobacco and Vapes Bill.\nResearch conducted by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute estimates that a third of all vapes sold may be non-compliant. Many of these non-compliant vapes contain nicotine strengths way over the legal limit, or substances that are known to be harmful when ingested, such as nickel and lead. As a result, the rife sale of illegal vapes poses a unique threat to public health.\nThe regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), is currently restricted in its powers to tackle the blooming market of illegal vapes. The MHRA is not legally able to prevent or remove notifications for products that didn’t meet the standards.\nElf Bar, which produces the most popular vapes on the UK market, was found to be selling products which had larger tank sizes than allowed. Unbelievably, the MHRA doesn’t have the powers to take this product off the market – Elf Bar had to voluntarily withdraw them.\nLabour supports a ban on disposable vapes because they overwhelmingly appeal to children – 69% of vapers aged 11-17 use disposable vapes. They also create a lot of litter and are terrible for the environment.\nHowever, in the draft regulation published by the government, the importation of illegal vapes is not currently prohibited and will not be under regulations as drafted by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). This is a serious omission by this government that needs addressing.\nThe next Labour government would come down like a ton of bricks on companies profiting at the expense of our children’s health and make sure the vaping industry cannot market to kids.",

I also spoke in the Parliamentary debate.\nWe need to break the business model of these vile criminals, so I commend the government for taking a practical approach to border security. This bill will create new powers to strengthen law enforcement’s ability to identify, disrupt and prevent serious and organised crime, including organised immigration crime, through new criminal offences and expanded data-sharing capabilities. These measures are similar to the approach taken to counter terrorism, enabling earlier intervention against those individuals facilitating organised crime.\nI’m also very pleased that the Government backed my bill and included measures that will criminalise the possession of the blueprints for 3D-printed guns. These guns are incredibly dangerous and are untraceable.\nI also spoke to the BBC about the threat posed by 3D-printed guns. You can read the write up here and watch the clip below.\nYou can also watch the Channel 4 documentary I featured in here.\nApprenticeship Week\nThis week is National Apprenticeship Week.\nApprenticeships are vital to grow our economy, and in Birmingham, we have 9,460 apprentices currently on their course. I’m glad that this Labour government has announced that up to 10,000 more apprentices will be able to qualify per year by giving employers more flexibility over maths and English requirements.\nThis comes along with other measures to create more opportunities for young people and grow the economy. Labour’s first piece of education legislation since entering government, currently going through Parliament, paves the way for Skills England – a body that will find and fill skills gaps across our country.\nThe Prime Minister has also announced new foundation apprenticeships, rebalancing our training system back towards young people.\nIf you have evidence about the challenges facing the further education system or knowledge of any solutions across the country, the Education Select Committee is calling for evidence for their new inquiry on Further Education and Skills. You can find out more and submit evidence to the inquiry before 7th March, here.\nTemporary Accommodation\nIn Birmingham, we have an unacceptable number of families and children in temporary accommodation. It’s not right that families are spending months or even years living out of hotel rooms or B&Bs due to a shortage of social and affordable housing.\nI’m pleased that our Labour government is investing £350m to increase the number of affordable and social homes and ease council housing pressures. You can read more here.\nNew Towns\nFor too long, the dream of homeownership has been denied to families in this country.\nHundreds of thousands of people are now set to benefit from a generation of new towns across Britain, with the Prime Minister paving the way for the largest housebuilding programme since the post-war era. These new towns will be well-designed, beautiful communities with affordable housing, GP surgeries, schools and public transport where people will want to live.\nOver 100 proposals from across every region in England have been submitted, and every new town will have the potential to deliver 10,000 new homes or more. Read more here.\nLeasehold\nMany of my constituents with leaseholds have been let down by unreliable managing agents like FirstPort.\nLabour is improving the lives of leasehold homeowners. We are introducing legislation that will allow them to easily and cheaply take control of the buildings they live in and clamp down on unreasonable or extortionate charges by giving more people access to the “Right to Manage” scheme. You can read more here.\nPublic Health Funding Boost\nAs a former cabinet minister for public health at Sandwell Council, I’m delighted that Birmingham has been given a 3% public health funding boost to drive key services, including children's health, addiction recovery, smoking cessation, and sexual health.\nThis increase in funding is part of a nearly £200 million boost for local authorities to improve health outcomes across the country and build healthier communities. You can read more here.\nWaiting Lists\nIt’s great news that the number of patients on NHS waiting lists has now fallen for the fourth month in a row.\nAt University Hospitals Birmingham Trust, in my constituency, waiting lists fell at twice the rate of the rest of the country over the same period. It’s clear that Labour’s plan for change is working. You can read more here.\nPMQs\nAsking the Prime Minister a question in PMQs this week\nAt PMQs, I asked the Prime Minister if he agreed with me that only Labour is serious about repairing our broken immigration system.\nOn Monday, MPs had the chance to support legislation put forward by this Labour government to crack down on criminal smuggler gangs and secure our borders. The Conservatives and Reform, however, linked arms in the voting lobby to vote against it. The Prime Minister agreed with me, saying \"they voted for open borders”.\nGrowth\nOn Thursday, I joined the Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds at an event with business CEOs as he set out his ambition for delivering further and faster growth.\nHe said he is serious about delivering our wider regulatory reform over the coming weeks and months, and is serious about building the pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-wealth creation economy that Labour promised at the General Election. You can read Jonathan Reynold’s full speech here.\nI also spoke to ITV about how Labour's plans will deliver growth in the West Midlands. You can read that article here.\nITV Central\nSpeaking to ITV Central about pride in Birmingham\nEarlier this week, I was shocked to see that a journalist had written up a piece in The Times bashing Birmingham.\nBirmingham is where I was born and raised. Tennis was invented on a lawn in Edgbaston in 1859. We have more canals than Venice, and the first ever hole-in-the heart surgery was carried out here.\nBirmingham has immense potential and is home to various growth sectors such as in research and development and life sciences.\nI won't accept anyone trashing our great city. I spoke to ITV Central about how proud I am to be a Brummie.\nLocal News\nSchool visit\nAt a Q&A session with students from KES\nIt was lovely to attend a Question Time event with King Edwards High School today.\nI always enjoy discussing politics and current affairs with young people. It was great to cover a variety of topics, including foreign policy, education, the NHS, housing, immigration and local issues.\nMalcolm X Visit to Smethwick\nThis week marked the 60th anniversary of Malcom X’s visit to Smethwick, to show solidarity for black and Asian minority communities facing significant racism. This is the ward where I was elected as a councillor.\nYou can read more about his visit and the historical political landscape in this article from the Guardian, which features my late father, here.\nWest Midlands Business Festival\nThe West Midlands' biggest Business Festival has arrived. In less than a month, there will be more than 80 free events across 2 weeks, starting Monday, 3rd March 2025. You can find out more and book your place here.\nQuinton Mast\nI’m pleased that the council has refused the application for a 20m high telecommunications mast at the island junction with Dwellings Lane and Quinton Road West.\nI objected to this mast, due to its proximity to Four Dwellings Academy, the lack of consultation and late notification. You can read my full letter below.\nEdgbaston Stadium\nAt Edgbaston cricket stadium\nIt's great that the redevelopment of Edgbaston stadium, which I have been supporting, has been approved by the council.\nThe Priory and Raglan stands at Edgbaston will be replaced with a new 3,191-seat facility. A 146-bed hotel will also be opened on the site.\nThe stadium in my constituency is world-renowned. Supporting it to grow will bring more visitors, investment and jobs now and in the future. Read more here.\nMHWC\nNext Tuesday, 18th February, the MHWC will be visiting Westbury Road in North Edgbaston, B17 8JH. The centre will be open between 07:30 and 13:00, so please do come along if you have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nQuinton PACT Meeting\nOn Friday 21st February, the Quinton neighbourhood police and community (PACT) meeting will take place between 6.30pm and 8pm at St Faith & St Laurence Church, B17 8RD. Please do come along if you have issued that you would like to raise with the police.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

I know this is an important issue to many in our constituency. Indeed, only last week a constituent got in touch to explain their service charge had increased over 200% over the last nine years, to increasingly unaffordable amounts. As the Prime Minister abandoned leasehold reform, only Labour can be trusted to tackle this issue.\nAlso, this week, we learned that water bills are going to rise to pay for the cost of stopping the Conservatives sewage scandal. While the government sit on their hands, Labour has set out how it will tackle this crisis.\nLabour will clean up our water system by introducing a legally binding target to end 90% of sewage discharges by 2030, stronger sanctions and fines for bosses and companies who fail to do so. There will be a standing charge penalty for outlets that don’t have monitoring in place, and we will protect customers by capping bill increases. In the worst cases, water bosses will face prison sentences for the worst pollution incidents.\nOnly Labour can deliver the solutions our country needs!\nCentral Lobby\nThis week, I joined ITV’s Alison Mackenzie to debate the fallout of May's local elections, the report into the running of Birmingham City Council and is the Government levelling up fast enough?\nThe local elections were a great night for Labour and a testament to how Keir Starmer has turned our party around. We are now the largest party in local government and Labour councillors are delivering for constituents in Birmingham and across the country.\nAs I explained to Alison, “the places that we are winning, are the places that we need to win if we want to win at the next General Election…. people are returning back to Labour!”\nWatch and listen to me discuss the local elections and more in the full clip below.\nSpeaking at Newman University\nOn Monday, I visited Newman University in Bartley Green where I spoke about my political journey into politics, followed by a Q&A session with the students. I wish to again extend my thanks to Dr Emma Folwell from Applied Humanities for inviting me to speak.\nGrowing up, my inspiration to get into politics was my late father. My dad came to Birmingham in the 1950s, where he worked in the Foundry and as a bus driver before becoming the President of the first Gurdwara in Smethwick. I saw how my father unionised the ethnic minority workers at his factory, to stop them having their pay packets stolen by other workers, and I recall being 14 years old and helping people with social security forms and interpreting for them.\nAfter thirteen years of Conservative Government, where they have crashed our economy and decimated public services, our task is the same as it was all those years ago – to rebuild our country in the interests of working people and to show the country that politics is once again a force for good.\nOnly Labour can be trusted to restore our economy, make our country a green energy superpower, build an NHS fit for the future, make our streets safe, and break down barriers to opportunity at every stage!\nSt Peter’s visit Parliament\nIn Parliament on Tuesday, it was fantastic to meet students from St Peter’s Catholic Primary School during their tour of the UK Parliament. It is so important for young people to understand the link between where they live and the day-to-day work of the UK Parliament.\nI wish to thank The Parliamentary Education and Engagement Team who work exceptionally hard throughout the year to deliver award-winning political engagement to primary, secondary, and post-16 providers. This includes organising tours, delivering workshops, assemblies, and other interactive sessions.\nI also want to thank St Peter’s for their fantastic questions during our Q&A session. I hope they left Parliament with a lot of new knowledge about the workings of Parliament and what Members of Parliament do.\nI strongly encourage other schools and colleges in our constituency to engage with the outreach team in Parliament. Click the button below for more information.\nMy letter to the Home Secretary\nOn Tuesday, I wrote to the Home Secretary about how the government is tackling child sexual exploitation, modern slavery and trafficking on pornographic content platforms like OnlyFans.\nAn Edgbaston resident contacted me after their own research identified criminality associated with some online platforms providing subscription models for online pornography.\nI looked further into this and found that these concerns are well-documented by organisations like The Avery Centre, the BBC, and The Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative.\nWhile these websites like these have policies in place, criminals are finding ways around them. Read my letter in full below.\nGP Pressures\nOn Friday, I wrote to the Health Secretary after GPs in Edgbaston contacted me to describe the pressure they and their colleagues are facing.\nThirteen years of Conservative failure has broken the system with successive Conservative administrations leaving patients struggling to access healthcare like GP appointments.\nWhile GPs are working flat out amid surging demand, a recent report by The Royal College of General Practitioners shows that 90% of general practice staff were concerned or very concerned about their practice's ability to deliver the level of care that patients needed this winter.\nI therefore wrote to Steve Barclay on behalf of GPs and patients in Edgbaston to ask what steps his government is taking to address these pressures.\nRead my letter in full below.\nLocal News\nThis week, George Dixon Primary received a Breakfast Club Hero award on behalf of the Kellog’s Breakfast Club Awards 2023. I wish to thank to all the staff at the school involved in delivering breakfast clubs for students and I extend congratulations to everyone at George Dixon on this fantastic achievement.\nWest Midlands Police have announced a new non-degree police entry route, allowing people to become a student officer with West Midlands Police, without the need for university study.

A growing economy and public services fit for the future need a modern transport system to support the flow of people and goods across the country.\nUnder the Conservatives Britain’s broken rail network is simply not delivering: cancellations have soared to record high levels, fares have risen almost twice as fast as wages since 2010, and strikes are costing taxpayers £25m for every day they go ahead, whilst taxpayers fork out huge subsidies to pay for trains that are overcrowded, delayed or cancelled.\nLabour will fold existing private passenger rail contracts into Great British Railways as they expire, without the taxpayer paying a penny in compensation costs, as part of a publicly owned and passenger focused railway.\nLabour’s plans mean an end to the misery Avanti West Coast passengers across the West Midlands face on a weekly basis.\nSince 2016 Avanti West Coast passengers have faced a huge 506% increase in cancelled services since 2016,[i] and only 37.2% of Avanti of trains were on time in October-December last year. [ii]\nThis compares to a shocking 61% increase in cancellations across Britain since 2016, with only 62% of services on time in October-December last year.\nDuring its first term, a Labour Government would:\nPut the passenger first, by delivering a best-price ticket guarantee for passengers, and rolling out automatic delay repay and digital season tickets across the network\nEstablish a powerful new passenger watchdog, the Passenger Standards Authority, to hold Great British Railways to account for passengers\nDeliver significant savings to the taxpayer by eliminating fragmentation, waste, bureaucracy and by stopping profits leaking out to private operators\nCreate a unified, publicly owned, accountable and arm’s length Great British Railways, which will be led by rail experts, not Whitehall\nExpect to complete the transition to public ownership within the first term of a Labour Government, by folding existing private passenger rail contracts into the new body as they expire, without the taxpayer paying a penny in compensation costs\nGive devolved leaders, including Mayoral Combined Authorities, a statutory role in the rail network, allowing decisions about the railways to be taken closer to the communities they serve\nSupport successful open access and freight operators to continue to deliver, and set clear objectives and targets for passenger services and freight growth\nLabour’s plans mean delivering a unified, publicly owned rail within the first term of a Labour Government, as franchises are brought in house as contracts expire, meaning taxpayers won’t pay a penny in compensation costs.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said:\n“For too long my constituents have been let down by unreliable and inefficient train services, holding back our economy and stopping people accessing opportunities.\n“That’s I am supporting Labour’s plans to create Great British Railways - a new, publicly owned and expert-led body to run our railways and put the passenger first.\n“Labour’s plans will mean reliable, safe, efficient, accessible, affordable and quality train services, no matter where you live.”\nLouise Haigh, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Transport said:\n“Labour will deliver the biggest overhaul in our railways for a generation, ending the deepening crisis and chaos that passengers have been forced to endure in recent years.\n“Underinvestment, fragmentation, inefficiency, waste and 14 years of tinkering by Conservative Ministers have left our railways unfit to meet the demands of modern Britain.\n“Under Labour, a publicly owned and controlled railway will focus on what matters to passengers.”\nEnds\nNotes\nFull policy document, ‘Getting Britain Moving: Labour’s Plan to Fix Britain’s Railways’ is available here: labour.org.uk/get-britain-moving\nEnding Misery for Passengers\nFor years passengers across the West Midlands have faced misery due to cancelled and delayed services from Avanti West Coast.\nBetween 2016 and 2023 cancelled Avanti services have soared by a shocking 506%, as today’s broken rail system has let down passengers across the West Midlands.[iii]\nAnd the punctuality of Avanti services has failed to improve, with only 37.2% of services on time between October-December last year.[iv]\nLabour’s plans for a publicly owned and passenger focused railway would put an end to this misery.\nWe expect to complete the transition to public ownership within the first term of a Labour Government, by folding existing private passenger rail contracts into the new body as they expire, without the taxpayer paying a penny in compensation.\nThe State of Britain’s Broken Railways\nBritain’s broken railways are not delivering for passengers or for taxpayers.\nCancellations have soared to record high levels,[v] constant delays are damaging faith in the rail network,[vi] fares have risen almost twice as fast as wages since 2010,[vii] and strikes are costing taxpayers £25m for every day they go ahead.[viii]\nProgress has been held back by the complex mess of today’s rail network. For instance, hundreds of people are employed full-time to argue over whose fault delays ar Group https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/about-us/publications/12839-2021-04-assessing-the-value-of-rail-freight/ e;[ix] passengers have to navigate 55 million different ticket options;[x] and 75 different types of train are in passenger service on today’s network.[xi]\nYet nothing is being done to address the chaos on Britain’s railways, as the Tories refuse to bring forward long-delayed rail reforms ahead of the general election.[xii]\nLabour will deliver a Railways Act for England, Scotland, and Wales to establish Great British Railways and enable the full benefits of a unified railway.\nDelivering Improvements for Passengers\nLabour will have six key objectives for rail reforms: Delivering rail services that are reliable, affordable, efficient, quality, accessible, and safe.\nLabour will merge functions and resources from existing bodies to establish a powerful new passenger watchdog – the Passenger Standards Authority – to independently monitor standards and champion improvement in service performance against a range of measures.\nLabour’s plans will deliver clear improvements for passengers including:\nAutomatic delay and cancellation refunds\nIncreased integration of timetables, ticketing, and fares\nAn ambition to introduce a best-price guarantee, like Transport for London offers which ensures you automatically pay the lowest possible amount for tickets when making contactless payments\nDigital season tickets\nClear standards that need to be met by all services\nBetter mobile connectivity, including moving towards 5G\nBetter integration with other modes, such as buses and cycle hire\nDriving Down Costs for Taxpayers\nLabour’s plans to fold existing private passenger rail contracts into Great British Railways as they expire mean taxpayers will not have to pay a penny in compensation costs to outgoing private operators.\nLabour’s plans will reduce waste, drive up standards for passengers and bring down costs for taxpayers.\nThe Government’s analysis in the Williams Review estimated that the savings generated by ending inefficiency and fragmentation on the railways is equivalent to £1.5 billion a year after an initial five-year implementation period.[xiii]\nLabour’s plans will go further, and internal analysis suggests significant additional savings could be achieved through public ownership. This includes savings from franchise bidding costs, less duplication of resources and less friction between operators.\nEmpowering Local Leaders\nUnder Labour, national and regional governments and mayors will be empowered to integrate local railways with other transport modes, delivering London-style integrated transport networks across the country.\nDevolved leaders in Scotland, Wales, and in Mayoral Combined Authorities will have a statutory role in the rail network. National and regional transport bodies will have the ability to agree national and regional rail services with Great British Railways.\nOpen Access Operators\nLabour’s plans to fix Britain’s railways are pragmatic. The current model of passenger rail services has clearly failed passengers and taxpayers, but there will still be a role for the private sector on Britain’s railways under Labour where it is proven to deliver.\nOpen access operators, like Hull Trains and Lumo, will be able to continue to compete to improve the offer to passengers wherever there is a case that open access adds value and capacity to the network.\nSupporting Rail Freight\nLabour will seize on the huge economic potential of rail freight. Rail freight already contributes an estimated £2.45 billion to the UK economy,[xiv] and a single freight train can carry as much as 129 lorries[xv] – reducing the traffic clogging up our roads and bringing down carbon emissions.\nRail freight will remain within the private sector, but Labour will introduce a statutory duty on Great British Railways to promote the use of rail freight, and targets for growing the use of rail freight will be set by the Secretary of State for Transport.\nSources\n[i] Office of Rail and Road cancellation data (accessed April 2024): https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/2177/table-3123-trains-planned-and-cancellations-by-operator-and-cause.ods\n[ii] Office of Rail and Road punctuality data (accessed April 2024): https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/statistics/performance/passenger-rail-performance/\n[iii][iii] Office of Rail and Road cancellation data (accessed April 2024): https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/2177/table-3123-trains-planned-and-cancellations-by-operator-and-cause.ods\n[iv] Office of Rail and Road punctuality data (accessed April 2024): https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/statistics/performance/passenger-rail-performance/\n[xiii] Gov.uk, ‘Great British Railways: The Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail’ (May 2021), p8: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60cb29dde90e0743ae8c29c1/gbr-williams-shapps-plan-for-rail.pdf Quoting efficiencies based on internal unpublished DfT analysis; Table 7223 – Franchised passenger train operator finances by franchise, ORR: https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/statistics/finance/rail-industry-finance/table-7223-franchised-passenger-train-operator-finances-by-franchise-latest-year/\n[xiv] Deloitte (2021) “Assessing the Value of Rail Freight”, a report for the Rail Delivery Group https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/about-us/publications/12839-2021-04-assessing-the-value-of-rail-freight/\n[xv] Deloitte (2021) “Assessing the Value of Rail Freight”, a report for the Rail Delivery",

This comes in the form of up to £8.6 million to repair roads and fix potholes in the West Midlands, as part of a record national £1.6 billion investment to repair road networks in England.\nThe landmark investment – an increase of nearly 50% on local road maintenance funding from last year – goes well beyond the Government’s manifesto pledge and is enough to fix the equivalent of over seven million extra potholes nationally in 2025/26.\nAcross England, local highways authorities will receive a 40% uplift in funding on average as the Government looks to rebuild Britain as part of its Plan for Change. Fixing our roads and filling potholes not only makes roads safer, but they also improve journey times and save drivers money from avoidable repairs.\nIt comes as figures from the RAC show for drivers in the West Midlands the cost of pothole damage to vehicles is around £500 on average a year, with more severe repairs costing considerably more. According to the AA, fixing potholes is a priority for 96 per cent of drivers.\nThe public is also being encouraged to report potholes in through a dedicated Gov.uk page: https://www.gov.uk/report-pothole.\nLabour’s approach is in stark contrast to the Tories’. Under the last Government, damage to cars cost drivers almost £500m and car insurance went up by more than £200 on average in just two years.\nTo further protect motorists given continued cost-of-living pressures and potential fuel price volatility amid global uncertainty, Labour froze fuel duty at current levels for another year at the last budget, saving the average car driver £59.\nThis Labour Government is delivering its Plan for Change with investment and reform to deliver growth, improving living standards in the West Midlands and across the country by putting more money in people’s pockets and rebuilding Britain.\nPreet Kaur Gill, Member of Parliament for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“On National Pothole Day, I am delighted that this Labour Government is doing things differently and taking swift action to fix our roads. Drivers have been plagued by potholes for too long, after 14 long years of Tory neglect. Under the Conservatives the situation spiralled out of control, with pothole damage costing drivers almost £500 million.”\n”The impact of this funding will be transformative, with journeys in Birmingham made safer, quicker and cheaper for drivers. This announcement goes well beyond the promises we made in our manifesto at the last election and shows that we’re serious about our Plan for Change, which will focus on investment and growth to put more money in people’s pockets and rebuilding Britain.”\nTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander said:\n“Potholes have plagued motorists for far too long, but this record investment will start to reverse a decade of decline on our country’s roads. “Too many drivers have to endure an obstacle course when on the roads – whether that’s to go to work, pick up children from school, or see friends. Potholes damage cars and make pedestrians and cyclists less safe. We are investing £1.6bn to fix up to seven million more potholes next year.\n“This government is firmly on the side of drivers. Every area of England will get extra cash to tackle this problem once and for all. We have gone beyond our manifesto commitment to back motorists and help raise living standards in every part of the country.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\n• National Pothole Day takes place on the 15th January\n• The breakdown for funding across England is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/highways-maintenance-fundingallocations/highways-maintenance-block-formula-allocations-2025-to-2026",

Sunak’s failure to negotiate with striking workers and stop industrial action has only made a terrible situation worse, leaving even more patients stuck waiting for treatment on waiting lists, unable to live their lives to the full.\nThe number of people waiting for treatment across England has increased every single month since Rishi Sunak pledged to cut NHS waiting lists.\nData published last month revealed that 137,896 people are waiting for treatment at University Hospitals Birmingham Trust (UHB). Of those waiting, a total of 12,789 have been waiting longer than a year.\nOnly Labour can be trusted to fix the crisis in the NHS and build a health service fit for the future.\nWe have a plan to cut waiting lists by getting the NHS working around the clock, delivering 2 million extra appointments a year, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status.\nThe Metro\nThis week, I continued to show my support for The Metro and Feed’s Formula for Change campaign.\nThe restrictions that prevent families from using store points and gift cards to buy infant formula are clearly outdated no longer fit for purpose.\nThat’s why Labour will urgently review the existing legislation to ensure that retailers will be able to accept loyalty cards as payment for infant formula.\nRead the full article here:\nIn Parliament\nThis week in Parliament, I spoke in a Westminster Hall debate on the future of the NHS.\nAfter 13 years of Tory incompetence, 1 in 7 of us are stuck on waiting lists and public satisfaction in the NHS is at a 40-year low. 26 million people of working age are out of work long-term sick – a record high.\nWe’re also facing a crisis in dentistry, with patients across the country pulling their own teeth out because they cannot get the care they need.\nLabour will get the NHS back on its feet. We will train thousands more doctors and nurses, so the NHS has the staff it needs, armed with cutting edge technology to treat patients sooner and faster. We will get doctors and nurses working around the clock to bust the backlogs and pull the NHS out of perma-crisis.\nWe will also rescue NHS dentistry by providing 700,000 more urgent appointments a year to bring down backlogs, and targeted funding to train up dentists in left behind areas.\nLiver Cancer\nThis week, it was a privilege to speak at the British Liver Trust’s report launch on Liver Cancer.\nLiver cancer has one of the poorest survival rates of all types of cancer, with a five-year survival rate of just 13%. It is also now the fastest rising cause of cancer death in the UK.\nWith liver cancer, early diagnosis saves lives. 80-90% of liver cancer patients have underlying cirrhosis, and 90% of liver disease is preventable. That's why the next Labour government will have a relentless focus on prevention and improving earlier detection of diseases.\nLocal News\nSpeed Limit Consultation\nThis week, I responded to Birmingham City Council’s consultation around reviewing all existing 40mph speed limits across the city, with the intention that they become 30mph. Included in the proposed scheme are Wolverhampton Road South, West Boulevard, Barnes Hill, Shenley Lane, and Hagley Road West.\nI told the council that I support the speed reduction initiative, citing the 50+ cases I have worked on this year after constituents raised concerns about speeding, illegal car racing, and cruising on roads in and around Edgbaston.\nI also requested that 30mph limit reduction be extended all the way up to the Quinton Island/Quinton Expressway roundabout and introduced in Genners Lane, Cromwell Lane, Moors Lane, Gillhurst Road, Croftdown Road, Augustus Road, Woodbourne Road, Norfolk Road, Westfield Road, and Quinton Road West.\nThe consultation closes on 19 November and I encourage you to have your say, which you can give online here:\nYou can also read my full submission to the consultation here:\nWest Midlands Police\nWest Midlands Police has recognised the far-reaching impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict and have accordingly increased patrols across parts of the region to provide a visible presence and reassurance to our communities.\nWith more protests coming up over the coming days, they have promised to ensure that an appropriate policing plan is in place in order to balance the right to protest against any disruption to communities.\nMHRC\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Trimpley Road, B32 3PE, in Bartley Green, and Green Lane, B321EP, in Quinton, on 30thOctober.The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so please come along if you're local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

During the campaign the Party pledged to ‘get knives off our streets’. The Bill introduced this week will give the police new powers to seize, retain and destroy knives held in private, applicable when the police believe the knife will be used in a violent crime.\nLabour’s bill comes as statistics show that in the West Midlands Police Force Area, knife crime rose by 118.63% under the Tories.\nIt also includes strong new rules to prevent online knife sales, including personal liability for senior managers of online platforms who fail to act on illegal content including knives and offensive weapons.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper will also introduce a new offence of possession of an offensive weapon with intent to cause harm. It also increases the maximum penalty for offences relating to the sale of offensive weapons.\nThe Bill will also strengthen age verification requirements for online sale of bladed products. The law will be named after 16-year old Ronan Kanda, stabbed to death in Wolverhampton by a boy who had used his mother’s ID to purchase a 22-inch sword online.\nMaking Britain’s streets safe is a major plank of this Labour Government’s Plan for Change, and the Government has pledged to half knife crime in a decade.\nPreet Kaur Gill, Labour MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“I wholeheartedly welcome this tough new action to crack down on knife crime and protect communities like mine in Birmingham, Edgbaston. Too many children's lives are being lost, with families and communities left devastated as a result.\n“This government has set an ambitious mission for the country to halve knife crime over the next decade and we will pursue every possible avenue to save young lives. I wholeheartedly welcome this tough new action to crack down on knife crime and I will continue to campaign on this issue for communities like mine in Birmingham.”\n“This Government is committed to making Britain’s streets safe again, as part of Labour’s Plan for Change. I stand full square behind these efforts.”\nEnds\nNotes\n• Data for increases in knife crime: Number of knife and sharp instrument offences recorded by the police, for selected offences, by Police Force Area. https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/policeforceareadatatables, Tab P5",

Even the Foreign Secretary’s own policy advisor has admitted that the merger has hampered efforts to track projects and secure value for money.\nAs this Government tries to politicise development spending, the risk of waste and scandals like Pergau Dam will increase.

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_weekly-update-28-april/content_272.html": "My Weekly Update - 28 April\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Apr 28, 2023\n- 5 min read\nUpdated: May 5, 2023\nLatest figures show that the Tory Government still haven’t got Britain back on the right track as food and drink inflation rose from 18.2% in February to 19.2% in March, the highest rate in over 4 decades.\nWhile the Tories try to brush this off as a global problem, it is the UK who has the worst food inflation in the G7 – they have managed the economy into decline and left us all worse off. I am regularly contacted by constituents telling me how they are affected by soaring inflation.\nHere in Birmingham, members of the Food Foundation, including Dr Ewan Hamnett, a Harborne resident, highlights the true impact of the Conservatives’ cost of living crisis through a compelling short film titled 'They know we are here but they don't see us'. I hope it’s screening in Parliament on the 25th of April will have woken up the Government to the crisis they are failing to address. Please find the film linked below.\nIn contrast to the Tories, Labour understands the needs of those most affected and have an organised plan to get Britain out of this cost-of-living crisis. I believe that we need subsidies for British food manufacturers and small businesses to reduce the cost burden on struggling consumers, funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas giants making excessive profits as Britons are forced to choose between heating and eating.\nM5 Trees referred to the PHSO\nOn Monday, I supported residents affected by the removal of the trees along the M5 motorway in Quinton by submitting a complaint on their behalf to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, asking that they launch an investigation into the actions of Highways England.\nResidents have waited long enough in frustrating circumstances for answers and compensation. I have been to the houses which back on to the M5. I have been there when the trees were in place, and I have since they were cut down. You can’t miss the change in the noise level. It is now overwhelming. I also worry about what impact this is having on local air pollution.\nIn my letter to the Ombudsman, I have called for:\nImmediate air quality monitoring to be installed on effected roads\nThe installation of an acoustic barrier to replace the natural barrier that was provided by the trees\nAn apology to all residents which have been impacted by the removal of trees\nFinancial compensation for the impact these actions have had on residents.\nI will continue to work with and update residents as things move forward.\nEdgbaston Sikh Roundtable\nOn Thursday, I had the privilege of attending a Vaisakhi Roundtable at Edgbaston Cricket Ground to discuss community cricket, professional pathway cricket, and use and access of the stadium. This Roundtable follows Sunday’s event where Edgbaston hosted its first Vaisakhi Cricket Cup, which was similarly joyous to attend.\nEdgbaston Cricket Ground is a jewel in our constituency, hosting global events like the Commonwealth Games in 2022, and driving forward the legacy of the Games by seeking to expand access to the grounds to engage all communities in sport.\nSport is far more than just exercise – it is something that give us identity, belonging, shared experiences, joy and brings our communities together. It is also something that, after two years of lockdown, there is a real zest for as people seek to regain their love of the outdoors and embed themselves within their community through sport.\nStadia like Edgbaston should be bringing people together and be a focal point of communities and I look forward to working closely with Edgbaston to this end. Click below for a roundup video of Edgbaston’s first Vaisakhi event.\nOur Lady of Fatima School Visit\nThis week, I was delighted to visit Our Lady of Fatima Primary School to meet with the school Council, Governor, and Vice Principal, Mr Leese.\nIt is always a delight to visit schools in our constituency to listen to what is on the minds of young people and the concerns they have. Young people often do not get enough credit for how much they absorb of what goes on in the world around them.\nThe students at Our Lady of Fatima raised fantastic questions and are concerned about funding for school equipment. While schools should not need to fundraise – a sorry indictment of thirteen years of Conservative Government – I commend the students for their enthusiasm to improve the resources at the school for fellow and future students. I will support them in any way I can.\nIt’s certainly important that MPs take the time to listen to young people of all ages and reflect on what they say. Their voice matters.\nI look forward to visits at more schools in our constituency and I wish all our young people well for the final few months of this academic term.\nImportant votes in Parliament this week\nOn Tuesday, Labour held a Debate to End the Tory Sewage Scandal.\nIn our own constituency, analysis of Environment Agency data shows that in 2022, raw sewage was dis charged into Edgbaston’s water for 213 hours, the equivalent of there being a continuous flow of sewage taking place for a staggering 9 consecutive days. I know residents will be as horrified as I am about this. That is why I voted on Tuesday to End the Tory Sewage Scandal.\nThe next Labour government will build a better Britain and end the Tory sewage scandal by delivering mandatory monitoring on all sewage outlets, introducing automatic fines for discharges, setting ambitious targets for stopping systematic sewage dumping and ensuring that water bosses are held to account for negligence.\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the Illegal Immigration Bill returned to Parliament.\nFor four years Tory Ministers have promised that their policies would end channel crossings and speed up the asylum system but instead they have repeatedly made things worse. They have announced gimmicks and chased headlines rather than doing the hard work needed to tackle the problem. This Bill is no different.\nI voted with Labour for a new cross-border police unit to tackle gangs, for a new deal with Europe on legal routes and returns, for Councils to be consulted on local asylum accommodation, for the removal and return of terror suspects, to fast-track asylum decisions, and for safe and legal routes for children with family in the UK. Tory MPs voted against all of this.\nOur country deserves an asylum system that is compassionate, fair, and consistent. Yet, the Conservatives have broken this system. Only Labour can be trusted to fix it.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

The controversial move has faced a lot of backlash, with complaints coming from the community, RMT union and Preet Kaur Gill as well as other senior Labour MPs.\nBoth Five Ways and University Station are key stations which rely on well-functioning services. University Station, one of the busiest in the city, is particularly important as it provides citizens with essential access to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Birmingham Women’s Hospital. Many people passing through University Station will be vulnerable, and many elderly and disabled. For those users, digital ticketing alternatives can present a challenge. Research by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), for instance, has found that only 3% of people with sight loss said they could use a ticket vending machine without problems and 58% said it was impossible.\nStudents at the University of Birmingham will also be affected by ticket office closures at University Station.\nCommenting on the proposed closure of ticket offices, Preet Kaur Gill said: “I am deeply concerned for my elderly and disabled constituents, the hundreds of thousands of people employed in our rail industry, the staff employed in my own constituency, and all those who rely on the support and advice provided by staff in ticket offices.\n\"Cutting staff and closing ticket offices at University Station and Five Ways will have a major impact on my constituents. Passengers have repeatedly complained about ticket offices being closed or not working at University Station and Five Ways. What they need are functioning ticket offices, not for them to be abandoned completely.\n“Many of these passengers relying on ticket offices are elderly and disabled rail users, to whom digital alternatives can present a challenge. And, as the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has highlighted, only 3% of people with sight loss said they could use a ticket vending machine without problems and 58% said it was impossible.\n“Passengers in my constituency are already suffering due to the chaos on our railways. They should not have to face any further disruptions to their travel plans due to rushed changes to our rail networks.\n“It is vital that staff have clarity about their job security and that vulnerable passengers have certainty that they will not be forgotten about as changes are made to the way our stations operate.”\nSee the letters Preet Kaur Gill wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport and West Midlands Trains below.",

Since then, the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners has been debated in both Houses in the UK on various occasions. Meanwhile, the Home Office published a report in November 2023 which details and recognises the state repression and persecution Falun Gong practitioners have experienced in China.\nOn behalf of constituents in Edgbaston who recently raised concerns with Preet about the treatment of the Falun Gong in China, Preet asked the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, whether he has had recent discussions with his counterparts in China on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners.\nIn response, the government said,\n'We remain deeply concerned about the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners and others on the grounds of their religion or belief in China. The environment for Freedom of Religion or Belief (FoRB) across China is restrictive, which includes the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.\nThe British government works with international organisations and networks to promote and protect the freedom of religion or belief for all where it is threatened, including through the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance.\nThe Foreign Secretary set out his concerns about human rights violations in China during his introductory call with China's Foreign Minister on 5 December 2023.'\nPreet affirms that we all must be able to practice our religion and our faith without fear of persecution.\nIf you live in Edgbaston and wish to raise a policy or casework query with Preet, then please contact Preet on preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk or telephone 0121 392 8426.",

The Prime Minister’s announcement represents the most ambitious yet honest blueprint for government in a generation and will allow the public to track our progress.\nOur Plan for Change consists of the following milestones:\nHigher Living Standards across the country, measured by Real Household Disposable Income per capita. So, working people have more money in their pocket as we deliver the fastest growth in the G7.\nRebuilding Britain, with 1.5 million homes over the Parliament and planning decisions made on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects.\nEnding hospital backlogs by meeting the NHS standard of 92% of patients waiting fewer than 18 weeks from referral to treatment.\nPolice back on the beat, with 13,000 more officers, PCSOs and special constables in neighbourhood roles and a named officer in every community through our Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee in England and Wales.\nA best start to life for children with a record proportion of five year-olds starting school ready to learn, allowing teachers to focus on the whole class. That means hitting the Early Years Foundation Standard at age 5/\nSecure, home-grown energy, with billpayers protected as we deliver Clean Power 2030.\nThese milestones are underpinned by our foundations of sound public finances and secure borders. We will reduce small boat crossings and net migration while restoring order to asylum and immigration systems by ending asylum hotel use and increasing returns. We will also meet our fiscal rules and strengthen national security.\nWhile this Plan for Change sets our course for the next Parliament, we have already made great strides in rebuilding Britain after 14 years of chaos and managed decline under the last government.\nUnder the Tories:\nNHS waiting lists skyrocketed to 188,000 across our area.\nPolice Community Support Officers were cut by 514 in West Midlands Police.\nThe number of children meeting key early years development targets sat at 66% in the West Midlands – a figure that Labour wants to hit 75% by the end of the parliament.\nSince July, we have given the NHS the biggest uplift in funding outside of Covid years since 2010 and have started a huge national conversation about the NHS to inform our 10 Year Plan for change and modernisation. We’ve kickstarted the rollout of our specialist neighbourhood police training programme and announced new Respect Orders to give police and councils the powers they need to crack down on repeated anti-social behaviour.\nTough decisions in the Budget stabilised the economy and prevented a return to austerity while protecting working people’s payslips, and we’ve already set out how we’re overhauling planning to get Britain building. The launch of Great British Energy will provide clean, secure and homegrown power. Families will soon be able to access free breakfast clubs at Primary School, and we’ve already set out funding for up to 300 new or expanded nurseries in state primary schools. 29,500 workers will benefit from an increase in the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage in Birmingham alone.\nWhen Labour won power, we inherited crumbling public services and an economy in dire straits. We have taken immediate action to steady the course, and are now setting clear goals to galvanise work across government and make people better off.\nLabour’s Plan for Change sends a clear signal that this government chooses stability, investment and reform over chaos, austerity and decline.\nMy 10 Minute Rule Bill\nThis week, Parliament passed my Bill to improve data collection on Jewish and Sikh people.\nThe Public Body Ethnicity Data Bill would provide that, where a public body collects data about ethnicity for the purpose of delivering public services, it must include specific “Sikh” and “Jewish” categories as options for a person’s ethnic group.\nDespite being legally recognised as ethnic groups for over 40 years, public bodies never or rarely collect data on Jewish and Sikh people to monitor inequalities and deliver public services. It makes our communities invisible to policymakers.\nFor example, it means that the full numbers of our community aren’t collected in the Census, Councils don’t include us in the data they use to monitor and deliver services, and bodies like the NHS don’t collect data to tackle health inequalities in our communities, like high rates of Covid deaths during the pandemic or the predisposition to certain genetic conditions like breast cancer in Ashkenazi women.\nIn presenting my Bill, I was delighted to have the support of a wide range of community organisations, including the Sikh Council UK, 112 Gurdwaras and UK Sikh organisations, The Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Antisemitism Policy Trust and the Community Security Trust (CST).\nIf you are Jewish or Sikh, I would love to hear from you if you have thoughts on my Bill. If you’d like to learn more, you can read coverage in the news at the links below.\nTackling VAWG\nEarlier this week, I was proud to join Women’s Aid in Parliament to join their 16 Days of Activism event.\nDomestic abuse is a national emergency. 3,000 crimes of violence against women and girls (VAWG) are recorded each day, with at least 1 in 12 women becoming victims each year. Given most victims do not report to the police, the true number is likely much higher.\nI am proud to support this Labour government's ambition to halve violence against women.\nFrom overhauling police vetting, to education, to legal advocates for rape survivors, we will work across the whole of society to make change.\nBreathe Easy campaign\nNHS Birmingham and Solihull has launched a campaign across the region, encouraging people to ‘breathe easy’ by getting their vital immunisations.\nOver 65s, those with a long term health condition and pregnant women are among the most at risk of getting flu, COVID and RSV if they don’t get vaccinated.\nOver 10,000 local people will be admitted to hospital this winter suffering with an avoidable respiratory illness, and over 750 people in Birmingham and Solihull could die this winter from avoidable respiratory illnesses including flu, COVID and RSV.\nProtect you and your loved ones by making sure to get immunised this winter.\nKidney Care\nIt was a pleasure to join Kidney Care UK this week, where I met my nephew who is supporting a young boy who is currently on dialysis. I am very proud of him for working with Kidney Care UK on their campaign.\nCurrently, there are over 7,500 people on the waiting list for organ donation across the UK at present. While there has been tremendous progress in organ donation in recent decades, there is still a shortage of donors. Sadly, every day across the UK, someone dies waiting for a transplant.\nI am therefore pleased to see the Government continuing to work with NHS Blood and Transplant and NHS England to improve utilisation of all solid organs following recommendations from the Organ Donation Group 2023 report. This includes considering how Assessment and Recovery Centres could be established and where deceased donor kidneys are perfused and assessed, with the potential to increase kidneys for transplantation by up to 400 per year.\nTech start-ups\nIt was fascinating as well to visit an event organised by ACT, the App Association, where I was able to meet with some of the UK's top tech start-ups. It was great to see some of the latest AI and Internet of Things developments being created right here in the UK.\nOne of the developers I met was working on wearable sensors that could use AI to support carers in predicting when someone is at risk of having a fall. It was exciting to consider the potential for this new technology to improve our public services and vulnerable people's quality of life.\nLocal News\nDudley Road\nToday it was great to visit businesses on Dudley Road.\nI've always been proud of the entrepreneurialism of my constituents, and I am proud that Birmingham created an average of 61 new businesses every day this year.\nHowever, I know our high streets need more support, so I met with businesses today to discuss what we can do to revitalise our high streets, with a three-year strategy to bring in more investment, clean up the area, and tackle issues like fly-tipping and parking.\nAhead of Small Business Saturday, I am encouraging my constituents to get out and support their local traders with their Christmas shop this year.\nQuinton Police Station\nThis week it was great to visit Quinton Police Station, to see it back in action after years of hard-fought campaigning with residents to save it from being shut down.\nIt was lovely to meet with our local inspector Paul Hatton, and it's great to have our local police back in the heart of our community in Quinton again. Across the constituency, we now have five officers in every ward, and I will be pushing for more.\nUnder the Tories, West Midlands Police lost 2,200 officers. Labour has pledged to put more police back on the beat, with 13,000 more officers, PCSOs and special constables in neighbourhood roles and a named officer in every community through our national Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee.\nMeeting with Chief Crown Prosecutor\nThis week I was also able to meet with the Chief Crown Prosecutor of the West Midlands, Siobhan Blake, to be briefed on the work the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) does to support our criminal justice system.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

I wrote to the Health Secretary last year about a Recovery and Respite Plan for Unpaid Carers, you can find my letter below.\nWhile successive Conservative Governments have delayed reform, the next Labour Government will deliver a 10-year plan of investment and reform. Labour will put social care on an equal footing with the NHS, improve access, and ensure every older and disabled person gets the right support when and where they need it.\nFor me, this means building towards a National Care Service, which is locally delivered but underpinned by high national standards. This must start with better pay, terms, and conditions for care workers to address recruitment and retention.\nI express my gratitude to all those carers across Edgbaston!\nAfghan Women and Girls\nThis week, I met inspiring Afghan women, and contributed to a Westminster Hall debate on the situation facing women and girls in Afghanistan.\nThis debate took place almost a year after I visited Afghanistan following the fall of Kabul to the Taliban the previous summer. At that time, Labour urged the Government to set out a comprehensive strategy for their engagement with Afghanistan. Sadly, UK policy since 2021 has remained piecemeal, uncoordinated, and inadequate to lift the Afghan people out of protracted crisis, nor has it had influence with respect to the wilful destruction of the basic rights and freedoms of Afghan women.\nWomen have been prevented from entering parks and gyms, among other public places, and women hold no Cabinet posts in the de facto Administration. Meanwhile, a January 2023 poll found that women could no longer access services from one in five of the 87 Afghan NGOs surveyed.\nThe women of Afghanistan had a very simple message for the United Kingdom when I met them last year: 'do not forget us'. Britain and its allies must stand with them. As Shadow Minister for International Development, I will not forget them.\nThe voice of Afghan women must be heard!\nBBC Local Radio\nFor me, the BBC is a great British institution and local radio is the cornerstone of it. Therefore, I am deeply concerned about changes the BBC is planning to make to large parts of its local radio output – after BBC England announced cuts to its funding for local radio programming in October last year.\nWhether it is local traffic updates, school closures or extreme weather events, the provision of trustworthy local news is vital, especially at a time when misinformation is becoming common but hard to spot in a digital world. Regular local programming also gives people access to the arts, charities, education, and cultural events that are truly relevant to them.\nI have therefore joined a cross-party group of West Midlands MPs to write to the BBC with our concerns. In the letter, we ask that the BBC reconsider its approach and ensure there is proper consultation about the impact of any proposed changes so that it can deliver the value to our constituents that we know it is capable of.\nPlease find my letter in full below.\nLocal News\nThe recently opened Bartley Green & Northfield Community Fridge are looking for volunteers. If you can spare some time to help out, please reach out to the organisers on BgnFridge@outlook.com. You can also find out more information online here.\nI recently learned from Calthorpe Estates that they have awarded their first ever bursary to a student from our constituency. I wish to put on record my thanks to Calthorpe for funding this bursary and to wish Arnand success in their continued studies!\nThe University of Birmingham is once again demonstrating itself as a leading UK university. On Tuesday, I learned the Department for Transport announced the university had won a Transport Research Innovation Grant, to support research into innovative transport ideas. Meanwhile, the university has also won a £10 million grant from Cancer Research UK to continue its world-class clinical trials. I pay tribute to all those at the university for their continued excellence.\nI hope you all have a fantastic weekend in the sun!\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_preet-kaur-gill-mp-welcomes-new-funding-for-gambling-harms-treatment/content_104.html": "Preet Kaur Gill MP welcomes new funding for gambling harms treatment\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Feb 3\n- 2 min read\nPreet Kaur Gill MP, Member of Parliament for Birmingham, Edgbaston, welcomes the Government’s introduction of a statutory levy on gambling operators, generating £100 million for the research, prevention, and treatment of gambling harms.\nGambling harms can have a devastating effect on people’s lives. 2.5% of the population are gambling in a severe and harmful way but many more are affected, whether that be family members or gamblers who are experiencing negative consequences but below the clinical threshold.\nUnder the current voluntary system, not all gambling companies contribute proportionately to research, prevention and treatment of gambling harms, with some operators paying as little as £1 a year. The new mandatory levy will ensure all operators contribute a fair share, and will be applied at proportionate levels depending on the sector and nature of the gambling activity.\nOf the new £100m in funding, treatment will be allocated 50% the levy and will be overseen by NHS who will commission a full treatment pathway, from referral and triage through to aftercare. Prevention will be allocated 30% to develop an early intervention approach, and research will get the remaining 20% of funding.\nThis funding comes as part of a wider package of measures, which includes the introduction of stake limits for online slots. Stake limits will be set at £5 per spin for adults aged 25 and over and £2 per spin for 18-24 year olds. These changes bring online slot games in line with existing restrictions on slot machines in casinos. Indeed, online slots are a higher-risk gambling product, associated with large losses, long sessions, and binge play. However, unlike land-based gaming machines which offer broadly similar games, up until now they have had no statutory stake limits.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said:\n“Problem gambling can be devastating for those whose lives it touches, and unfortunately, those numbers are on the rise with NHS Services treating record numbers.\n“This new statutory funding for gambling harms, paid for by gambling companies, will be an important boost to the NHS, whilst helping to address the negative impact of gambling harms on places like Birmingham, Edgbaston through prevention and research.”\nENDS\nNotes to Editors\n• The regulations introducing the levy can be found here: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2025/9780348267211/pdfs/ukdsi_9780348267211_en.pdf\n• The regulations to introduce online stake limits can be found here: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2024/9780348266955\n• The levy will be charged at a set rate for all holders of a given Gambling Commission licence, ranging from 1.1% to 0.1% of Gross Gambling Yield (GGY), or equivalent, depending on the sector.\n• Society lottery operators will pay the levy as a proportion of proceeds retained after good causes and prizes paid out.\n• The UK government will formally review the statutory levy system within five years with the first formal review expected by 2030.",

The latest forecasts of economic growth this year suggest that the UK is struggling to get out of the slow lane, with growth of just 0.2% forecast on the year.\nPreet Kaur Gill, Labour MP for Edgbaston, said:\n“The Tory mortgage penalty is devastating for family finances and is holding back our economy.\n“The country is buckling under 13 years of Conservative mismanagement and a crashed economy, and it is families being asked to pay more on their mortgage once again.\n“People are asking themselves whether they or their family are better off under the Tories.

The Steel Strategy – launched by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds earlier this month – will look at the long-term issues facing the industry like high electricity costs, unfair trading practices, and scrap metal recycling to protect jobs and living standards in the UK’s industrial heartlands.\nAfter years of neglect under the last Conservative Government, up to £2.5 billion will be put towards supporting the steel industry, as per the Labour manifesto, including via the National Wealth Fund. This could benefit regions across the UK – like Scunthorpe, Rotherham, Redcar, Yorkshire, and Scotland – which have a strong history of steel production. It will be spent on initiatives that will give the industry a long future – such as electric arc furnaces, or other improvements to UK capabilities.\nThe Plan is on top of delivering a better deal for Port Talbot within weeks of taking office which will transform production at Port Talbot and deliver a modern Electric Arc Furnace, and implementing the British Industry Supercharger which will cut electricity costs for steel firms and bring prices more in line with international competitors.\nThe Plan for Steel will help with the issues which have been holding the industry back for too long. It will look at ways to:\n· Identify where there are opportunities to expand UK steelmaking to better support UK manufacturing, construction, infrastructure and growth – and secure UK jobs and livelihoods\n· Protect the steel sector from unfair trading practices abroad\n· Improve our scrap processing facilities so they can best support the steel-making of the future\n· Encourage high usage of UK-made steel in public projects\n· Tackle the high electricity prices that have held back the competitiveness of UK steelworks\nWelcoming the Plan for Steel, Preet Kaur Gill, Labour MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“During the election, I said that steel can have a bright future under a Labour Government, and we are delivering on it now with up to £2.5 billion of funding.\n“The announcement of a Plan for Steel is fantastic news for communities across the country, making clear that we are putting the full weight of government behind the industry to protect our industrial heartlands, maintain jobs and drive local growth.\n“I would encourage stakeholders in the West Midlands to feed into the Government’s consultation and I will continue to work with the Government to make sure the Plan for Steel delivers what is needed for our region.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors\nThe consultation can be found here: https://gov.uk/government/consultations/input-into-the-steel-strategy",

Burglary has increased by 11%, knife crime by 29% and vehicle crime by 16% all in the last 12 months.\nThe Conservative Government has cut 20,000 officers nationally and this has filtered down to the West Midlands where £175 million has been cut from Policing budgets and over 2,000 officers have been taken off the streets. Locally, this has meant Quinton and Bartley Green have been forced to share a Policing team.\nHowever, thanks to the collective and ongoing efforts of Preet Kaur Gill, Simon Foster and the support of local Labour Party candidates for Quinton Lauren Rainbow and Sam Forsyth, Quinton will see a new and dedicated Police Sergeant, Bushra Zarif, who will join the ward with Bartley Green retaining Sergeant Mark Short.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “After campaigning for this change to our Police team for a number of years, I’m delighted to welcome Sergeant Zarif to Quinton and to retain Sergeant Short in Bartley Green.\n“Crime has drastically increased over the last decade, but it is our Police officers on the ground that are vital in tackling this. I’ve spent time challenging the number of officers we have available across the constituency, both at a national and regional level to ensure we begin to address this deficit. This has involved many conversations with operational Police teams and our Police and Crime Commissioner. It’s fantastic to see this positive end result.”\nSimon Foster, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner said, “I’ve pledged 450 additional neighbourhood police officers to rebuild community policing. We are making progress and so far, we have delivered nearly half of that pledge. The West Midlands needs preventative, proactive, problem solving and visible policing out on the streets keeping people, their families and communities safe.\n“Violent crime has flourished thanks to a decade of reckless government cuts. My plan will help prevent and tackle violent crime. My 450 neighbourhood officers will make a real difference. However, despite the increase in officer numbers, by 2023 we will still be 1,000 officers short of the offices we had in 2010. That is why I have launched a campaign that seeks cross-party support, to require the government to return our 1,000 missing officers and to provide fair funding for the West Midlands.”\nLauren Rainbow and Sam Forsyth are both Labour’s candidates for Quinton in the upcoming local elections in May following the retirement of Cllr Kate Booth. They said, “We fully support these positive changes that are being brought to Quinton by the collective efforts of our local MP and the Police and Crime Commissioner. It is exciting to see what can be achieved when the Police are backed by a strong Labour team that supports our local Police teams. If elected in May, we will work closely with both Preet and Simon to support plans to return our community to the proper neighbourhood policing it deserves.”",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_preet-kaur-gill-mp-my-weekly-update-20-december/content_41.html": "Preet Kaur Gill MP - My Weekly Update - 20 December\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Dec 20, 2024\n- 8 min read\nLast week I wrote about my Bill to clamp down on blueprints to build 3D printed firearms. This issue had drawn international attention following the indictment of Luigi Mangione in the US over the murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare on the streets of New York.\nThis week, I was delighted that the documentary I have been working on with Channel 4 was released, called “I Printed a Gun: Plastic and Deadly”. I was delighted to be asked on to Times Radio to speak to Jane Garvey about the film and my Bill.\nIkea-like step-by-step guides to printing 3D guns circulate widely online. Last year, a man in Birmingham was convicted of building 3D printed assault rifles in their own home. The new law I have proposed would clamp down on those possessing, sharing and building these lethal weapons.\nYou can watch the full Channel 4 investigation by clicking the button below.\nTaking back our streets\nThis summer at the General Election, I was elected on a promise to take back our streets in Birmingham, Edgbaston. I am proud to say that is exactly what we are going to do.\nThis week, the government has announced the Provisional Police Grant Report, which includes a huge £48 million boost for West Midlands Police next year.\nThe billion-pound boost nationwide means more money to increase the number of officers, PCSOs and special constables in neighbourhood policing teams on our streets. It will help law enforcement deliver on the government’s pledges to halve violence against women and girls, reduce knife crime, crack down on antisocial behaviour, and restore public confidence in our police.\nUnder the Tories, West Midlands Police lost 2,200 officers. Labour has pledged to put more police back on the beat, with 13,000 more officers, PCSOs and special constables in neighbourhood roles and a named officer in every community through our national Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee.\nLabour is taking back control of our streets.\nFunding for Birmingham Hospice\nSince July, I have been contacted by over 100 constituents who are concerned about the dire financial situation hospices were left under the Conservatives. Birmingham Hospice (formerly Birmingham St Mary's Hospice and John Taylor Hospice) has recently had to make a difficult decision to reduce some of its services and make redundancies. I know that the wonderful staff at Birmingham Hospice have touched many local families’ lives.\nAfter lobbying the government about this on my constituents’ behalf, I am therefore extremely pleased to share that the government has agreed to deliver the biggest investment in a generation for hospices, ensuring that hospices can continue to deliver the highest quality end of life care possible for their patients, families, and loved ones.\nThe announcement includes a £100 million boost for adult and children’s hospices to ensure they have the best physical environment for care, and £26 million revenue to support children and young people’s hospices. It will help support hospices and deliver much needed funding for improvements including refurbishments, overhauling IT systems and improving facilities for patients and visitors\nThis is a great early Christmas present for hospices and I’m really pleased that bending the ear of government ministers has paid off. Staff at Birmingham Hospice do a wonderful job at providing support for people with life-limiting conditions. This funding from our Labour Government will make a real difference.\n£1.6 billion for potholes\nSince I was first elected, my inbox has been inundated with constituents who are frustrated about potholes on our roads.\ndamaged roads can risk lives and cost families hundreds if not thousands of pounds on repairs.\nToday, Labour have announced £1.6 billion to fix potholes and do wider highways maintenance work.\nIt’s a 50% increase on what the Conservative Government spent last year and delivers one of our key manifesto pledges, to get Britain moving again.\nFunding boost for GPs\nThis week I have also welcomed an £889 million funding boost for GPs.\nGPs in Edgbaston will be able to spend more time treating patients under Labour's proposed reforms to general practice whichg will bring back the family doctor and slash red tape.\nLabour's plan to end the 8am scramble for appointments is a key manifesto commitment, with action being taken to deliver on those promises and get the NHS back on its feet. Under the proposals, patients in our constituency including those with complex needs, long-term conditions, or the elderly would experience greater continuity of care.\nThe Government is consulting with the British Medical Association on measures including largest boost to GP funding in years and reducing outdated targets to free up time.\nChildren's Wellbeing Bill\nProtecting children at risk of abuse and stopping vulnerable children falling through the cracks are at the heart of a landmark children’s bill introduced to Parliament this week.\nThe Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill is central to delivering on the government’s Plan for Change, which will put children’s futures at the centre of rebuilding public services, and break down barriers to opportunity. The measures will help ensure all children get the best start in life, to drive the sustainable, lasting change that children and families need – and deserve – to achieve and thrive.\nOver recent years, there have been a number of shocking cases of children being failed by a disjointed system. The measures introduced in the Bill will write children’s best interests into law and make child-centred government a reality.\nIn recent years, too many children have been failed by their last line of defence: the state. This bill will be a seminal moment for child protection. No more words, no more lessons learnt. This government will put children first at every turn.\nThat means a child-centred government, with better protections for young people and real join up between children’s social care, schools and local services. Alongside further measures to drive high and rising standards in our schools, this bill will deliver on this government’s Plan for Change, so that all children, whatever their circumstances, can achieve and thrive.\nHomes for Heroes\nA major deal to bring the Armed Forces housing estate back into public ownership has been agreed by the government. The deal will secure 36,347 military homes to improve housing for forces' families and save taxpayers billions.\nThe major deal unlocks new-build housing projects for military families plus essential refurbishments, and will put an end to a huge annual rental bill to save around £230 million per year.\nLocal News\n£17.7 million to tackle homelessness in Birmingham\nLabour has inherited a housing crisis at boiling point, and we can’t keep sticking plasters on it. It is a national disgrace that homelessness and rough sleeping levels are at an all-time high with more than 123,000 households living in temporary accommodation after 14 years of failure.\nI have been campaigning on homelessness since I was elected in 2017. The homelessness crisis in Birmingham has spiralled over the last 14 years. In Birmingham, 10.9 households per 1,000 are living in temporary accommodation, significantly above the English average excluding London of 2.4. Across the West Midlands, more than 12,000 children face spending Christmas without a regular home.\nUnder the Tories, the use of temporary accommodation has reached record levels. In the 50 authorities with the highest levels of temporary accommodation in England, nearly 14,000 households have been in temporary accommodation for more than five years, according to an FOI request. In Birmingham, one household has been in stop-gap housing since at least 2011.\nThat is why this week I have welcomed the announcement of £17.7 million to help tackle homelessness in Birmingham, as part of a government announcement of a record nearly £1 billion for councils to help break the cycle next year. The package includes £5 million for pilots to reduce emergency accommodation in areas with the highest use of B&Bs, including Birmingham.\nI have campaigned on housing and homelessness since I was elected in 2017. Over the years, I have helped hundreds of homeless constituents with their housing situation, as well as supporting local food banks, baby banks, mobile kitchens and food collections to support homeless families and rough sleepers in our constituency. Constituents I have been supporting include a mum and three children confined to a single hotel room.\nThis announcement of more than £17m of funding for Birmingham, including a pilot to end B&B use, will be gamechanging for our city, alongside the Government's plan to build 1.5 million homes this Parliament, ban no fault evictions, and deliver the biggest increase in social housing in a generation.\nThe funding announced this week will change the lives of many families in my constituency who are currently stuck in cramped, emergency accommodation with no access to kitchens or utilities of their own. This will be a huge step forwards for Birmingham.\nThat is the difference with Labour.\nUHB\nThis week I was asked to speak to BBC Midlands about news that 300 consultants have expressed no confidence in the leadership at University Hospitals Birmingham.\nOver the years, I have worked with over 100 doctors, surgeons and staff at UHB who have expressed concerns about practices at the Trust. It led to the Bewick Review last year, which I am proud to have played my part in scrutinising and holding leaders at UHB to account.\nSunlight is always the best disinfectant. That’s why I’ve called for the Trust to release the reports commissioned as part of the Bewick recommendations last year.\nHagley Road Metro Scheme\nThis week I was pleased to Chair the first meeting of a strategic steering group for the Hagley Road Metro Scheme, a project designed to improve connectivity on our busy commuter corridor.\nI’m privileged to chair the steering group. A reliable transport network is critical to people’s lives. By delivering better transport, we’ll ensure people have proper access to jobs and opportunities – powering economic growth in the West Midlands.\nThe Hagley Road is a vital commuter corridor, and this scheme aims to take advantage of that by improving travel along it. It will also aim to reduce congestion by introducing alternative travel methods and help make our city greener by incentivising public transport, cycling and walking.\nAfter years of campaigning for better connectivity in our region, I’m excited to be working with local representatives to ensure that this scheme is implemented in a way that delivers better transport solutions for all.\nThe Hagley Road Metro Scheme is integral to Labour’s mission to improve infrastructure and connectivity across the country. Last month, the government committed an additional £50m funding for the West Midlands Combined Authority to deliver better buses across the West Midlands.\nVarious options are currently being explored by Transport for West Midlands to improve connectivity along Hagley Road, and the report into a rapid transit scheme will be presented to the group early in January 2025.\nChristmas and New Year waste collection\nDuring the festive period, many households have more rubbish than usual, and much of this can be reused or recycled.\nOver Christmas and New Year, there will be some changes to waste and recycling collections, with information available on the Council’s website at the link below.\nBirmingham City Council is asking local residents to continue to separate their waste, only use rubbish bins for things that cannot be reused or recycled, and collapse cardboard boxes before putting them in the recycling.\nMerry Christmas!\nWishing you and your loved ones a peaceful and merry Christmas and New Year.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

As we approach the Bank Holiday, for all those celebrating, I hope you have a wonderful few days. Easter is about resurrection, new life and new beginnings. With so much change over the last few days from the pandemic, the cost of living, I hope you are able to take a moment to rest and recharge.\nHowever, the Easter Bank Holiday will also mean that my usual April advice surgery will fall tomorrow on Good Friday and so unfortunately, they will be cancelled. My next advice surgery date will be Thursday 13 April at Edgbaston Community Centre between 10.30-11.30am.\nIn the meantime, if you would like my support with any issue, please get in touch on 0121 392 8426 or preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk and I would be more than happy to help.\nCalling for greater enforcement action on illegal and obstructive parking\nEvery week, I hear from people in my constituency about inconsiderate parking on the school drop off and pick up. When I speak to teachers in our local schools, they tell me when they approach motorists they're threatened with foul language and abusive behaviour. This all too often is happening in the presence of young children. Not only is this unacceptable behaviour, but it is also incredibly dangerous. My biggest fear is about the safety of children trying to cross roads, whose view and path may be obstructed by cars parked on pavements.\nYet, it is in our power to stop this. If we each take a pledge to be more careful and considerate when driving, our communities do not need this added worry.\nI appreciate the efforts the council are taking, including their work to support schools with active travel and their various schemes like the Keep Schools Clear campaign.\nSimilarly, I commend schools for regularly writing to parents in their newsletters about this dangerous behaviour. Without doubt, though, the most effective tool in our arsenal is enforcement action. That is why I have written to the Cabinet Member for Transport at Birmingham City Council, Cllr Liz Clements, regarding illegal and obstructive parking.\nIn my letter I have asked:\nHow many full time and part time parking enforcement officers are currently employed by Birmingham City Council; and has this number remained steady, increased, or decreased in recent years?\nOn a typical shift, how many roads will a parking enforcement officer be tasked with inspecting?\nDo Birmingham City Council have any intention to employ more parking enforcement officers? Considering the number of cases I deal with on a weekly basis regarding parking, I believe greater numbers are required. Therefore, if the answer is no, then what is the reason for this?\nHow many mobile camera cars do Birmingham City Council operate? A camera car was used in my constituency in the Autumn term after months of complaining to the Council about a particular school but that was for only one term.\nCan Birmingham City Council designate a mobile camera car specifically for use towards tackling school parking? If this is not currently an option, can another vehicle be purchased for this?\nConsidering self-reporting by residents, how many reports of obstructive parking have you received in the past twelve months? Of those cases closed, how many resulted in enforcement action and how many did not?\nStatement from the UHB Cross-Party Reference Group\nLast week I shared how the findings from the first phase of a three-part review looking into University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) were released. As Chair of the Cross-Party Reference Group, which is in place to hold the three reviews to account, I brought the Group together to discuss the findings.\nGiven Professor Bewick had just six weeks to investigate and has only been able to offer limited recommendations, the report still paints a disturbing picture of serious failings at UHB. UHB touches the lives of so many, at a time when patients are at their most vulnerable. The Cross-Party Reference Group wants them to succeed. It is therefore imperative that the reviews are seen as the beginning of the journey so that we can implement the learning and create a culture that fosters openness for better patient outcomes.\nLabour launches mission to halve violence against women and girls\nNew analysis has this week revealed that the number of rape survivors dropping their case has more than doubled since 2015. That is why I’m proud Labour Leader Keir Starmer will highlight our national mission to halve levels of violence against women and girls and increase confidence in every police force.\nJust last week, we saw Deputy Labour Leader, Angela Raynor, challenge the Deputy Prime Minister on the Conservative track record which now shows a collapsing confidence from women in the justice system. A staggering 41.6% of rape survivors are now pulling out of pursuing their case. This is a huge increase given in 2015, this stood at 19.7%.\nWith less than two in every 100 reported rapists charged in the last year, justice for rape survivors is diminishing. The alarming figures come amid record court backlogs and an average three-year wait for justice for rape survivors - which Starmer branded a “stain on our country”.\nLabour will put victims back at the heart of the system. We’ll stop victims going through the harrowing experience of waiting months, sometimes years for justice. We will:\nGive minimum custodial sentences of seven years of perpetrators of rape.\nEnd the postcode lottery of support by putting specialist domestic abuse workers and a specialist rape and sexual offence unit in every police force.\nTackle misogyny by making it a specific hate crime and taking action on online harms.\nSet up dedicated rape courts to prioritise listing of rape cases and reform the experience of going to court for survivors, so they feel empowered to come forward.\nRaise standards and confidence in every police force, with mandatory national vetting, training and misconduct standards.\nApply to join my brilliant team!\nI’m recruiting a new caseworker role in my constituency office in Edgbaston. Edgbaston constituency covers Harborne, Bartley Green, Quinton, Edgbaston and part of North Edgbaston.\nThe cost of living is having a significant impact on residents across the constituency. I have seen this first hand as the number of people contacting me and looking for support has significantly increased with requests ranging from immigration to housing, benefits to health requests. That is why I am looking for someone with experience with casework whether that is in the public sector, at a charity or another fast-paced role.\nSo, if you have a passion for helping people and want to join my brilliant team, please look at the job description and apply. The closing date is 12 April at 5pm.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

The news came as the firm was summoned to Parliament to answer questions from MPs over widespread shortcomings in services it provides to leaseholders.\nPreet Kaur Gill has challenged FirstPort publicly over its failure to manage financial information and accounts for hundreds of properties in her constituency, leading to delays of almost a year in settling finances with a new managing agent after its contract was terminated. In one case, it has led to grinding delays in transferring leaseholder funds totalling nearly half a million pounds.\nWriting to the CEO of TPI, MP Gill challenges the decision to quietly restore FirstPort’s accreditation, and questions the value of accreditation as a watermark of “the highest standards of service and professionalism” – as claimed on TPI’s website.\nThe government has acknowledged that there is a strong case for greater regulation of managing agents as part of its commitment to leasehold reform, with a consultation on the regulation of managing agents due later this year. The previous Conservative government promised to regulate the property agent sector in 2018, but failed to do so.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“The shocking delays and mismanagement of residential accounts in my constituency demonstrates that FirstPort is failing to meet the minimum standards leaseholders should expect. For that reason I find it baffling that The Property Institute has quietly reinstated FirstPort’s membership last month.\n“Many managing agents do a good job and will be crucial in the transition to commonhold, but too often leaseholders are being let down. More needs to be done protect leaseholders from abuse and poor service at the hands of unscrupulous agents.\n“The sector must get its own house in order, or the new government should regulate it, where the last failed to for too long.”\nENDS\nNotes\n1.

Now, with funding from the Labour government, they are able to offer a healthy start for kids and 30 minutes of childcare before the school bell rings.\nAs well as offering a healthy breakfast of fruit, toast and cereal, the school also put on activities for children attending the breakfast club. World’s End Infant and Nursery School is one of 750 schools to open free breakfast clubs across the country.\nParents will be able to save up to £450 per year if their child attends free breakfast clubs every day. This amount rises to a saving of up to £8,000 every year when combining Labour’s free breakfast clubs with further support through the expansion of government-funded childcare and new school uniform cap on branded items.\nWith the cost of everyday essentials stretching budgets, these clubs will be a lifeline for working families simply trying to get by. When you’re raising a family, every penny counts and that’s why the Labour government is stepping in to ease the pressure and put money back in parent’s pockets.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said:\n“It was brilliant to see so many children excited to be back at school this morning, throwing themselves into activities and having a healthy start to the day at their free government-funded breakfast club.\n“Worlds End Infant and Nursery School in Quinton has never had a free breakfast club because they couldn’t afford one. Now, with support from our Labour government, they are one of 750 early adopter schools to launch free breakfast clubs this month. This is the difference a Labour government makes.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said:\n“As a parent, I know that the combined pressures of family life and work can often feel impossible to juggle. That is why our manifesto promised to make parents lives easier and put more money in their pockets with free breakfast clubs. Under a year since we came into office, this government is delivering that through our Plan for Change.\n“The rollout of free breakfast clubs is a truly game-changing moment for families in this country. They mean parents will no longer be hamstrung by rigid school hours and have the breathing space they need to beat the morning rush, attend work meetings and doctors’ appointments, or run errands. And crucially, it means better life chances for children.\n“By making these clubs free and universal, we’re doing something that previous governments have never done. We’re going further and faster to deliver the change working families deserve. That’s the change this government was elected to deliver.”\nENDS",

All of our thoughts are with the families and everyone affected by the unimaginable horrors that unfolded in Southport.\nWe must make sure that this doesn’t happen again. We have launched a public inquiry and will review our entire counter-extremist system to make sure that we can face up to this new threat. Read Keir Starmer’s full statement here.\nKnife Crime\nFrom the debate on knife crime in the West Midlands\nThis week, we tragically lost 12-year-old Leo Ross, who was fatally stabbed on his way home from school in Hall Green.\nKnife crime is a crisis in our communities. In recent years, I have been witness to some horrific cases – in every one, what strikes you immediately is the senselessness of it.\nJordan Moazami was 18 years old, and described as a ‘role model’ by his peers – who was stabbed and killed on Tennal Road in my constituency in 2019.\nMuhammad Hassam Ali, 17 years old, who was followed and killed by a 15-year-old after a four minute conversation in Birmingham City Centre.\nDea-John Reid, my constituent, 14 years old, was hounded by a gang of five boys and grown men before being stabbed in the chest in 2021.\nUnder the Conservatives, knife crime became an epidemic. In July, the ONS found knife crime in England and Wales had shot up by 78% over the past ten years. Across England and Wales, there were 50,000 knife related crimes in the Year to March 2023, around 5,000 of those in the West Midlands Police Force area.\nThis week, I spoke in a debate on knife crime in the West Midlands, where I expressed my concern about the rise of serious violence among young people and welcomed the Government’s commitment to halve knife crime in a decade.\nFor far too long, it has been shockingly easy for our children to get their hands on deadly knives. The government has now introduced new laws which will require online retailers to ask anyone buying a knife for two types of identification, such as a passport or driving licence, and also record a live video to prove their age.\nLabour is working to tackle violent crime in our communities by delivering a vital funding boost of up to £1 billion in 2025-2026 for police forces across England and Wales, with £48 million for West Midlands Police. This package includes £100 million to kickstart the recruitment of 13,000 neighbourhood officers and £50 million for Violence Reduction Units to tackle knife crime.\nWe have also announced a package of measures to help us achieve our mission to halve knife crime in a decade.\nA new Young Futures programme – with new Prevention Partnerships and youth hubs so we can intervene earlier to prevent at-risk young people from being drawn into violent crime\nA ban on ninja sorts and fines for senior social media execs who fail to remove illegal knife crime content from their platforms\nOnline retailers to be forced to ask anyone buying a knife for two types of identification, with buyers asked to submit an identity document, such as a passport, and record a live video to prove their age\nA new coalition to tackle knife-enabled crime, working together with technology companies, sport organisations, the health service, the police, and the families of victims\nA new offence of criminal exploitation of children, to go after the gangs who are luring young people into violence and crime\nA plan to plan to place youth workers and mentors in A&E units and Pupil Referral Units, to identify and help those children and young people who are victims of serious violence and exploitation\nHousing\nIf we want growth, we need the infrastructure to support it. For 14 years, the Conservatives have let Nimbys and zealots clog up our legal system and stop the government building the infrastructure Britain needs.\nThis Labour Government is backing the builders, not the blockers. We’re fast-tracking 150 infrastructure projects, giving us the GP surgeries, roads, railways, the reservoirs and grids for the new homes, towns and villages we’re going to build.\nWe’re also scrapping the excessive three attempts to challenge decisions in the courts to stop blockers getting in the way of the government’s central mission to grow the economy. Read more here.\nFraud\nThis week, we have launched the biggest welfare fraud crackdown in a generation.\nThis means welfare fraudsters who cheated the taxpayer out of £7 billion last year could be banned from driving if they repeatedly fail to reimburse the public and repay their debt. Read more here.\nBusiness and Trade\nWith Labour in government, the UK has now risen to become the second-most attractive global destination for international investment, according to global CEOs.\nWe are delivering investment to grow our economy and make working people better off. Read more here.\nSecurity\nA major deal, worth approximately £9 billion, has been struck with British firm Rolls-Royce to bolster support to the Royal Navy’s fleet of nuclear submarines, boosting national security and economic growth. This represents a major boost for economic growth, creating and maintaining 5,000 long-term UK jobs. Read more here.\nEthnicities Bill\nSikhs and Jews have been legally recognised as ethnic groups for over 40 years. Both are in the unique position of being recognised as both an ethnicity and a religion in the Equality Act 2010. But both communities have been missed out by public bodies not recording them as ethnic groups.\nI have presented a bill to Parliament which will would provide that, where a public body collects data about ethnicity for the purpose of delivering public services, it must include specific “Sikh” and “Jewish” categories as options for a person’s ethnic group.\nRead my full piece for Politics Home here.\n3D Guns\nThis week, an extremist was arrested and found to be in possession of 3D printing gun instructions. It’s terrifying how easy it is for these blueprints to get into the wrong hands.\nI have presented a bill to Parliament which would make it illegal to download and possess the blueprints to 3D-print a gun. You can read more about my bill here.\nTrade Remedies Authority\nHosting Trade Remedies Parliamentary Reception\nIt was great to host the Trade Remedies Parliamentary Reception, bringing together industry leaders, producers, policy makers and Parliamentarians. The work they do is vital in defending UK economic interests against unfair international trading practices.\nUniversity of Birmingham\nAfter I visited the University of Birmingham to hear about an education toolkit they were launching, it was great to meet again in Parliament to learn more about how this pack of resources can help primary schools to involve all pupils in developing a whole school approach to mental health and wellbeing.\nI would urge schools to consult the toolkit. You can find it, and more information, here.\nLocal News - Birmingham City Council\nThis week, it was great to meet with the new Senior Leadership Team at Birmingham City Council, including Managing Director Joanne Roney and Deputy Chief Executive Rishi Shori.\nI look forward to working together to address some of the city’s challenges along with sharing its successes too. I raised the Hagley Road Metro Scheme, how to deliver more housing, libraries and day centre cuts.\nI'm glad the council has listened to my suggestions and is encouraging local groups to take over or partner with facilities at risk, like libraries.\nI asked the council if they could provide more information about how these groups can express their interest. Read my full letter to Rob Pocock here.\nLeasehold\nI wrote to First Post on behalf of several constituents who have contacted me about financial mismanagement and poor service they have received from FirstPort acting as their managing agent.\nThe slow transfer of funds from Firstport has been causing serious issues to leaseholders in my constituency. I asked FirstPort to ensure that this money is transferred as soon as possible.\nRead my full letter here:\nHarborne Ward Forum\nThe next ward meeting for Harborne ward will take place on Monday 17th February, 6.30pm at Harborne Leisure Centre, Lordswood Road, Harborne, B17 9QS. I hope you’ll be able to attend to raise any issues you face in your area.\nKeep Warm and Well\nThe Edgbaston Neighbourhood Network Scheme are holding a Keep Warm and Well community event in Bartley Green. There will be members of the community, various organisations with stalls, and will be offering lifestyle checks, welfare benefit checks, home energy advice and more.\nThe event takes place on Monday 3rd February 10am to 2pm at Milebrook Hall, Field Lane, Bartley Green, Birmingham B32 3JT.\nLocal Alliance\nI’m pleased to announce that the University of Birmingham and Birmingham City Football Club (BCFC) have announced a strategic alliance, creating opportunities in research, education and health, raising aspirations across Birmingham, and enhancing the city’s reputation on the global stage.\nThe alliance will enable the University community of 40,000 students and 8,000 staff to have access to a local football club, providing internships, job opportunities and entertainment. BCFC’s Academy will also benefit from a sophisticated character education programme, developed by the University.\nRead more here.\nMHWC\nOn Monday, 27th January, the MHWC will be visiting Simmons Drive in Quinton, B32 1SL, and on Wednesday, 29th January, Glencoe Road in North Edgbaston, B16 0PB.

This is in comparison to the end of Labour’s time in office, when it was at a high of 70 per cent.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “After 13 years of Conservative mismanagement, the NHS is in crisis. Nurses are striking for the first time in their 100-year history, people are finding it impossible to get a GP appointment or an operation when they need one and, in an emergency, there’s no guarantee an ambulance will arrive. Simply put, the longer the Conservatives are in power, the longer patients will wait, often in pain and distress.\n“However, we can’t build a healthy economy without a healthy society. That is why I’m proud that your next Labour government will not just rely on sticking plasters, but grasp the root cause of the crisis in the NHS. This will be done by ensuring more doctors, more nurses, shorter waiting times, better care. That’s the difference a Labour government will make.”\nLabour’s plan will see a new generation of doctors, nurses, and midwives to treat patients on time again.\nLabour will double the number of medical school places, train 10,000 extra nurses and midwives every year, double the number of district nurses qualifying each year and create 5,000 more health visitors paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status, because patients need treatment more than the wealthiest need a tax break.\nLabour will make the NHS fit for the future, so it delivers better care for the patient and better value for the taxpayer. Prevention is better than cure, so we shift the focus of care out of the hospital and into the community, reforming primary care so we can diagnose patients quicker and intervene earlier.",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-13-april/content_287.html": "My Weekly update - 13 April\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Apr 13, 2023\n- 4 min read\nUpdated: Jan 30, 2024\nAhead of Friday, I want to wish a very happy Vaisakhi to my many wonderful Sikh constituents, and everyone who is celebrating across the UK and around the world. Vaisakhi is a celebration of the creation of the Khalsa by the 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji. It’s a time for us to reflect on the devotion of the Panj Pyare, the five beloved ones, and the values on which the Khalsa Panth was founded — the defence of freedom, equality, and the betterment of all.\nThe teachings of the Gurus remind us that the human race is one under God, and how we should work towards the wellbeing of all, sarbat da bhallah. Now it is more important than ever for us to think about how we can further global equality and tackle the issues around social justice that we are often seeing on a daily basis. I hope that you’ll be able to visit your Gurdwara, celebrate safely with your families and join some of the many virtual Vaisakhi events taking place this week. Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh\nTory sewage scandal sullies Edgbaston constituency with raw sewage dumping every 3 days\nLast year, the Conservatives allowed 153 spillages of raw sewage to be dumped into Edgbaston’s open spaces, new figures have revealed.\nAnalysis of Environment Agency data shows that in 2022, raw sewage was discharged into Edgbaston’s water for 213 hours, the equivalent of there being a continuous flow of sewage taking place for a staggering 9 consecutive days.\nThe research points to 153 sewage dumping events having taken place locally last year, a damning indictment of the Tories allowing raw sewage to polluting the places in which people live and work.\nThe data comes after Labour analysis revealed that nationally since 2016, a new sewage dumping event has taken place an average of every two-and-a-half minutes, with rivers, lakes, seas, and beaches having faced a staggering 1,276 years’ worth of raw sewage over just a seven-year period.\nOur constituency is so fortunate to have beautiful open spaces like Bartley Green Reservoir, Woodgate Valley and the Bournbrook. However, it is horrifying to think that these incredible assets are being turned into sewers.\nWhile we have heard much about sewage being dumped into our seas, as a land locked city, many don’t think this issue affects us here in Birmingham. However, this new data shows that, that is simply not the case.\nThis is an issue the Conservatives have actively encouraged. Conservative MPs not only voted to allow water firms to continue sewage dumping, but blocked a Labour-backed amendment that would have progressively eliminated sewage dumping. I am horrified that Birmingham-based MPs Andrew Mitchell and Gary Sambrook could have voted for such measures.\nThe news will inevitably once again spark serious concern at the environmental, health and economic impact that sewage dumping is having on communities across the country. That the Tories have allowed villages, towns, and cities across the country to be treated as open sewers shows that they have no respect for places where people live, work and holiday.\nCommunities in Edgbaston Constituency should be able to just enjoy the place where they live without having to worrying about encountering filthy raw sewage.\nThe next Labour Government will end the Tory sewage scandal, delivering mandatory monitoring on all sewage outlets, introducing automatic fines for discharges, setting ambitious targets for stopping systematic sewage dumping and ensuring that water bosses are held to account for negligence.\nHow Labour will revitalise local high streets\nHigh streets have been the target of rising costs due to Tory economic mismanagement, steep tax rises and spiking energy bills. Meanwhile, a decade of low growth means footfall has plummeted across the country and firms have struggled to attract customers. All of this has led to more boarded-up shops, making high streets less pleasant places to shop, eat and relax.\nThe UK has lost over 6,000 pubs, nearly 4,000 local shops and 9,000 bank branches from local high streets under the Conservatives.\nYet, it isn’t just businesses who are feeling the impact. Local customers have also fallen victim to the harsh increase in price of everyday essentials, as costs have skyrocketed by a further £3,500 due to Tory mismanagement of the cost of living crisis.\nLabour has announced a new plan to reverse the 13 years of decline and revitalise local high streets, with policies to cut business rates, cut energy bills, stamp out late payments, revamp empty shops and tackle anti-social behaviour.\nCut business rates: high street businesses shouldn’t face big tax hikes whilst online giants are let off the hook. Labour would cut business rates for small businesses on the high street, paid for by properly taxing online giants. Our policy would be worth over £2.6k to the average pub, café or restaurant.\nCut energy bills: many beloved high street businesses face an uncertain future due to spiking energy bills. Labour will help them cut their bills for good with vouchers for energy efficiency measures – such as double glazing at a local cinema, a new heat pump in a café or an electric vehicle for a takeaway.\nStamp out late payments: high street firms shouldn’t be forced to wait months to be paid for work by big clients. Labour would introduce tough new laws to stamp out late payments and make sure more money gets to high street firms.\nRevamp empty shops: people won’t visit high streets blighted by unsightly boarded up shops. Labour will give councils strong new powers to bring empty shops on their high streets back into use.\nTackle anti-social behaviour: people should feel safe when they go out to shop, eat or have fun on their local high street. Labour will get 13,000 more neighbourhood police and PCSOs back on our streets and introduce tough new measures to crack down on anti-social behaviour that blights local high streets.\nApply to join my brilliant team!\nI’m recruiting a new communications and campaigns role in my constituency office in Edgbaston. Edgbaston constituency covers Harborne, Bartley Green, Quinton, Edgbaston and part of North Edgbaston.\nI am looking for someone who is experienced, dynamic and as driven to solve problems relating to anti-social parking as they are to campaigning for an end to poverty pay.\nSo, if you have a passion for brilliant communication and want to join my team, please look at the job description and apply. The closing date is 19 April at 5pm.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Securing a lasting peace in Ukraine that safeguards its sovereignty for the long term is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future.\nThis is the moment for us all to step up, and the UK will do so because it is the right thing to do, and because it is crucial to our own national security. You can read Keir Starmer’s article in The Telegraph here.\nNHS\nThis week, our Labour Government met our manifesto pledge of delivering two million extra NHS appointments – seven months early. These include appointments for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endoscopy, and diagnostic tests as the government delivers its first steps to fix our health service.\nSince Labour were elected in July 2024, hospital waiting lists have been falling consistently. University Hospitals Birmingham has cut waiting lists by almost 5%, twice the rate of the rest of the country over the same period.\nWe know the job isn’t done. Our government is determined to go further and faster to deliver more appointments, faster treatment, and a National Health Service that the British public deserve. Read more here.\nRail Consultation\nOn Tuesday, we launched a consultation on Great British Railways so that we can create a unified, simplified rail network that will put passengers first, raise living standards and boost growth.\nPart of the government’s plans include setting up a new rail watchdog to give passengers a voice and hold railways to account. We will also be giving devolved leaders more of a say on the services that directly impact their towns and cities, working together to integrate transport, making it simpler to travel and attracting more people to our railways.\nRead more and have your say on the future of our railways here.\nKnives\nA clip from my speech on knife crime in the West Midlands\nToo many people have tragically died because of knife crime.\nOn Wednesday, the Home Secretary announced that the government is introducing stricter rules for online retailers selling knives, along with tougher penalties for failing to the enforce them.\nRonan Kanda was tragically killed in Wolverhampton in a knife attack in 2022 – his killers were under 18 and had been able to buy deadly knifes and swords online. Ronan’s Law’, introduced in memory of Ronan Kanda will require retailers to report any bulk or suspicious-looking purchases of knives on their platforms to police to prevent illegal resales happening across social media accounts.\nThe government is also increasing the sentence for selling weapons to under 18s from 6 months to up to 2 years prison time.\nRead my full speech on tackling knife crime in the West Midlands here.\nDentistry\nNHS dentistry has been left broken after years of neglect, with patients left in pain without appointments, or queueing around the block just to be seen.\nOur Labour Government is delivering on our manifesto commitment to roll out 700,000 extra urgent dental appointments across the country, benefitting hundreds of thousands of patients.\nNHS England has written to integrated care boards (ICB) across the country, directing health chiefs in each region to stand up thousands of urgent appointments over the next year. “Dental deserts”, where patients struggle to get appointments, are being targeted. Read more here.\nViolence Against Women and Girls\nTo deliver on our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade, our Labour Government has launched Raneem's Law to embed the first domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms.\nRaneem’s Law was established in memory of Raneem Oudeh and her mother Khaola Saleem, who were murdered by Raneem’s ex-husband in August 2018. There were 13 reports made to the police about concerns for Raneem’s safety, but no arrests were made. On the night she was killed, she rang 999 four times, but the police did not respond in time.\nI’m glad that West Midlands Police is one of the five forces pioneering this new approach. Read more here.\nArts and Culture Announcement\nArts and culture are enjoyed by people across our country and make a huge contribution to our economy. I welcome the Government's announcement of over £270 million to support hundreds of arts venues, museums, libraries and the heritage sector. Read more here.\nIt’s also great news that regional growth and regeneration will get a much-needed boost as 10 major culture projects across the UK will receive more than £67 million in Government funding. This includes investment in our region:\n£5 million for City Centre Cultural Gateway in Coventry, that will support the repurposing of the former IKEA building in Coventry city centre to become a new cultural and visitor attraction.\n£2.3 million to three cultural projects in Worcester, these three projects will deliver new cultural and public spaces around the Scala arts venue\nRead more here.\nBaby Formula\nWith Labour activist Elaine Hook at Quinton Baby Bank\nThe price of baby formula is soaring, with the cheapest brand shooting up by 45% in just two years, way above inflation. This means, on average, a single tin costs an eye-watering £12, making it difficult for struggling families to feed their infants.\nIt was great to see that the Competition and Markets Authority has said parents should be allowed to use vouchers and loyalty points to buy infant formula, a win for the Metro and charity Feed’s Formula for Change campaign.\nI backed the campaign to update the legislation that currently prohibits parents and carers from using cash equivalent methods, such as Nectar, Tesco Clubcard and Boots loyalty points, store gift cards, or grocery vouchers provided by foodbanks and local authorities, to purchase infant formula.\nRead my op-ed supporting the Formula for Change campaign here.\nCo-op and Labour Event\nAs Parliamentary Group Chair of the Co-operative Party, it was great to take part in a session on the history of the co-operative movement and its relationship with the Labour Party.\nThank you to all who attended.\nLocal News\nWelcoming Exceptional Funding Support for Birmingham\nWith Birmingham City Council's executive team\nBirmingham City Council, the largest local authority in Europe, has been decimated by budget cuts under the Conservatives. Since 2010, the council has been stripped of £1 billion and as a result, residents have had to suffer cuts to vital services.\nOur Labour government is committed to working in partnership with councils and protecting the interests of local residents.\nI'm glad that our Labour Government has announced this week that Birmingham City Council, along with 29 other councils, will be receiving additional financial support through the Exceptional Financial Support process. Birmingham has been provided with an in-principle capitalisation for 24/25 of £490m and 25/26 of £180m, which will help the council recover from the financial challenges it faces.\nIt's also welcome news that for the first time, additional expectations have been set to protect treasured community assets, culture and identity, with councils using capitalisation instructed not to dispose of community and heritage assets.\nDudley Road Walkabout\nOn a walkabout on Dudley Road\nOn Tuesday, I joined Winson Green and Ladywood Police teams, Cllr Sharon Thompson and local community representatives on a walkabout on Dudley Road in North Edgbaston.\nI have had constituents contact me raising issues with crime, antisocial behaviour, flytipping and parking. I look forward to working with residents and the council to bring vital investment in the local area.\nSpeed Van Announcement\nSince I was elected as an MP, improving road safety has been a priority.\nI'm glad that thanks to my campaigning for tougher speeding measures, Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster has committed to doubling the region's fleet of mobile speed camera vans. Read more here.\nRegional Energy Strategy\nThe Mayor, Richard Parker, has launched a new Regional Energy Strategy for the West Midlands, which will help our region become a national leader in smart energy.\nThe strategy outlines the powers and funding needed to introduce cutting-edge technology that will transform the way energy is generated, stored and used. This is another step towards a new era of cleaner, more resilient and cheaper energy and will support the transition to net zero. Read more here.\nPotholes\nWith Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander\nSince I was first elected, my inbox has been inundated with constituents who are frustrated about potholes on our roads. I have worked with the council to get potholes filled across the constituency and have onsistently campaigned for safer roads.\nIt’s great news that Richard Parker has secured an extra £8 million – a 30% increase - in the region’s highway repair funding to fill more potholes and resurface bad roads. This is on top of the £24 million already awarded from the Government for 2025-6. You can read more here.\nSee my letter to Richard Parker asking about the allocation for my constituency, here:\nKenrick Centre\nIt’s very disappointing news that the Kenrick Centre in Harborne, which supports adults with various needs and is a vital step-down service to support discharges from hospital, may close down.\nI have asked the council to retain the service by pooling resources with NHS partners locally. You can read my full letter here.\nMissed Bins\nConstituents have contacted me to say that their bin collections have been missed. You can report missed collections here.\nMHWC\nNext week, the MHWC will be visiting Leigham Drive in Quinton, B17 8AT, on Monday 24th February, and Hermitage Road in Edgbaston, B15 3UP, on Friday 28th February.

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-19-july/content_27.html": "My Weekly Update - 19 July\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Jul 19, 2024\n- 5 min read\nDear all,\nThis week saw the state opening of Parliament, and the delivery of the King’s Speech. This is where the government sets out its legislative agenda for the new Parliament, and where for the first time we get to see the gamut of Bills that the government wants to introduce to the statute book.\nAs usual, I was in Parliament to witness proceedings, and what a difference this was to the thin gruel of the last Kings Speech I witnessed in November. This was a packed programme for government, including over 40 Bills, ranging from a Bill to set up Great British Energy, to a Bill to put sewage-dumping water companies in special measures, to a Bill to abolish hereditary peers. There’s lots in there, and it will certainly be keeping me busy over the next few years as your MP!\nThere were a couple of Bills that I was especially pleased to see announced. One was the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which is something I worked on through the last Parliament as shadow public health minister until all progress was lost when the election was called in May. This will include measures to phase out smoking from our society over time, and provide the Government new powers to crack down on youth vaping. The government has also committed to implement policies I worked on, such as a ban on the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s.\nAnother was the Renter’s Rights Bill. Successive Conservative governments have been promising reform for renter’s rights, including a ban on no-fault evictions, for the best part of 10 years. Finally now, we will have a government that will put those changes into law. It’s also great news for some of my constituents that leasehold reform is back on the table, which over recent years has been exposed as the feudal system it is, especially in the wake of the cladding scandal and the Grenfell Tower tragedy.\nLastly, I am delighted to see a real commitment from the new Government to a new wave of devolution, transferring power from Westminster to the West Midlands. The Railways Bill and Better Buses Bill will pave the way to bring our public transport back into public ownership, and I hope spell an era of more flexible, affordable and accountable services, under local communities’ control.\nThis is an exciting new era, where after years of chaos we can finally begin to renew and rebuild our country. If you’d like to find out more about what was in the King’s Speech, you can find more information here and here.\nThe most representative Parliament ever\nThis week it was lovely to catch up with Labour women colleagues, new and old. The new Parliament is the most representative of the country ever, with 263 (40%) female MPs out of 650 (190 of them from Labour alone!).\nMore than 13% of MPs now come from an ethnic minority background, including ten new Sikh MPs. I was delighted to be the first ever Sikh woman elected to Parliament in 2017, and it is such a pleasure to see a new generation joining me now.\nWhatever your background, it is important that Parliament is slowly coming to look more like the people it serves.\nMy new job\nI am delighted to announce that this week I have been appointed as the PPS to the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Jonathan Reynolds.\nI will be joining a brilliant team of Ministers with a key role in delivering the Labour government’s number one mission to unlock investment and grow our economy, after 14 years of stagnation.\nFrom Labour’s agenda to make work pay, to decarbonise our economy, to bring the voice of small business into the heart of government, and to bring economic growth to every part of the country, it’s a wide-ranging and important portfolio and one I’m looking forward to playing my part.\nMe on Politics Live\nOn Tuesday, I appeared on the BBC’s daytime politics show, Politics Live. On a panel of two Conservatives and one Green MP, I was quizzed about Labour’s new strategic defence review to what the new government will do to tackle child poverty.\nIn particular, we talked about Labour's plans to set up Great British Energy, a new public owned renewable energy generation company to motor our drive for clean power by 2030. It emerged this week the Green Party's co-leader has objected to infrastructure to carry clean energy from offshore wind through his constituency. I was surprised to hear the Green Party leader defend a decision to slow down our progress to hit our 2030 goals. Labour will back the builders not the blockers for energy security, cheaper bills and good jobs.\nYou can find a clip of my appearance below, and the full show on iPlayer.\nUNRWA\nI am delighted and relieved that after six months, the new Government has finally lifted the suspension on support to the Palestinian relief and works agency UNRWA.\nUNRWA plays a vital role providing food aid, shelter & medical care to the almost 2 million internally displaced Palestinians in Gaza, and I have long been a supporter of its work.\nFollowing allegations that some of its staff had been involved in the appalling 7 October massacre, the previous government suspended funding to the UN agency while an investigation took place. That investigation concluded months ago, yet the UK remained one of only a few countries left to withhold its support. I had been pressing the government to get on with reinstating support for months.\nUNRWA is the only aid agency with the on the ground capacity to deliver the humanitarian support so desperately needed in Gaza. This decision will undoubtedly save lives.\nSpeeding\nAs I said in my update last week, dangerous driving in our area has become a huge safety concern. I’ve been campaigning on this for years, and I have now called for an urgent multi-agency meeting with PCC Simon Foster and Transport Cabinet Member Cllr Majid Mahmood.\nDo read my letter below.\nContacting my office\nNow that I am back with my feet under my desk in Parliament, I want to remind people that if you need any help you can get back in touch using my parliamentary email or through this website. I am no longer using my campaign gmail account now I have been re-elected as your MP.\nHave a lovely weekend.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

While successful bids through the Levelling Up Fund totalled £52.6m, it shows that they have seen a £241.7m real-terms loss for the area since the Government’s levelling up agenda was announced. This compares to research which found that in England, local authority areas were still worse off by approximately £50 million on average after receiving Levelling Up funding.\nCommenting on levelling up policy, Preet Kaur Gill MP said, “While the Government is distracted cleaning up the Prime Minister’s scandals, they aren’t delivering for my constituents in Quinton, Bartley Green, Harborne and Edgbaston. Birmingham City Council has already had £800 million taken from their budget over the last decade from Conservative Governments. Now, Birmingham is £241.7 million worse off since the Government announced their levelling up agenda. That is an atrocious scandal and shows exactly how our city has been the hardest hit by this Conservative Government's policies. Even the Levelling Up Minister, Michael Gove, has said that levelling up by the Tories is rubbish. The lack of any real ambition to tackle huge regional inequality is appalling and residents of Birmingham are due so much more.\n“However, it’s also imperative that the Government stops their agenda for pitting cities across the Midlands and the North against each another. Local authorities shouldn’t be fighting one another for basic funding. Every council should receive the money they need to provide vital services for its citizens. This is what I will continue to fight for on my resident's behalf.”\nNew statistics have shown that even before the pandemic, 12 years of Conservative attacks on public sector organisations and economic mismanagement, have meant that the UK has seen the worst year for the high street on record. 2,700 jobs were lost per week and 16,000 outlets closed for good. Thousands of businesses were forced to close including:\n9,775 shops\n5,785 pubs\n7,400 bank branches\n1,195 libraries\nGill continued, “I have always backed local businesses as I want to see our high streets flourish. That’s why as a proud Labour and Co-operative MP, I supported the Co-op's ‘Unlock the High Street’ Campaign and at a local level launched my own ‘Save our Banks’ campaign which has seen local communities able to retain their local branches and remaining open to thousands of people who still rely on having access to cash. For me, Levelling Up has to put people at the heart of plans which gives real powers to communities to shape their own futures.”\nLabour has ambitious plans to Make, Buy and Sell in Britain, providing funding for 100,000 new start-up businesses as well as investing in jobs and industries of the future throughout the UK.\nLabour’s Levelling Up five tests for the Government’s Levelling Up plan include:\nGood jobs in all of our cities, so young people have choices and chances and don’t have to get out to get on.\nOur high streets are thriving because the local economy is thriving, with good local businesses and money in people’s pockets - not just papering over the cracks.\nOur towns and villages are better connected to jobs, opportunities, our family and our friends through good transport, digital infrastructure and affordable housing that we have too often missed out on.\nWe get the power to take local decisions for ourselves – ending the system where we have to go cap in hand to Westminster to do things we know will work for us.\nOur town centres are safe and welcoming instead of plagued by anti-social behaviour, with criminals being let off and victims let down.”",

Labour will:\nProvide pathways to good prospects for all, with a new growth and skills levy that doubles down on apprenticeship, a proper national skills plan led by a new body Skills England, and getting more people than ever access to quality post-19 training.\nGet children studying creative arts subject or sports until they’re 16.\nDeliver a broader education, introducing a new curriculum which raises the importance of oracy and digital skills.\nEnsure the highest standards in schools, with a reformed Ofsted and recruitment plan to hire more teachers in shortage subjects.\nIntroduce safe-guarding reviews every year.\nIn this country, we promise our children and grandchildren that if you work hard, you’ll be able to get on, no matter what your background. But Britain is currently failing on that promise.\nIt’s not right that one element of a child’s background – how well off their family is – has such a strong impact on the life they can build.

Baton of Hope is a trailblazing mental health movement that is set to be the UK’s biggest suicide awareness and prevention campaign.\nSuicide is the silent epidemic. Deaths from suicides have been rising since 2008, and tragically reached a record high in England and Wales last year. This is personal to me. I have witnessed the devastating impact that suicide has had on families, friends, and communities.\nTogether, we can build a future where suicide is not an option, where support is readily available, and where hope reigns supreme. Because every life is precious, and every life is worth saving.\nSchool visit\nThis week, I met students from Four Dwellings Primary Academy and St George’s School.\nIt was great to meet Four Dwellings on their visit and tour of the House of Commons.

They’re looking for feedback from communities across five areas – prevention, protection, response, people and sustainability – so do get in touch.\nWest Midlands Police officers have been putting on a variety of activities as part of Anti-Social Behaviour Awareness Week, including off road bike operations, multi-agency operations in areas where anti-social behaviour is a problem, and supporting their partners with area cleanups. Their Safe Haven teams who support and mentor young people with football and sports activities have also been hosting events this week.\nNext week is loneliness awareness week, and ahead of then, Age UK has shared some resources to help constituents who might be suffering with loneliness. Click below to see their helpful written guide for those struggling.\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Wyndham Road, B16 9AF, on Tuesday 11th July. It will be there between 07:00 and 12:30, so please come along if you have rubbish to dispose of.\nNext Saturday, a Community Fun Day will be taking place at St Germain’s Church, B17 8LE, to remember 75 years of Windrush. There’ll be a poetry, music, Zumba, face painting, an exhibition, games, a bouncy castle and much more!\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

This comes in the wake of close to £1 billion in combined cuts from the Conservative Government to West Midlands Police and Birmingham City Council.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said, “Over the last ten years, we’ve seen huge cuts to our public services by this Government. But, all of these cuts have consequences. You simply can’t take 20,000 Police off our streets, close over 600 Police stations and expect crime not to drastically rise. Looking at current figures, it’s fair to say that under the Conservatives, criminals have never had it so good.\n“Since I was first elected in 2017, I have been campaigning along with local residents for more Police officers and designated sergeants. I’m thrilled to say, we have been successful and now Quinton will have a new sergeant, separate to Bartley Green. This means each ward will have their own Police Team.\n“Now, I’m working closely with the Police, to lead a project that will help decide where in each ward of our constituency our Police should be based. However, I want your help in making this decision. It’s so important our Police have a visible presence and are accessible to the communities they serve. That’s why I’m carrying out a constituency-wide consultation. Please have your say and tell me what you think.”\nThis follows Labour’s national approach to tackle crime. Labour will increase the police presence in communities with the national rollout of Police Hubs, each with its own Neighbourhood Prevention Team to ensure anti-social behaviour and other crimes in the communities are tackled quickly.\nTo have your say on where the Police should be located in your area, complete the consultation: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqbxrfs7GzByjtdcX5g6HbhTJTT98Nd5_7gzRQk-F3Tih4fA/viewform",

Liz Truss crashed the economy and Rishi Sunak is trashing our economic future.\nDelaying the phase out of petrol and diesel cars will only load more costs onto the British people, who are, thanks to the Tories, enduring the worst cost of living crisis in generations. It will also damage investor confidence in the UK, demonstrated by the furious reaction we’ve from businesses over the last few days.\nIt is now clearer than ever that only Labour can be trusted to tackle the climate crisis and boost the economy.\nLabour’s mission is to make the UK a clean energy superpower. In government, Labour will create jobs, lower bills, deliver energy security for Britain, and combat the climate crisis.\nIn Parliament\nThis week in Parliament, I raised social media’s role in fomenting religious conflicts around the world in a debate on Freedom of Religion and Belief.\n“Sock puppet\" accounts are fake accounts controlled by real users posing as independent people – as opposed to automated bots. Networks of these accounts spread misinformation, intolerance and inflammatory speech. I've seen these accounts target me.\nNetworks of sock puppets have wrecked havoc in zones of conflict. Facebook has been used for the incitation of violence in Tigray and the social media platform fomented the Rohingya genocide and violence in Myanmar. Any area of the media where it is possible to buy political influence and distort debate is a huge concern. Yet, despite efforts to stop it, such speech still thrives on social media today.\nWith persecution and hate rife across the world, we, as parliamentarians, must stand up for human rights. The Government must do more to enforce respect for Freedom of Religion and Belief throughout the world, and most particularly, inside the UK and in partnering nations.\nIn Parliament\nThis week in Parliament, I also made two interventions: one on the financial situation of Birmingham City Council and another on the Government awarding Avanti West Coast a long-term contract.\nWith regards to Birmingham City Council, I asked the Minister what assessment he's made of the financial situation facing local government and the impact of the £1bn the Government has taken from the council. He replied that the overall health of local government and the financial health of local government matters hugely.\nWith regards to Avanti West Coast being awarded a new contact, I asked the Minister to explain when it became Government policy to reward failure.\nAvanti West Coast had the most complaints of any operator and is consistently rated one of the worst performing on the network. Yet, the Government decided to spend £4m of taxpayers’ money on bonuses to company executives.\nThe Minister suggested that we should move away from a situation where we, as politicians, feel like we can micromanage and second-guess decisions made at the operating level. That, to me, sounds like rewarding failure.\nTamworth\nThis week, it was great to spend the day campaigning in Tamworth with our fantastic Labour candidate, Sarah Edwards, alongside Jess Phillips, Lucy Caldicott and many amazing Labour women.\nAfter thirteen years of Tory failure, the people of Tamworth deserve better. Only Labour can provide Tamworth with the fresh start it deserves.\nNorth West Leicestershire\nLast week, it was great to join Amanda Hack, our brilliant candidate for North West Leicestershire, for her fundraiser.\nIt’s always a pleasure to see so many Labour friends out in support, and I had a fantastic evening. I am very grateful to have been invited to speak.\nLocal News\nGreat British Insulation Scheme\nThis week, the Great British Insulation Scheme has launched.

New analysis of the Government’s latest crime statistics shows that 90% of crimes go unsolved.\nThe figures reveal that almost 70,000 fewer crimes were charged last year overall than in 2019. It’s also the case that record high numbers of crimes are being dropped without a suspect even being identified – 2.3 million crimes were dropped with no suspect being found, up almost 500,000 on 2021.\nAfter 13 years of Tory chaos, victims are being let down. Everyone has a right to feel safe and secure in their homes and communities.\nLabour will make Britain’s streets safe. We will:\nRestore neighbourhood policing\nRecruit youth mentors for young people\nIntroduce specialist rape and sexual assault units in every police force\nPunish antisocial behaviour offenders with tougher sentences and make fly-tippers join clean-up teams\nPrevent crime by putting 13,000 extra police and PCSOs on our streets\nBBC Radio World Service\nThis week on BBC Radio World Service, I commented on Canada’s decision to withdraw its bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2026 for financial reasons.\nThe benefits that come with hosting the Games are widespread. Research suggests that the Commonwealth Games contributed at least £870m to the UK economy, including £453.7m in the West Midlands. The Games also attracted a record 141.2m visitors to the West Midlands last year.\nWhile putting on such a major event clearly comes with a price tag, Birmingham’s record shows that it’s possible to deliver a cost-effective and financially rewarding Games. The city made great use of the resources it had and benefitted from substantial collaboration between local government, national government and the Commonwealth Games team.\nPrimarily, though, hosting the Games is about taking sport to new places, particularly to areas that haven’t had access to it before; it’s about bringing together our diverse communities around sport, and celebrating values of peace, tolerance, and solidarity.\nHosting the Commonwealth Games was one of life’s highlights. I really hope that a solution can be found now that both Alberta and Victoria have withdrawn their commitments to put on the Games and I look forward to the next even wherever it takes place.\nInternational Development\nThis week, the International Development Committee published the damning FCDO Equalities Impact Assessment that was presented to Ministers earlier this year. The report, which reveals the impact of cuts to the overseas aid budget, shows that it is the world's most vulnerable people who continue to pay the price for the Conservatives' political choice to cut the foreign aid budget and divert much of what remains to the Home Office's refugee costs.\n3,000 children in South Sudan will now likely die from acute malnutrition. 200,000 women will now miss out on safe abortions. Women and girls in Afghanistan will be left without basic healthcare. These are not just numbers - they are real people whose lives will be forever changed. If they wait another year just for the Conservatives to get their act in order, help will come too late.\nThe Chancellor and Foreign Secretary must urgently get a grip on the diversion of Britain's aid budget, stand up to the Home Office's misuse of public finances, and return Britain to spending taxpayer money where it can do the most good.\nOnly a Labour government can be trusted to spend Britain's aid budget effectively and restore Britain's global leadership on international development.\n75 Years; 75 Women; 75 Words\nThis week, it was an honour to be included in the launch of the amazing book “75 Years; 75 Women; 75 Words”, led by the British Deputy High Commissioner Chandigarh Caroline Rowett. The project marks 75 years of India’s independence, spotlighting 75 female role models.\nMy grandfather and great grandfather fought for the British in the First and Second World Wars and following this, my parents migrated from Punjab to the UK in the 1950s.\nSikhs have made a huge contribution to Indian and British history. One of my greatest inspirations is the eminent women's rights activist Sophia Duleep Singh, whose grandfather was the great ruler of Punjab, Maharajah Ranjit Singh. Her legacy inspired me to become the first female Sikh MP elected to UK Parliament.\nLocal News\nFOI\nThis week, I’ve been pleased to share that after submitting an FOI with West Midlands Police, the force has improved its 101 response time and Live Chat service.\nThe police have told me that the response time to 101 calls has seen a drastic improvement, falling from nearly 30 minutes to between 3-5 consistently within the last few months. Abandonments, they say, have reduced significantly as well.\nWest Midlands Police have also developed a “detailed improvement plan”, which they’re confident will move West Midlands Police to being “one of the top performing police forces in the UK at managing call demand.”\nI’m pleased to see the police acting on residents' concerns and working to improve their 101 response time and Live Chat service. I will continue to work with the police to make sure that these changes are implemented.\nSpeeding\nThis week, West Midlands Police pledged to expand the coverage of averaging speed cameras to tackle speeding and dangerous driving and have stated that this will be their main area of focus moving forward.\nFor years, I have been campaigning for the installation of averaging cameras. While I welcome the police making road safety a priority, there is still work to be done to ensure that cameras are rolled out properly and effectively.\nI know that for so many of my constituents, reckless driving is a major concern. I will always fight to make our roads safer.\nTransport\nThis week, Transport for West Midlands launched their new e-scooter hire scheme. The first phase will see 200 e-scooters made available to hire in the city centre and surrounding neighbourhoods with a further 700 to be rolled out by end of next month.\nTo protect the safety of both pedestrians and users, riders must be aged over 18 and have a valid UK Driving License. The e-scooters can be used on roads, cycle lanes, carriageways and other areas where cycling is permitted but not on pavements.\nMHRC\nThis week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Harts Green Road, Harborne, B17 9YT, on Friday 11th August. The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so please come along if you're local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_preet-kaur-gill-my-weekly-update-25-april/content_33.html": "Preet Kaur Gill - My Weekly Update - 25 April\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Apr 25\n- 8 min read\nSupreme Court\nThis week, the Education Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities Bridget Phillipson made a statement in the House of Commons about the Supreme Court ruling in the case of For Women Scotland Ltd Vs The Scottish Ministers.\nIn 2018 Scottish Ministers issued guidance on the definition of a woman in the eyes of the Gender Representation on Public Boards Act. That guidance stated that a woman in the Act bears the same meaning as a woman in the Equality Act 2010 – and included trans women with a Gender Recognition Certificate.\nFor Women Scotland challenged this guidance, saying that “sex” in the Equality Act means biological sex, so that a trans woman with a Gender Recognition Certificate is a man for the purposes of that Act.\nThe case was appealed to the Supreme Court, on 16th April the Court ruled that “sex” in the Equality Act means “biological sex”. This means that a person will be considered as their biological sex for the purposes of the Equality Act, regardless of whether or not they have a Gender Recognition Certificate.\nThere’s now a need to ensure that this ruling is clear across a range of settings – from healthcare and prisons, to sport and single sex support groups. The Equality and Human Rights Commission, as Britain’s equalities regulator, is working quickly to issue an updated statutory Code of Practice to reflect this judgement.\nI attended the statement in the Commons welcoming the ruling in the judgement. This was an important judgement that brings clarity to the law, making it easier for employers, service providers and others to understand their responsibilities and avoid breaking the law.\nWhile the Supreme Court was clear about the importance of biological sex, it also stressed that trans people do retain clear protections in law and should be able to live their lives free from harassment and discrimination.\nWe need a society that treats everyone with respect. I am committed to protecting trans people through a full trans inclusive ban on conversion practice and work to equalise all existing strands of hate crime.\nYou can watch my intervention here:\nBreakfast Clubs\nWith students from St Patrick and St Edmunds who have an award-winning breakfast club\nThis week, the first of Labour’s free breakfast clubs opened across the UK. This will make a huge difference for families and their children in Birmingham, Edgbaston.\nOur clubs will improve children’s attendance, attainment, readiness to learn, wellbeing and behaviour, and give parents more flexibility to work and more money in their pockets – up to £8,000 a year. Read more here.\nPolice Accountability\nWith West Midlands Police\nWe have announced new rules that police who fail a vetting check will face automatic dismissal.\nIn recent years, serious cases which have badly failed all proper policing standards have damaged public trust in the officers who are supposed to protect them, and undermined the majority of brave, committed officers who work tirelessly to keep us safe.\nLabour is restoring confidence in policing by making sure only officers of the highest standards are allowed to serve our communities to help keep us safe. Read more here.\nEU\nThe Government has now set out how we are negotiating a new partnership with the EU – with ruthless pragmatism.\nThe benefits of negotiating a new partnership with the EU are clear – reducing barriers to trade, driving economic growth and keeping us safe in an increasingly dangerous world. Pursuing a new partnership with the EU is about meeting the needs of our times. This is not about ideology or returning to the divisions of the past, but about ruthless pragmatism and what works in the national interest.\nOur Labour government is determined to work with our allies in the EU to make the continent safer, more secure and more prosperous. This week, Keir Starmer hosted Ursula von der Leyen at Downing Street to discuss how countries can work together to deliver energy security, as well as the progress made strengthening the UK-EU relationship. We are working with the EU to support Ukraine and to tackle cross-border crime to keep us safer at home. The EU is our largest trading partner, so we are working to reduce barriers to trade across the economy to help drive growth. Read more here.\nBusiness\nWith Chancellor Rachel Reeves\nOur Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled plans to maintain a level playing field for British businesses. She has announced that British businesses will be supported to trade freely acting on practices that undercut fair trade, such as the dumping of cheap goods in the UK. This will help to support many British businesses that operate on our high streets, such as Sainsbury's and Next, who have been undercut by foreign companies.\nThe government has announced immediate action by the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA), the body responsible for defending the UK against certain unfair international trade practices. The Chancellor also announced her intention to review the customs treatment of Low Value Imports, which allows goods valued at £135 or less to be imported without paying customs duty. Read more here.\nWater\nThis Labour government is cleaning up our rivers, lakes and seas. New powers have come into force meaning that water executives who cover up illegal sewage spills could face up to two years in prison – the toughest ever measures in history.\nThis landmark legislation will also see new powers to ban the payment of unfair bonuses for polluting water bosses. This comes alongside £104 billion of private sector investment to rebuild and upgrade our water system, and an Independent Commission into the water sector – the largest review since privatisation. Read more here.\nGreat British Energy Bill\nAn amendment has been tabled to the Great British Energy Bill that will enable the company to act to ensure forced labour is not taking place in its business or supply chains. As well as this, Great British Energy will appoint a senior leader with responsibility for ethical supply chains and modern slavery. Read more here.\nMental Health Bill\nOutside Queen Elizabeth Hospital\nThe Mental Health Bill has been transferred to the House of Commons.\nThe Mental Health Bill delivers the Government’s manifesto commitment to modernise legislation to give patients with severe mental illness greater choice, autonomy, enhanced rights and support, and ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect throughout their care and treatment.\nThe Bill also includes measures to improve the care and support of people with a learning disability and autistic people, reducing reliance on hospital-based care. These reforms to the Mental Health Act 1983 are long overdue. Many of the processes in the Act are out of step with a modern mental health system, whilst the Mental Health Act will continue to play its vital role in keeping people safe. I look forward to hearing from constituents on the Mental Health Bill. Read more here.\nRetirement Savings Boost\nThe Government has unveiled reforms to combine small pension pots to make working people better off, which will boost retirement savings for the average worker by around £1000.\nThere are now 13 million of the small pots, holding £1000 or less. This is a hassle for savers and can stop them getting a good return on their savings if they have to pay multiple flat rate charges. Merging these small pots will also save the pensions industry around £225 million in unnecessary admin costs. Read more here.\nCare in the Community\nWith a local pharmacy in the constituency\nThis week in Parliament, we reaffirmed Labour’s plan to rescue NHS dentistry. We’re rolling out 700,000 extra urgent NHS dental appointments and introducing a supervised toothbrushing scheme to prevent tooth decay that will reach up to 600,000 children in the most deprived areas.\nWe have also recruited over 1,500 GPs as part of our plan to bring back the family doctor and end the 8am scramble.\nCommunity pharmacies play a vital role in delivering patient services.\nThis government has brought in a record investment in community pharmacies, including making the morning-after pill available free of charge and more funding for medicine supply. Read more here.\nMilitary Homes\nWith local housing providers Midland Heart\nOur Armed Forces serve with extraordinary dedication and courage to keep us safe. It is only right that they and their families live in the homes they deserve.\nThat’s why our Labour government is providing military families in my constituency, and 2528 families in the West Midlands, with homes fit for heroes. New measures for forces families, include higher move-in standards, more reliable repairs, renovation of the worst homes, and a named housing officer for every family. Read more here.\nOnline Safety Act\nWith local primary school children\nNew laws published yesterday under the Online Safety Act, coming into force in July, mean that social media and tech companies must implement strong age assurance and protection methods to help shield children from harmful content.\nThis should be a watershed moment, prioritising children’s safety by law. Read more here.\nWomen’s Institute\nAt the WI Parliamentary Event\nI’d like to thank the Women’s Institute for sharing their report on the hidden experiences of women who are often the designated primary caregivers for their families and yet are left battling access to dental care.\nMultiple Sclerosis\nAt the MS Society Parliamentary Event\nThis week, I attended the MS Society’s Parliamentary Event, where I had the chance to meet and hear from people with multiple sclerosis.\nMS is a neurological condition that affects over 150,000 people in the UK and many of my constituents. I want to thank all those that wrote to me asking me to attend this important event.\nPope Francis\nHis Holiness Pope Francis\nI joined millions across the world grieving the death of His Holiness Pope Francis. Pope Francis’ closeness to those suffering and his advocacy for an end to global violence were always a priority. His determination to visibly live out his faith inspired people across the world to see afresh the church’s teachings of mercy and charity. My thoughts are with Catholics across the world.\nLocal News\nBirmingham Bin Strike\nIntervening in the Minister's statement on Birmingham's bin strikes\nIn Parliament, I put on record my thanks to everyone involved in the clean-up of Birmingham, including many volunteers. I asked the Minister if he agreed with me that the council must resolve equal pay issues, which is precisely what the deal on offer will do. Thank you to constituents who have been in touch.\nDriving Tests\nMy Parliamentary Question on driving tests\nIn March, I asked a Parliamentary Question about the wait times for driving tests in my constituency and was shocked to find that Birmingham was one of the worst in the country, with learners waiting 24 weeks for a test. Under the previous Conservative government, waiting times at some test centres in Birmingham quadrupled.\nTo open up more tests and break down barriers to opportunity, I welcome the news announced by the Government this week. This will mean:\n• Those in other DVSA roles who are qualified to examine will be asked to return to the frontline to provide practical driving tests\n• Doubling the number of permanent trainers to skill up new driving examiners quickly\n• Accelerated consultation to investigate the potential abuse of the driving test booking system and prevent bots from accessing tests\n• Reintroduction of overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests\nRead more here.\nFree Travel Scheme\nIt’s great news that five million extra bus journeys have been taken since our Labour Mayor Richard Parker took office, thanks to a landmark free travel scheme to get more people to try the bus.\nAmong those to have benefitted from free travel are hospital staff, care leavers, apprentices and charities. A free evening travel offer was also used to support the region’s nighttime economy in the run up to Christmas.\nGetting more people onto our bus network means we can cut traffic congestion and deliver cleaner air for our region. That’s why Labour is working to make our region’s buses more affordable and work better for local people.\nStreet Surgery\nIt was great to be out talking to residents at my regular street surgery. Today, I visited York Road in North Edgbaston to hear about the issues that matter most to my constituents.\nSt George’s Day\nThis week, we celebrated St George’s Day – this was a time to come together and celebrate our pride in England’s shared history, inheritance and values.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

Baton of Hope is a trailblazing mental health movement that is set to be the UK’s biggest suicide awareness and prevention campaign. An event was also held at MAC Theatre in Edgbaston, gathering leaders, key figures, charities and organisations to reshape the national conversation around suicide.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP, who opened the event with a poignant speech, said: “Suicide is the silent epidemic. Deaths from suicides have been rising since 2008, and tragically reached a record high in England and Wales last year.\n“This is personal to me. I have witnessed the devastating impact that suicide has had on families, friends, and communities. The stories of loss and despair are etched in my heart, and they fuel my determination to bring about change.\n“The Baton of Hope symbolizes the resilience, determination, and unity that will guide us on this journey. As it makes its way through our towns and cities, it will ignite conversations, inspire action, and provide a beacon of hope to those who are struggling.\n“Together, we can build a future where suicide is not an option, where support is readily available, and where hope reigns supreme. Because every life is precious, and every life is worth saving.”\nThe baton is currently on a two-week tour of Britain’s major towns and cities, raising the profile of this issue like never before. The movement aims to boost the national conversation to eliminate the stigma around mental health and to summarise key suicide prevention steps that can be taken by institutions, businesses, public agencies, communities and organisations. They will challenge the Government and public institutions to aim higher on suicide prevention by connecting and collaborating with people and organisations already working to save lives.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP is a long-time advocate for mental health issues: she used her maiden speech in Parliament to pledge to fight the stigma surrounding mental health, launched a campaign with young people in Birmingham about the issue and is currently working with the Edgbaston Youth Council, who have raised mental health as a major concern.",

In 2021, she organised a meeting with the police, council and nightclub bosses to agree on actions to take to keep women safe.\nSeveral reforms seek to tackle the rise of stalking specifically, which has increased by 10 % over the past year. In the West Midlands Police Force Area, over 37,127 stalking and harassment offences were recorded by the police.\nNot knowing the identity of an online stalker can be extremely unsettling with victims left in the dark as to whether the offender is known to them, which can put them in more danger.\nNew ‘Right to Know’ guidance will be brought into force, empowering the police to release the identity of an online stalker at the earliest opportunity. This will provide victims who are subject to this chilling crime with greater reassurance that they will be quickly told the identity of the individual threatening them online.\nStalking Protection Orders (SPOs) can also ban stalkers from going within a certain distance of their victims or contacting them and can also compel them to attend a perpetrator programme to address the root causes of their behaviour.\nCurrently, however, these can only be applied when an offender is convicted and when a protection order was in place before they went on trial.\nA BBC investigation earlier this year found that since SPOs were introduced back in 2020, just 1,439 had been issued by the 40 police forces. This is despite over 440,000 offences being recorded by the police over the same period.\nUnder Labour’s new measures, courts will be able to directly apply protection orders on those who have been acquitted if there is enough evidence to suggest that they are still a risk to the victim.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said:\n“This Labour government is expanding support for victims of stalking and spiking in the West Midlands. Victims show tremendous courage to come forward and seek help. Our new orders will make that as straightforward as possible.\n“Labour is committed to halving violence against women and girls in a decade, and today we are beginning our work to make good on that promise.\n“For too long governments have treated violence against women and girls as an inevitability instead of the emergency that it is. This government speaks with a single voice: on our watch victims will receive the vital protections they so desperately deserve”.\nENDS\nNotes to editors\n• Crime statistics broken down by police force area are provided by the ONS and can be accessed here - Crime in England and Wales: Police Force Area data tables - Office for National Statistics.\n• A summary of the number of offences recorded by the police can also be found here - Crime in England and Wales - Office for National Statistics\n• Statistics on the number of SPOs issued by the police provided by the BBC can be found here - Tiny proportion of stalking cases result in protection orders - BBC News",

Its key finding being that Mr Johnson deliberately and repeatedly misled Parliament.\nThis report of course comes just days after Mr Johnson’s resignation honours list was published with honours for those who participated in rule breaking at Downing Street when the rest of us made sacrifices and adhered to Covid rules. Rishi Sunak’s weakness in failing to block these honours is an insult to us all.\nAt a time when the country is continuing to suffer from the effects of the cost-of-living crisis, we have more chaos and infighting from the Conservatives who are once again showing they lack the stability that our country desperately needs.\nI hear weekly from residents across Edgbaston who are struggling with the cost-of-living. They, like me, will be angry that once again the Conservatives are fighting amongst themselves. This energy would be better spent fixing our broken economy, on fixing the NHS or dealing with the asylum backlog.\nWe must end this cycle of managed decline. The people of Edgbaston – of Britain - need reassurance and a strong Government to deliver a prosperous economy. Only Labour can be trusted to deliver the change our country so desperately needs!\nFCDO Orals\nThis week in Parliament, I asked the government how they plan on restoring Britain’s leadership in international development while they continue to slash aid funding.\nRecent figures show that over 29 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan are now experiencing catastrophic hunger levels following a fifth failed rainy season in a row. Oxfam also now estimates that one person is likely to die of hunger every 28 seconds between now and July.\nThe government’s failure to help the poorest people on Earth fight famine is disgraceful. Under the Tories, and after four years of cuts to the aid budget, Britain risks becoming an international embarrassment.\nI am fortunate, as the Labour Party’s shadow minister for International Development, to see day in day out the remarkable difference that international development policies, budgets and programmes can make. As Secretary of State for International Development, I would boost investment to tackle humanitarian crises and restore Britain’s reputation on the world stage.\nInaugural Edgbaston Youth Council meeting\nIt was a real pleasure to hear so many inspirational young voices in politics at the inaugural Edgbaston Youth Council event hosted by George Dixon Academy this week.\nThe Council was set up by Joanna Saeed, a sixth-form student at George Dixon Academy, who spent months working with schools in Edgbaston to bring together active young people in our constituency.\nWhen I asked her about the Council, she said “It was wonderful to see people of all origins and races come together and discover how much we could all relate to one another.”\nIt’s really great to see schools come together to support young people to get involved in their local communities. I look forward to what the future holds for the Youth Council and will continue to support Joanna and the Council representatives as much as I can.\nWomen in Politics school visit\nThis week, I visited students at the University of Birmingham School to talk about my experience as a woman in politics.\nI told them about my journey into the profession, how my father’s selflessness and strong sense of community inspired my career choice, and the joys that come with being elected Britain’s first female Sikh MP.\nI was particularly impressed by the probing and considered questions that the students put to me about political life. It’s very encouraging to meet young people who are interested in politics and keen to get involved in their local communities.\nI look forward to doing more school visits soon.\nLocal News\nMidlands Connect is urging local businesses to share their views on the Midlands Rail Hub, whose proposals could add more than 14 million seats on the rail network each year and provide faster, more frequent, or new rail links for over 30 locations including Birmingham. A business case has been submitted to the Department for Transport to fund the rail improvements. The survey was extended for seven days on 9 June, with responses accepted up until midnight tonight. Please find the survey here.\nThe Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Leigham Drive (B17 8AT) in Quinton on Wednesday 21 June between 07:00 and 12:45. If you are in the area and have bulky household waste to dispose of then please come along.\nThis week, I am sure everyone across Edgbaston will join me in congratulating Woodgate Valley Urban Farm who have secured a £10,000 donation from the Morrisons Foundation to allow them to install a sensory room at the farm; and a £17,000 award from the Asda Foundation to install new ramps, fencing and pathways, to place raised planters around the pathways and to place new signage and learning boards on the site. I hope to visit soon!\nThe Dogs Trust has contacted me this week asking that I circulate advice around caring for dogs during warm weather. High temperatures can be extremely dangerous for dogs who are very susceptible to heat stroke, especially if left in a hot car. As their bodies work differently from humans it is very important for dog owners and members of the public to be able to recognise the signs of distress.\nWalk your dog when it’s cooler; early morning or late evening; ensure your dog has plenty of water and shade all day; and remember, if you can’t hold your hand on tarmac for five seconds, then it’s too hot for your dogs’ paws.\nIf you see a dog in distress in a hot car, call 999.\nSigns of heatstroke in dogs include hot panting, excessive drooling, drowsy and uncoordinated, vomiting, collapsing. If your dog shows any of these sigs, start cooling your dog with tap water (avoiding their face) and contact your vet immediately.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Since 2017, I have helped tens of thousands of people, and I will continue to do so in the new term.\nAlready, in just our first week in office, the new government has hit the ground running in its mission of national renewal.\nAlready:\nWe have lifted the ban on onshore wind power so Britain can get building the renewable energy infrastructure we need.\nWe have brought talented expert ministers into government, such as James Timpson, known for employing and helping to rehabilitate ex-offenders, as our Prisons Minister.\nOur Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, and Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, to set out his call for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza.\nOur Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has announced plans to bring back mandatory housing targets to get Britain building again.\nOur Home Secretary scrapped the Rwanda scheme and set about opening applications for a new Border Security Commander to take down the people smuggling gangs.\nOur Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, has started negotiations with junior doctors to bring an end to the strikes and met with the British Dental Association about reforming the outdated NHS dental contract.\nThis is the difference a Labour government can make. And we’re just getting started.\nSwearing in\nIt was an honour to be sworn in as the MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston. I was born and raised here, so it’s a privilege to serve the wonderful people of this constituency again.\nI will continue to stand up for the issues that matter most to you.\nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham\nI was deeply alarmed to read the latest report into University Hospitals Birmingham Trust by the Royal College of Physicians which revealed major failings in the transfusion group.\nPatient safety should be the top priority for every NHS trust. I’ve been assured that the trust are acting swiftly to improve culture and patient safety. I will hold them to account.\nDangerous driving\nDangerous driving is a serious issue across our constituency.\nJust days ago, a cyclist was killed in Edgbaston.\nTwo weeks ago, a young woman tragically died after beings struck by a car while walking her dog in Quinton.\nIn May a young boy was knocked down on his way to school in Bartley Green.\nAnd on Wednesday night, another serious speeding incident occurred in Harborne.\nThis has got to stop. People deserve to feel safe on our streets.\nI have long campaigned for measures to improve the safety on our roads, and I am urgently seeking a meeting with the Council, the Police and the Crime Commissioner to see what more can be done.\nQuinton Police Station\nAfter years of campaigning, I’m thrilled to announce that Quinton Police Station has reopened as a base for neighbourhood teams. The Quinton station is now back up and running as a fully operational base for 40 officers, after closing in 2019.\nOne of the top issues raised with me during the past election was crime. People deserve to feel safe and secure in their homes and communities, and I know many of you were concerned about the closure of our local police stations.\nAs your MP, I have listened and delivered.\nVolunteers\nI’d like to thank all of the people who campaigned with me over the last six weeks. This result wouldn’t have happened without you.\nThanks to your dedication and hard work, we have been able to deliver the biggest Labour victory Birmingham Edgbaston has ever seen and have helped elect a Labour government.\nI will be out all year round and look forward to seeing you soon.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

Preet Kaur Gill has been working with the police after many residents complained about being unable to get through to law enforcement.\nOn 2 February 2023, Preet Kaur Gill submitted a freedom of information request with West Midlands Police regarding their 101 and Live Chat service. The force revealed the response time to 101 calls has seen a drastic improvement, falling from nearly 30 minutes to between 3-5 consistently within the last few months. Abandonments, they say, have reduced significantly as well.\nIn response to the report’s findings, West Midlands Police have made a wide range of commitments to improve their non-emergency services, including a “detailed improvement plan” for the future, which they are confident will move West Midlands Police to being “one of the top performing police forces in the UK at managing call demand.”\nPreet Kaur Gill said, “For too long, reporting a crime has been an ordeal for my constituents. I’m pleased to see the police acting on residents' concerns and working to improve their 101 response time and Live Chat service.\n“There’s still a long way to go, but the force’s detailed improvement plan to revamp the service is clearly a step in the right direction. I will continue to work with the police to make sure that these changes are implemented.”\nChief Superintendent Ian Parnell, Head of Force Contact, and Chief Superintendent Richard North, Police Commander for Birmingham, said in a joint statement:\n“The Chief Constable has agreed to uplift call handling staff by 66 to 309 which is a very welcome investment. We have recruited half of the additional staff and we should have completed recruitment by end of September 2023.”\nThey also confirmed that the force has invested in a number of technological solutions and reviewed its policies and processes to make the system more efficient.\nRegarding Live Chat, which doesn’t operate 24/7, West Midlands Police reveal they are considering moving to the national online platform called Single Online Home. They say this will offer additional channels and crime types that can be reported online. From April 2023 people have been able report violence against women and girls' offences, missing and sexual offences via the police.uk website nationally.",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_preet-kaur-gill-mp-my-weekly-update-14-march/content_13.html": "Preet Kaur Gill MP - My Weekly Update - 14 March\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Mar 14\n- 7 min read\nA New Deal for Working People\nIn opposition, Labour promised we would introduce a New Deal for Working People in our first 100 days. We did - and this week the Bill passed the House of Commons, delivering on our pro-business, pro-worker, pro-growth agenda.\nThe Employment Rights Bill ensures 1.3 million of the lowest paid people in our country will be eligible for sick pay for the first time, that fire and rehire is prevented and that workplace rights will be properly enforced.\nIt also means people on zero hours contracts will now be able to have a contract that reflects the regular number of hours they work - if that is what they want.\nThe Bill must now pass the Lords, but we are on the way to providing dignity, respect and security for everyone in the workplace. These measures will benefit the whole country, but particularly places like Birmingham.\nI am extremely proud of the role I have been able to play in getting this legislation over the line, as PPS to the Secretary of State.\n· Day one rights\n· Strengthened parental leave\n· Expanded sick pay\n· Fire & rehire and exploitative zero-hours contracts banned\nThe biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation (and the Tories and Reform voted against it).\nWar in Ukraine\nEarlier this week, we saw the welcome news than an agreement had been reached in Jeddah between President Trump and President Zelenskyy.\nThis was an important moment for peace in Ukraine, and as both the Americans and Ukrainians said, put the ball in Russia’s court.\nIt is very disappointing that Moscow has rejected the proposal. I am absolutely clear it is wrong for Russia to try to impose conditions on a ceasefire.\nWe must bring an end to this war in a just and permanent way that allows Ukraine to enjoy its freedom.\nRead the Prime Minister's statement from earlier this week here.\nTaking back our streets\nThis week I voted for the Crime and Policing Bill in Parliament - the biggest package of measures on crime and policing for decades, with 50 new laws to cut crime and make our streets safer.\nAfter 14 years of Tories, we have seen an epidemic of antisocial behaviour, theft and shoplifting across Birmingham. Labour’s comprehensive set of new measures will tackle ASB, shop theft and street crime head on, giving the police and our communities new powers to take back town centres from thugs and thieves.\nThe Bill also includes measures to address the most serious violence and highest-harm offences such as knife crime, violence against women and girls, cybercrime, child sexual abuse, and terrorism.\nMeasures in the Bill will be backed up by the recruitment of 13,000 extra neighbourhood police officers and PCSOs, with a named, contactable officer in every community. Read more about the recent funding uplift for the West Midlands here.\nIsraeli-Palestinian Peace\nThis week I was pleased to take part in a debate on the merits of establishing an international fund for Israeli-Palestinian peace.\nThe last 18 months have been horrific, but with the announcement of a ceasefire earlier this year, there are glimmers of hope that we can bring this appalling conflict to an end. As I said during the debate, out of the rubble, we must vow to create the conditions for peace: a two-state solution, with a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable and independent Palestine.\nI spoke about the UK’s longstanding expertise in peacebuilding, particularly in Northern Ireland, can help us bring about change from the bottom up, as well as through top-down diplomacy.\nWe owe it to the people of Israel and Palestine.\nBacking the builders\nThis week the government also published the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a key part of our plans to unblock growth and build 1.5 million homes to tackle the housing crisis.\nThe Bill will see significant measures introduced to speed up planning decisions to boost housebuilding and remove unnecessary blockers and challenges to the delivery of vital developments like roads, railway lines and windfarms. This will boost economic growth, connectivity and energy security whilst also delivering for the environment.\nReshaping the state\nLabour were elected on a promise of change, and the Prime Minister is delivering just that.\nThis week, he has taken the bold decision to abolish NHS England, the world’s biggest quango, to bring the management of the NHS back under democratic control.\nAs the Prime Minister said in his announcement: “the buck stops with politicians.”\nSince the disastrous Lansley NHS reforms under the Tory-Lib Dem coalition a decade ago, our brilliant NHS staff have been set up to fail by a bureaucratic and fragmented system. It’s time to get more funds back to the frontline.\nDefence Industrial Strategy\nAs part of our recent commitment to increase defence spending, the new government has pledged to publish a Defence Industrial Strategy to help ensure more defence spend is directed to British-based businesses, supporting British jobs.\nAs part of our commitment to raise defence spending to the highest level since the Cold War, the Prime Minister and Defence Secretary have announced that the Ministry of Defence will set new targets to increase the amount of defence spending directed to small and medium-sized businesses.\nThis can only be a good thing for jobs and SMEs in the West Midlands\nNearly 70% of defence spending goes to businesses outside London and the South East, bolstering local economies, with £1.6 billion spent in the West Midlands last year. Defence small and medium enterprises (SMEs) employ an estimated 17,820 jobs across our region.\nHowever, under the Conservative Government only 4% of direct MOD spending went to SMEs last year – and SME spending was in decline, which is why the Labour Government is stepping up to provide more support to SMEs and help them get their foot in the door in the defence supply chain.\nRead more here.\nFunds for farmers\nThis week it was announced that the government has successfully allocated the sustainable farming incentive budget for 2024.\nThis Government inherited farming schemes which were underspent, meaning millions of pounds were not going to farming businesses. At the budget, the Government proudly secured the largest budget for sustainable food production in our country’s history, with £5 billion was committed in the farming budget over a two-year period.\nAs a result of the Government’s determination to get more farmers to participate, there is now a record 50,000 farm businesses and more than half of all farmed land is now managed under our schemes.\nThe largest of these schemes, SFI, now has more than 37,000 multi-year live agreements and is not only delivering sustainable food production and nature’s recovery for today and the years ahead, but it is also putting money back into farmers’ pockets.\nCommonwealth Day\nOn Monday we celebrated Commonwealth Day.\nThe Commonwealth brings together 56 independent countries, and is home to 2.7 billion citizens.\nBirmingham itself is a Commonwealth city, with citizens whose heritage stretches right across the globe.\nAs Chair of Labour Friends of the Commonwealth, I appreciated the opportunity to celebrate our unity, shared values and our commitment to peace, justice and sustainable development.\nLocal News\nBin strikes\nMy letter to the Council\nThis week I have heard from many residents about the state of waste collection services. Rubbish piling up in the street. Rats. Cockroaches.\nI’m clear that this has become a public health crisis and I share residents’ frustrations about collections.\nThat is why I have written to the Council this week, and am now working with them to find a solution. In the meantime, advice on what to do if you’ve had a missed collection is available here.\nI spoke to the BBC earlier this week. You can read more here.\nRoad Safety\nIn the past year, too many constituents have written to me about road safety, raising issues such as dangerous driving, off-road bikes and potholes.\nThis week I met with the Policy Director of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to discuss how we can improve road safety nationally and here in Birmingham.\nReading for Pleasure\nStudy after study shows how important reading for pleasure is for a child's life chances.\nThat's why I was so pleased to learn that Harborne Academy in our constituency is taking part in the National Reading Champions Quiz, hosted by the Literacy Trust and ALCS. I wrote to wish them the best of luck!\nWest Midlands Multibank\nThis week I also welcomed that a multibank has been launched for the West Midlands.\nThis brilliant initiative, spearheaded by former Labour PM Gordon Brown, has brought together the Birmingham Voluntary Sector Council (BVSC) and Amazon to collect and distribute donations to families and children in need.\nIt aims to distribute 750,000 goods over the next 12 months to 75,000 families.\nRead more here.\nLocal Iftar\nAmidst a busy week, it was lovely to take some time out to join an Iftar along with the West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker, hosted by my constituent Mr Ahmed in Edgbaston. Thank you for having us!\nQuinton PACT\nOn 21 March, there is a police and community (PACT) meeting in Quinton between 7pm and 8pm, at St Faith and St Laurence Church, Balden Road and Croftdown Road, B17 8RD. This is a great opportunity to raise any issues you might have with the local police.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

I know the current picture in my constituency, and it is horrifying. People in our society shouldn’t be left to suffer like this and what’s worse is we know that the situation is only going to become more severe.\n“The Government is hammering working families to the point where it’s now expected that one in five people believe they will fall into debt that they cannot repay. Fuel and energy prices are set to continue to rise to the point where it’s no longer a question of simply managing money and tightening their purse strings. I’ve spoken to residents who have told me about some of the really tough decisions that they’re having to make on a daily basis; including deciding who in their families gets to eat that day.\n“I’ve been hearing what financial experts, like Martin Lewis, have been saying on this crisis and it’s clear we need to see urgent intervention from Government. With energy prices rising by 54% in a few weeks and it is likely we’ll see bills increase by a further 25% in October. Government must take action. It simply isn’t good enough to force the country to take a £200 loan from them as it won’t solve the issue.\n“Labour has an energy security plan that will use a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut 9 million household energy costs by up to £600, and £200 for everyone else (not on a loaned basis). Then as part of its longer-term strategy, Labour will improve the energy efficiency of 19 million homes over a decade would cut UK gas imports by 15% and save up to £400 off the average energy bill for families. We would also invest in longer term nuclear energy and offshore wind.”",

Whilst it is concerning to hear that residents wanted more time to discuss and consider options, I do appreciate the limited timescale which allows for planting. I am pleased to see the mixed planting, particularly with trees which will reach greater heights and therefore start to screen some of the M5. However, can you please confirm that residents were warned of the final decision before action was taken? This is a crucial point given that little to no warning was given of the trees being removed in the first place.\nIn our last conversation, you said that air quality monitoring would take place as well as noise assessments. Can you please confirm whether this has yet happened, and could you please provide my office with a copy of any results? If it has not yet taken place, can I ask for the date it will occur and for this to be given greater expediency?\nIn terms of compensation, I have had several residents contacting me to tell me of the difficulties they are experiencing in trying to organise compensation. I understand some houses are more affected than others however, can we please have a conversation to understand what compensation will be offered and what criteria this is based on? Several residents have had their properties either devalued since the trees were felled or had house sales fall through. As a public-funded agency, it is important that the process compensation is as clear and transparent as possible.\nWhen we spoke recently, you stated that an assessment would be undertaken regarding the acoustic fence. Has this been completed? I understand that in a letter to residents you stated that the cost would be £2-3 million and so would likely not go ahead. I find it concerning that this information was not relayed to me when we spoke. I have since enquired about acoustic fence costs. My estimates are between £300-£500,000. Can you please confirm costings on this? I would be happy to put you in contact with the companies I have spoken to so that this work can be completed as urgently as possible.\nI appreciate that Highways England has many responsibilities however, my constituents are living next to this on a 24/7 basis, and I am concerned for their mental health. Therefore, can I please ask that this is looked at urgently.\nYours sincerely,\nPreet Kaur Gill Member of Parliament for Birmingham, Edgbaston",

On average, it will mean that schools will have £168 less to spend per child on students' education in the school year for 2023/2024.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said: “Schools are already suffering because of the failure of the Conservatives to meet their manifesto pledge to invest in education. For example, Woodgate Primary School in Bartley Green will lose £231, 901 from their budget next year. That’s an enormous £3,514 loss per pupil. Warnings from head teachers are becoming more and more frequent and with the Conservatives crashing the economy, this is only set to worsen.”\nA recent survey by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) found that 66% of 11,000 school leaders will have to make teaching assistants redundant or reduce their hours, while 50% are looking at cutting the number of teachers or teaching hours.\nPreet continued: “I recently met with headteachers across my constituency, and they told me in no uncertain terms how existing budgets simply aren’t meeting the educational needs of pupils. With the cost-of-living crisis hitting families hard, it is falling to schools that are desperately having to make up the shortfalls as best they can. What is clear, hungry children don’t learn.\n“We need a government that can think creatively, support our schools and parents, and put in place the necessary measures that are so urgently needed. For instance, Labour will deliver breakfast clubs for every primary age child in England saving parents thousands in childcare costs and saving money for schools in the process.”",

Since being elected I have voted more than 745 times, asked 1,700 parliamentary questions and spoken in over 200 debates. Time and again, I’ve worked hard to represent local residents on the issues that matter most to them.\n\"During the pandemic, casework soared with so many people writing to me and calling to ask for help. Over the last four years, I’ve supported more than 31,000 people with a range of issues. I am particularly proud to have been named the Patchwork Foundation’s MP of the year in 2020 which recognised the work I have done in creating a mentoring programme for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and advancing the concerns of minority groups.\n“But it is the successes I’ve had with local campaigns that brings me the greatest pride. Alongside Labour supporters and local residents, we protested to keep our banks open on Harborne High Street. I have worked with the police on Saif Lodge, to ensure that the first example in the country of substandard exempt accommodation was permanently closed. I’ve also worked hard in Birmingham to ensure we improve the state of our roads. Now that the council has put an end to the disastrous Tory PFI contract with Amey, I have worked with our excellent Labour councillors to see that Edgbaston constituency gets a considerable proportion of the £100 million investment to repair and resurface our roads.\n“But there is so much more for me to do for communities across our constituency. I will continue to work tirelessly to represent the interests of everyone and look forward to contesting the next General Election as Labour’s candidate”.",

This powerful new legislation will give law enforcement tougher tools to pursue people smugglers and disrupt their ability to carry out small boat crossings.\nThe new Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill will include laws allowing immigration officers and police to seize phones, laptops and other electronic devices at an earlier stage before arrests are made and create a new offence for collecting information to be used by organised immigration criminals to prepare for boat crossing.\nTo prevent more people being crammed into unsafe, flimsy boats and lives being put at risk by these gangs, we will also make it an offence to endanger another life during perilous sea crossing to the UK. Find out more here.\n3D Guns\nSpeaking to Times Radio about 3D-printed guns\nIt’s great that the Government has responded to my campaign and is making it illegal to possess the templates for 3D-printed firearms.\nThe Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill will criminalise the making, adapting, importing and possession of specific articles that could be used in serious crime, including templates for 3D printed firearms, carrying a prison sentence of up to 5 years.\nLast year I presented the Firearms (3D Printing) Bill to Parliament, to shut down a loophole that means it is legal to possess or share a blueprint to make 3D-printed guns, or part-make a 3D-printed gun.\nAs organised crime changes, legislation must keep up. Templates to make untraceable lethal weapons can now be shared and downloaded easily via social media, and with hostile actors using social media and other platforms to stir and incite violence on Britain’s streets, it is imperative we act. Since 2021, the National Crime Agency has reported a 733% rise in the number of cases involving the seizure of 3D printed firearms and components during targeted police searches.\nI’m looking forward to working with the Government on this legislation as it progresses through Parliament. Read more here.\nIntegrated Funding Settlement\nThe Government has announced that the West Midlands will get £385m to drive local growth and unlock regional control of key services including transport, house building and employment support in a new integrated funding settlement.\nThis is the first time in English history that mayors will get real control over their budgets, which will better equip them to act on local priorities.\nI’m looking forward to working with the Mayor on the delivery of local projects to ensure that my constituents in Birmingham, Edgbaston benefit from this new settlement. Read more here.\nGrowth\nThis week, the Chancellor vowed to go further and faster to kickstart economic growth across the country, including in the West Midlands.\nOur region will gain from new strategic partnerships trialled by the National Wealth Fund. The Government’s National Wealth Fund and Office of Investment will work with local leaders to build pipelines of investment and projects linked to regional growth priorities.\nThe Chancellor has reiterated how residents in the West Midlands are set to benefit from sweeping reforms under the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which will take an axe to red tape that slows down approval of infrastructure projects and ensure a smooth and speedy delivery.\nThe Government has also agreed for water companies to unlock £7.9bn investment for the next 5 years to improve our water infrastructure and provide a foundation for growth. This includes nine new reservoirs, one of which is in the West Midlands. The last major reservoir built in the UK was completed in 1992.\nIn her speech this week, the Chancellor also unveiled plans to unleash the potential of the Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor that will add up to £78 billion to the UK economy according to industry experts, catalysing growth of UK science and technology.\nShe has backed the redevelopment of Old Trafford and will review the Green Book - the government’s guidance on appraisal - in order to support decisions on public investment across the country, including outside London and the Southeast.\nYou can read the Chancellor’s full speech here.\nNHS\nThis week, the Health Secretary stated that we are instructing the NHS to go back to basics, fix the fundamentals, and focus on the things that matter most to patients: cutting waiting times for operations, A&E and ambulances, making it easier to see a GP or a dentist, and improving the mental health of the nation.\nThe Government has provided significant extra investment and given clear directions to trusts on what it expects. The Department will reward high performance and drive up standards as we deliver on our Plan for Change and build a health service fit for the future. Read more here.\nGambling\nProblem gambling can be devastating for those whose lives it touches, and unfortunately, those numbers are on the rise with NHS Services treating record numbers.\nThe Government’s has introduced a statutory levy on gambling operators, generating £100 million for the research, prevention, and treatment of gambling harms. Read more here.\nElmhurst Ballet School\nWith students from Elmhurst Ballet School\nI'm very pleased that talented Music and Dance Scheme students from lower income families will not see their school fees rise, after I raised this with Ministers.\nElmhurst Ballet School is a brilliant school educating talented students and a wonderful local asset.\nWhat we've done for you\nOur Labour government has begun our first steps for change, and we are already delivering on promises we made at the General Election. You can find a list of some of the ways that Labour is making working people better off on my website here.\nBBC Politics Midlands\nFrom my appearance on BBC Politics Midlands\nLast Sunday, I appeared on BBC Politics Midlands to talk about knife crime, flytipping and speeding. You can watch the full episode here.\nCo-op Party Energy Roundtable\nIt was great to chair the Co-operative Party community energy roundtable. It was beneficial to meet with local government leaders to talk about how we deliver the local power plan and provide opportunities for community ownership.\nKnife Crime\nKnife crime is a crisis in our communities. In recent years, I have been witness to some horrific cases – in every one, what strikes you immediately is the senselessness of it.\nI welcome the government’s announcement of an extra £48 million in funding for West Midlands Police for 2025-26, equivalent to a 6% boost. These extra resources will help our police force to tackle violent crime in our communities. Read more here.\nAPPG for British Sikhs\nAt APPG for British Sikhs event\nIt was a privilege to attend the APPG for British Sikhs event celebrating the military contribution of Sikhs to the UK. My great grandfather fought in the First World War for the British Army in France.\nThere is also currently an exhibition on at Hampton Court Palace exhibition celebrating many forgotten stories from the Sikh battalions. I would encourage anyone in or travelling to London to visit.\nASDA Drop-in\nAt Asda schools drop-in\nIt was great to attend the ASDA Cashpot for Schools Drop in in Parliament this week. In my constituency, 1,643 customers raised £7,085, which will be donated by Asda to support 24 local primary schools.\nLiver Disease Drop-in\nLiver disease deaths are around five times higher in the most deprived areas of the country.\nI support British Liver Trust’s calls for improvements in early diagnosis and prevention of liver disease and tackling health inequalities.\nHolocaust Memorial Day\nOn Monday, we commemorated 80 years since Auschwitz was liberated, remember the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and those killed in other genocides.\nWe must reject hate, and stand against antisemitism, racism and intolerance for a better future.\nI signed the book of commitment pledging to take action for a better future and lit a candle in my window to remember those who were murdered for who they were.\nYou can read the Prime Minister’s full speech here.\nLocal News\nLeasehold\nHundreds of my constituents have contacted me about the financial mismanagement and poor service they have experienced with FirstPort. I asked FirstPort to look into these issues as a matter of priority to ensure outstanding accounts are dealt with immediately. You can find my full letter here.\nHagley Road Steering group\nMeeting with colleagues to discuss the Hagley Road corridor\nAs Chair of the Hagley Road Steering Group, it was good to meet with colleagues this week to discuss the delivery of the Hagley Road Rapid Transit Scheme.\nThe scheme will maximise accessibility, regeneration, and development of the Hagley Road Corridor. Investing in public transport will mean faster and cheaper journeys to work for my constituents and new connections help to support local growth.\nMeeting with Richard Parker\nWith West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker in Parliament\nIt was great to meet with our West Midlands Mayor, Richard Parker, to discuss regional priorities, such as the Hagley Road corridor, housing development and measures to reduce speeding. I look forward to working together to deliver better transport, more housing and safer streets for my constituents.\nMHWC\nNext Friday, 14th February, the MHWC will be visiting Kelmscott Road in Harborne, B17 8QW. The centre will be open from 7:30am until 1pm, so please do come along if you have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Preet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

In contrast, the Conservatives lost over 1,000 Council seats – a clear rejection of the tired, worn-out, out of touch, and out of ideas Conservative Party.\nAfter thirteen years of divided and weak Conservative government, voters went to the polls concerned about the cost-of-living and breakdown in public services. Reflecting on the fact that too many of us are being held back from working and living our lives to the full, they saw Labour offering the policies the country desperately needs to give Britain back its future.\nIn Edgbaston, residents continue to share with me how the cost of living is impacting them. The economic outlook remains desperate for so many in our constituency and our country. But the Conservatives can never be the solution for Britain when they have created so many of the problems.\nThe Labour Party is listening and focusing on the areas that matter most to voters to build a better Britain!\nCoronation Celebrations\nThe past weekend was one of wonderful celebrations for the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. I recall when I met His Majesty, he spoke about the Sikh contribution to World Wars, and I told him about my Great Grandfather who fought for the British in World War I based in France. This is part of the Commonwealth story – one which all of us, in some way, are a part of.\nOn Sunday, I joined Moor Pool Residents’ Association for the King’s Coronation picnic and bench unveiling. The bench is to honour the reign of our wonderful late Queen Elizabeth II. I wish to give my thanks to the organisers for putting on a brilliant day, and to all who attended.\nLater that day, I attended a Coronation Street Party on Wadhurst Road. There was a great community spirit, plenty of food and activities and thankfully the weather was lovely too!\nI hope everyone across Edgbaston constituency had a similarly joyous Coronation weekend. It would be great to see photos from your own street parties and events.\nCentury Tower Visit\nFor a long time now, I have been supporting residents who live in Century Tower in Edgbaston. They have been raising serious problems around anti-social behaviour and the maintenance and upkeep of the communal areas.\nAfter writing to all residents in Century Tower earlier this year to get a fuller picture, I organised a meeting with Birmingham City Council Housing Officers. We met on-site on Thursday to discuss the issues and agree an action plan to address these matters once and for all.\nResidents deserve to live safely, securely, and peacefully in their homes, and I wish to extend once again my support to residents in Century Tower to seeing through improvements. I also wish to thank Birmingham City Council for attending and for their constructive meeting with me.\nOur constituency is home to many residential blocks, which are often difficult to access during door knocking, campaigning, and leafletting, I am keen to hear from anyone who has concerns about their own apartment block. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.\nLocal News\nOn Friday 5 May, Birmingham City Council began consulting on road safety measures for Metchley Lane in Harborne. This includes the introduction of a 20mph speed limit, installation of two Vehicle Activated Speed Signs, and associated road markings and signage. Residents should have had letters dropped by the Council on this date and the consultation is open until Friday 19 May.\nSimilarly on Friday, the consultation for speed calming measures on Fountain Road closed. The proposed scheme comprises of the construction of traffic speed cushions and associated signage and road markings. I know speeding in this area is a concern and I look forward to receiving updates from the Council in due course.\nOn Thursday, I met with local Inspector Jason Wathes to discuss crime and policing in our constituency. On a weekly basis residents raise crime issues, especially burglaries. Given cuts to funding and decimation of neighbourhood policing, I am fighting for more resources.\nOn Sunday 13 May, from midday, FoodCycle returns to Quinton at Saint Boniface Church, 48 Quinton Road West, Quinton, Birmingham, B32 2QD. All are welcome to enjoy company, conversation, and a free hot meal cooked by fantastic volunteers.\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be returning to the constituency on Thursday 18 May between 7am – 12:45pm at Ravenshurst Road B17 9DP.

IFAD helps rural economies increase agricultural production and build resilience to the effects of climate change. As smallholder farmers provide up to 80% of the food supply across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, they are essential to ensuring global food security. Gill’s meeting with Elba comes at a key time, with Russian attacks on ports and a grain shortage sending food prices soaring and pushing millions of the world’s most vulnerable to the brink of starvation.\nThe Shadow International Development Secretary and Elba have agreed to collaborate on combatting the food crisis, strengthening global cooperation and supporting rural communities in developing countries. They also stand against Russia using food as a weapon in conflict.\nPreet Kaur Gill said: “Sabrina and I have much to collaborate on with regards to international development, climate action and poverty eradication. The humanitarian work she does, especially in ensuring food security through her support for small-scale farmers, is vital and totally inspiring.\n“I look forward to working together to support people in developing countries. Given that Sabrina is an inspiration to so many women around the world, it is amazing that she is using her platform to make the case for international development.”\nSabrina Elba, of Somali descent, and Preet Kaur Gill, Britain’s first female Sikh MP, also commend the diaspora community for the contribution they make to international development. This comes after Labour revealed that it is currently consulting on a family remittances policy to form part of an offer to our diverse communities across the UK.\nThe money sent abroad in the form of remittances plays an important role in tackling poverty in developing countries. In Somalia, The World Bank estimates that remittances account for 21.4% of the nation’s GDP.",

Greater Manchester will benefit from a settlement worth £560 million.\nThe Government is looking forward to providing additional transport funding in the West Midlands next year. The transport settlement for the West Midlands reflects the financial challenges inherited from the previous administration, and the Government remain committed to supporting sustainable improvements in the region’s transport network.\nThis is the first time in English history that mayors will get real control over their budgets. The new Integrated Funding Settlements will be the first of its kind, consolidating funds from multiple Whitehall departments into one pot.\nThis will bring greater flexibility in how it is spent and cut out needless bureaucracy where the mayoral authorities previously had to repeatedly bid for multiple funding pots from individual departments, such as Education and Transport, making sure every penny of taxpayers’ cash is focused on public services. The funding agreement that will give the West Midlands and Greater Manchester mayors more power to direct government funding towards regional priorities.\nThe new flexible funding will help the West Midlands drive forward schemes to help build 20,000 new social homes, growing the Business Growth West Midlands support system for local businesses and developing and training the next generation of low-carbon engineers.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“Our region will benefit greatly from this ambitious funding settlement, which will generate growth, boost housebuilding and improve connectivity.\n\"Our Mayor will now have more control over decision making for our region, enabling him to deliver on the priorities that our communities care about.\n“I’m looking forward to working with the Mayor on the delivery of local projects to ensure that my constituents in Birmingham, Edgbaston benefit from this new settlement.”\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said:\n“Our country and local leaders have been held back for too long by outdated systems and bureaucratic box ticking exercises, stifling growth and ambition.\n“Greater Manchester and the West Midlands will now hold the reins on its own priorities – driving forward meaningful change for working people from building more affordable homes to day-to-day running of busses.\n“This is our devolution revolution in action, and we are bringing forward this more flexible funding for more mayors next year to continue our Plan for Change to spread opportunities and growth to every region.”",

Sikhs and Jews have been legally recognised as ethnic groups for over 40 years since the Mandla v Dowell Lee case in 1983.\nThe Bill would address a fundamental absurdity in the fight against discrimination and inequality, that we do not collect ethnicity data on Sikhs and Jews since laws on racial discrimination were first introduced nearly 60 years ago.\nThe Women and Equalities Select Committee were told in February 2018 that the Government’s Race Disparity Audit had identified around 340 datasets across government, but found no data on Sikhs.\nThe only data collected on Sikhs and Jews in more recent years is religious data. However, the quality of data collected by public bodies on religion compared to ethnicity is poor, patchy and incomplete. Religion data is never used by public bodies to make decisions for the purposes of delivering public services. It makes both Jews and Sikhs invisible to policymakers – therefore ignoring the inequality and discrimination both groups face.\nThat is why a specific Jewish and Sikh ethnic category is needed.\nThat is what this Bill will do.\nMr Speaker, this is a campaign to end the discrimination both communities face.\nI campaigned for a Sikh and Jewish ethnic tick box to be included in the 2021 Census, because we know public bodies have been instructed for over 30 years to use the design of the Census ethnic groups questions to design and deliver services in compliance with equalities legislation.\nAs protected characteristics, you would expect that public bodies are instructed to routinely collect information on Sikhs and Jews. But they are not.\nAs an Equalities Minister wrote to me last year:\n“Public bodies and decision-makers who think that their decisions may affect discrimination, harassment, or victimisation of Sikhs, […] should ensure that their compliance with the duty includes considerations of Sikh ethnicity.”\nBut they don’t, because people incorrectly argue and assume data collected on religion is a suitable substitute. Those people don’t understand the existing practices.\nReligion data is rarely collected to a good standard, it excludes non-practicing Sikhs and Jews, and it is not used by public bodies to monitor and reduce inequalities, or provide public services.\nSikhs and Jews are missing from whole swathes of public data: education; housing; crime; health; criminal justice; the public sector workforce; the ethnicity pay gap.\nThe proposal in this Bill would allow public bodies to start systematically collecting data on Sikhs and Jews to address the discrimination and inequalities they face. Especially as the Government has made a commitment to require ethnicity pay gap reporting.\nIn presenting this Bill today, I have the support of a wide range of community organisations. This includes the Sikh Council UK, 112 UK Gurdwaras and organisations, The Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Antisemitism Policy Trust and the Community Security Trust (CST).\nI would like to provide the House with a few examples of why this Bill is so important.\nThe pandemic shone a harsh light on the inequalities between different ethnic groups.\nMany experts in public health now recognise that we were too slow to recognise that some ethnic groups were dying at a far higher rate than others.\nThe Office of National Statistics (ONS) belatedly started analysing Covid related deaths data by religious group, where data was available – a short-term exercise that has since been discontinued.\nIt found that Sikhs died disproportionately from Covid even after adjusting for region, population density, area deprivation, household composition, socio-economic status, and a range of other economic indicators.\nNot only this, but it showed that Sikhs were affected at a very different rate to other predominantly South Asian groups – meaning that analysis using the existing ethnic minority categories would fail to capture any of these inequalities.\nThe Board of Deputies has also recognised these arguments.\nBritish Jews died at almost twice the rate of the rest of the population.\nWith the higher prevalence of certain genetic conditions among Jewish people, for example breast cancer in Ashkenazi Jewish women, collecting better data will help public services profile and respond to the community better.\nSurely to address health inequalities, we need to learn from the pandemic and collect accurate data to address outcomes for both these communities, given the evidence base?\nTo give just one example, which highlights the absurdity of this system, the NHS Blood and Transplant Authority does not collect data on Sikh organ donors or Sikhs requiring an organ transplant, despite a policy of more than a decade of trying to encourage more Sikhs to become donors!\nThey do not hold the single most important data point that would allow us to improve sign-up rates in this underrepresented group!\nIt’s simply shocking!\nAs Amanda Bowman, Vice-President of the Board of Deputies, wrote last year:\n“Imagine you’re sitting in a hospital waiting room and have been asked to fill out a form which, among other questions, asks for your ethnicity. […] So which box do I tick?”\nAs David Baddiel, the author of Jews Don't Count, has said:\n“It is othering and alienating” that Jews do not have a distinct ethnic box to reflect their race.\nSince October 7th, the British Jewish community have faced an appalling rise in antisemitic hate attacks.\nWhile the Home Office collects data on antisemitic hate crimes by religion, it doesn’t on racially aggravated antisemitism. This is despite racial hate crime outnumbering religiously aggravated hate crime by 10:1.\nThere is therefore a serious risk that Jewish hate crimes are being undercounted by the Home Office, because they do not have their own Jewish ethnic category.\nIn the first half of this year, the Community Security Trust (CST) found that the majority (52%) of antisemitic incidents they recorded consisted of “anti-Jewish discourse linking the victim to Israel, Palestine, the Hamas terror attack or the subsequent war.”\nAccording to CPS prosecution guidance, hate targeting someone’s real or perceived nationality or national origins – such as a link to Israel – would indicate a racially, not religiously, aggravated offence.\nThe same also goes for Sikhs, as has been documented in the APPG on British Sikhs’ report into anti-Sikh hate. Sikhs are the most visible minority in Britain, yet we do not collect data on racist anti-Sikh hate.\nThe last government’s hate crime action plan effectively ignored Sikh hate or the definition of anti-Sikh hate.\nHere in is the fundamental problem with consigning Sikhs and Jews to exercises focused on religion data, and not ethnicity.\nReligion is not a mandatory field in terms of crime reporting standards set by the Home Office for police forces, apart from in religiously aggravated hate crime cases only. However, police forces are required to record ethnicity or EA codes using Census categories, where Sikhs and Jews do not exist despite recognition in Equality Act 2010.\nHis Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services has produced at least 30 different reports since 2017 criticising police forces for the poor recording of data on the ethnicity of victims of crime.\nA final example.\nIn October, the chief executive of UK Jewish Film Festival warned of the “erasure of British-Jewish culture from national cultural life” by arts bodies, which are of course largely publicly funded.\nBenjamin Till, a Bafta-nominated composer, told the Jewish Chronicle that the Arts Council “doesn’t allow Jewish people to identify as anything other than a religion” and insists it “must accept that Jewishness is a cultural, and an ethnic identity.”\nAs the APPG on British Sikhs and Board of Deputies have warned, even on its own merits, using religious questions to capture data on our communities will increasingly become irrelevant.\nThe percentage of Sikhs and Jews who identify with their ethnic group but do not practise their religion is growing.\nAs Britain becomes increasingly secular, we are failing to recognise how British Sikhs and Jews face discrimination in other ways.\nEthnicity data can capture this in ways that religion data doesn’t.\nAs the Board of Deputies has said, “We are concerned that until this situation is rectified, many Jewish citizens will not feel fully counted.”\nAs a former Cabinet Member for Public Health and Protection on Sandwell Council, Sikhs and Jews are forgotten when it comes to the design of services, because there is no ethnicity data on Jews and Sikhs to inform those decisions. Religious data is not used.\nIn the rare cases where we do have some data, it often exposes glaring inequalities.\nIn 2018, 5.3% of homeless deaths in London were Sikh vs 1.3% of the general population in the city.\n27% of Sikhs in the UK report that someone in their family has an alcohol addiction.\nThe pandemic revealed that both Sikh and Jewish people were dying at a significantly greater rate than other groups.\nGood quality data saves lives.\nIn the past few years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has come to acknowledge the need to “ensure the ethnicity standard reflects the diversity of the UK population.”\nThat surely means it is time to address this injustice facing Sikh and Jewish people.\nWhatever the future of ethnicity data collection, we must routinely be included in our own right:\nIf you consider our legal status as ethnic groups: we should be included.\nIf you consider the size of our populations: we should be included.\nIf you consider our contribution to Great Britain and society: we should be included.\nIf you consider the specific forms of discrimination and inequalities we face: we should be included.\nWhat our communities are asking for is fairness and justice:\nTo be counted as ethnic groups given we have been recognised as such in law for over 40 years.\nAs David Baddiel has argued, “identifying antisemitism as religious intolerance, rather than racism, downgrades its importance, which is what leads to Jews not counting.”\nThe same goes for Sikhs.\nAnd this is not just a rhetorical point.\nIt is literally the case that regarding Sikhs and Jews as a religious category means we are not counted.\nWe are not counted when we fill in a form in an NHS waiting room.\nNot counted in the Census.\nAnd local Councils don’t count us in the data they use to monitor and deliver services.\nIt’s high time that changed, and so I urge Members across the House to allow this Bill to progress today.\nIt’s high time that public bodies ended this injustice. As legislators we must put this wrong right and to support them to do that.\nWatch the full speech here: https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/3bd4934f-3cb3-45b3-b6c5-678a2c831723?in=12:36:11",

While the threat of Covid-19 has lessened, we have seen the cost of living crisis push more and more working people into hardship. And, where we may have hoped for support from Government, Conservative political chaos has crashed our economy, making life harder for people in Birmingham.\nAs we approach Christmas and the New Year, this is a moment to take stock of the important things in life and to look out for one another.\nAs ever, it has been a privilege to represent you in Parliament and to fight on your behalf to make Edgbaston constituency a better place to live, work and grow up in.\nSince you elected me, I have voted over 850 times and asked 1,884 questions in Parliament. I have taken on 37,000 new cases on residents’ behalf and resolved almost 35,000 cases. Some of the cases I have worked on this year have included:\nTackling damp and mould in homes and lobbying for properties to be retrofitted;\nWorking with the Police to address concerns with rising crime, particularly around vehicle theft;\nEnsuring people are receiving the benefits they are entitled to for example supporting residents to get backdated claims on their pension credit.\nI’ve joined with local residents and our fantastic local venues to welcome international athletes to Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games.\nI have continued to successfully lobby the council for roads to be resurfaced – our constituency has seen the most funding spent on resurfacing across the city.\nI have worked to improve our health service through supporting residents getting GP and dentist appointments, writing to University Hospitals Birmingham about their waiting lists and, challenging Government on their record of failure in supporting our NHS.\nI’ve continued to work with residents and action groups on exempt accommodation which, causes so much anti-social behaviour and does not always support tenants as it should. I have also provided written evidence to the Housing Select Committee and have led meetings with resident action groups, the social housing regulator and the Minister.\nAs Shadow Cabinet Minister for International Development, I undertook a visit with David Lammy to Afghanistan earlier this year to see for myself what the impact of the withdrawal has been, especially on girls education. I also visited the Polish and Ukrainian border to meet with the Polish government, thank them for the scale of support they are providing to Ukrainian people and to ask what more the British Government can do as an international partner and friend.\nBirmingham MPs on all sides of the political spectrum have set up an All-Party Parliamentary Group for Birmingham. As Chair of this APPG, I have supported the five levelling up bids that were submitted to Government including the bid for Edgbaston. If successful, this will see Quinton Police Station brought back into use as a community hub focusing on youth, early years and training and skills.\nThat’s just a taste of some of the things I have achieved in 2022 and I look forward to continuing to work hard for you in 2023.\nIf you want to learn more about what I've been up to, please make sure you subscribe to my weekly newsletter here.\nIf you need any advice or support, please get in touch on 0121 392 8426 or preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk.

Provided a deal is agreed, the breakthrough this week will be a huge relief for millions who have been through hell over the past 15 months.\nAfter the false dawns of 2024, I am hopeful that we can now finally bring the bloodshed to an end.\nWe need to now see a surge in humanitarian aid and all hostages released. The international community must not rest until we secure a lasting peace, with stability, sovereignty and security for both Israelis and Palestinians at its heart.\nYou can read the Prime Minister’s statement here.\nUkraine\nYesterday, the Prime Minister signed a landmark 100 Year Partnership with Ukraine to deepen security ties and strengthen our partnership for future generations.\nThis deal is not just about the here and now, but about investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come. Find out more here.\nRenters Rights Bill\nSpeaking to ITV about section 21 evictions\nFor too long, private renters in my constituency have had to live day in day out not knowing if they and their families could be uprooted from their homes with little notice and minimal justification. Many have also been expected to find large sums of cash upfront when trying to find somewhere to live, meaning they are pushed into debt or have to go without essential living costs.\nThis week, I voted to end no fault evictions for good and to protect tenants who do not have upfront funds from being blocked from the private rented sector. Find out more about the new protections for tenants introduced in Labour’s Renters Rights Bill here.\nAI Opportunities Action Plan\nKeir Starmer's full speech on AI\nThis week, the Government announced our AI Opportunities Action Plan to make Britain the world leader and driving incredible change in our country.\nArtificial Intelligence will be the centrepiece of this Government’s industrial strategy. We'll create dedicated AI Growth Zones to speed up planning for infrastructure, meaning more jobs and investment in the UK and more money in people’s pockets. Find out more how our plans to turbocharge AI will make people better off here.\nKey recommendations\nCreate AI Growth Zones (AIGZs) - areas with enhanced access to power and streamlined planning approvals, to accelerate the build out of AI infrastructure on UK soil. Growth Zones will pioneer innovative public-private models to deliver secure, dedicated public-sector computing capacity, supporting key national priorities, including to develop one of the UK’s largest AI data centres, beginning with 100MW of capacity and with plans to scale up to 500MW. The first pilot AI Growth Zone will be at Culham, in Oxfordshire, a world-renowned hub for clean energy and fusion research.\nExpand our sovereign compute capacity by at least 20x by 2030 – as compute needs grow such expansion is critical if the UK is to keep pace.\nEstablish an AI Energy Council with industry leaders from the energy and AI sectors, which the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology will co-chair with the Energy Secretary - to provide expert insight on the energy needs of AI and the development of innovative energy solutions.\nLaunch a new dedicated team tasked with strengthening our sovereign AI capabilities by supporting high-potential frontier AI companies in the UK. This team will work across Number 10 and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, partnering with fast-growing firms and leveraging every tool at our disposal to ensure they can access the compute capacity, data, and global talent they need to succeed.\nEarly Years Support\nAs an ex-children's services manager, I'm delighted that families in Birmingham will be able to access early years support such as pregnancy support, infant feeding advice, and parenting classes following a £3.7 m funding boost from the Government.\nThe first two years of a child’s life lay the building blocks for their physical and emotional wellbeing into adulthood. That’s why we are investing in early years, as part of our Plan for Change, to improve access to services in deprived areas to ensure no-one is left behind.\nFind out more about how families in Birmingham will benefit here.\nStatement on Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse\nChild Sexual Exploitation and Abuse are the most despicable, appalling crimes, affecting some of the most vulnerable children and young people in our society.\nAs a former Children Services Manager in Birmingham, I worked at the front line of protecting vulnerable children in our city for many years. I have uncovered abuse cases and even paedophile rings in my line of my work, and I am proud to have played my part in putting child abusers behind bars.\nSome issues should be above party politics, so I am glad that the new Government has committed to pursuing justice for victims and survivors of Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse who have been badly let down for far too long.\nIt is excellent news that Baroness Casey will be taking forward a rapid review into the scale and nature of grooming gangs offences in this country today because we know that official figures will be a significant underestimate given the vast levels of exploitation and abuse that go unreported and unidentified in some of our towns and cities.\nIt's important the systems in place for reporting these crimes command the confidence of victims and survivors, and I hope that politicians on all sides of the aisle will support the significant package of measures announced today.\nAs well as committing national support to local inquiries, the government has announced £10 million funding to pursue justice for victims and survivors, urge police forces to review unsolved and closed cases, empower more victims to be able to request a review of their cases and launch a rapid audit into the scale of grooming gangs announced.\nEconomy\nSpeaking in the Chamber after the Chancellor's statement on her visit to China\nThis week, I spoke in the Commons after the Chancellor’s statement on her visit to China, helping to secure growth for the UK economy.\nWhile Members on the Conservative benches were carping about our Chancellor’s whereabouts, she was having serious discussions with the world's second largest economy and securing access for UK firms. Only Labour is serious about growth.\nUHB\nAsking the Health Secretary about waiting times in the Chamber\nIn my constituency, University Hospitals Birmingham recently had to declare a critical incident due to immense pressure on services. This is very worrying – everyone should be able to access urgent care when they need it.\nIn Parliament, I asked the Health Secretary if he agreed with me that shifting the focus of healthcare from hospital to community would have a consequential impact on the number of people in hospitals.\nSafe Surgery\nMeeting with Professor Dion this week\nIt was fantastic to meet Professor Dion from The National Institute for Health and Care Research Global Health Research Unit on Global Surgery at the University of Birmingham.\nPoor surgical practice leads to more deaths worldwide than tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria combined. Through the 100 4 100 campaign, the university works with 50,000 surgical teams across 120 countries saving thousands of lives worldwide.\nI look forward to working together on sustainability in healthcare.\nSEND\nAt the SEND Access for All Parliamentary event\nIt was great to attend the SEND Access for All event in Parliament this week, hosted by the Thomas Pocklington Club. Theirs is a campaign designed and led by youth champions to improve learning experiences and outcomes for students with SEND. It was wonderful to hear more about how we can improve access for all.\nOpen Doors\nAt the World Watch List launch event in Parliament\nIn Parliament, I attended the Open Doors World Watch List 2025 launch event. Over 300 million Christians face persecution worldwide. It’s vital as Parliamentarians that we speak up and use our voice for those facing persecution simply for practising their religion – a fundamental human right.\nI spoke to Open Doors about the importance of their work – you can read the article here.\n3D Guns\nI was very concerned to discover that a man in the West Midlands attempted to 3D-print a gun at home. This is a very worrying trend that we are seeing replicated across the country.\nI've presented a Bill to Parliament that would make it an offence to download and possess a blue print for making a 3D gun.\nI spoke to the BBC about my Bill – read the article here.\nPotholes\nLabour is serious about fixing our roads. 14 years of Tory decline have left our roads in a disgraceful state, with 100 times more potholes on our roads than craters on the moon.\nI know that potholes are a blight on the lives of drivers in Birmingham. Since being elected, I have worked with countless constituents to get potholes filled and make our roads safer. Please report any potholes to me, by calling 0121 392 8426, between 9am and 5pm, or email preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk.\nLabour is investing in our roads. We will invest £1.6 billion this year to fix millions of potholes, including £8.6 million allocated for the West Midlands. Read more about our plans here.\nPACT meeting\nPreet Kaur Gill with West Midlands Police\nThe next police meeting for Edgbaston and Harborne residents will be held on 23rd January at 6pm at University of Birmingham Old Gym, Ring Road South, B15 2TT Room LG10. Please do come along if you have any issues that you would like to raise with the police.\nSpeeding\nThis week, I wrote to residents on Augustus Road and Gillhurst Road about speeding. As a resident that frequently walks along these roads, I know that there are particular problems in the area, which is why I have been working with the police, council and the community to tackle the issue. For example, I set up a community neighbourhood speed watch to deter dangerous driving in the community.\nIn the coming weeks, I will be joined by officers from Birmingham City Council on Augustus Road and will be raising the concerns residents have shared with me and will be looking for them to introduce better safety measures in the area - the council are currently conducting a road classification review, which is looking to downgrade a number of roads around Harborne and Edgbaston as part of wider plans to direct traffic heading in and out of the city centre away from these areas altogether.\nIf you are concerned about road safety, please contact my office by calling 0121 392 8426, between 9am and 5pm, or email preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk.\nUniversity of Birmingham\nI’d like to wish the University of Birmingham a very happy birthday as it marks 125 years since Queen Victoria granted its Royal Charter. From its wonderful student community, world-class education and research, UOB is a huge asset to our city. Many happy returns!\nMHWC\nOn Monday, 27th January, the MHWC will be visiting Simmons Drive in Quinton, B32 1SL, and on Wednesday, 29th January, Glencoe Road in North Edgbaston, B16 0PB. The centre will be open between 07:30 and 13:00, so please do come along if you have any household waste to dispose of!\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Preet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-19-january/content_332.html": "My Weekly Update - 19 January\n- scarlettreiners8\n- Jan 19, 2024\n- 3 min read\nUpdated: Jan 30, 2024\nThis week, the unworkable Rwanda bill passed its third reading.\nThe Tories are in total chaos about this failing scheme which is costing the British taxpayer £400m, with more promised, despite not a single asylum seeker having been sent to Rwanda. It’s ridiculous that more Home Secretaries than asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda.\nCrazier than that is the fact that the Government has now been forced to admit that it’s “lost contact” with 85 per cent of the 5,000 people earmarked for removal to Rwanda. That's 4,250 people missing – where are they all? They’re certainly not in Rwanda.\nThe Home Office Permanent Secretary says there is no evidence that the Rwanda scheme will work as a deterrent, and the former Home Secretary and former Immigration Minister say that this bill won’t work. Even the Prime Minister himself doesn’t believe in this gimmick. He had to be talked out of scrapping the whole thing. He didn’t think it would work.\nIt’s time the Conservatives admitted that this deal is just a costly and damaging distraction. Only Labour has a serious plan to reform the asylum system:\n1. Crackdown on criminal smuggler gangs, through new Cross-Border Police Unit and deeper security cooperation with Europe\n2. End hotel use, clear the Tory asylum backlog, and speed up returns to safe countries\n3. Reform resettlement routes to stop people being exploited by gangs\n4. New agreement with France and other countries on returns and family reunion\n5. Tackle humanitarian crises at source helping refugees in their region\nYouth Vaping\nThis week, in my role as Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Public Health, I’ve been campaigning for more measures to tackle youth vaping. Since Labour voted on an amendment to the Health and Care Bill to crack down on vapes being marketed to children, the number of 11-17 year olds vaping regularly has more than trebled. That’s over 140,000 British children becoming addicted to nicotine.\nWhat’s shocking is that, due to a legal loophole, vapes marketed at 0% nicotine can be sold to children. Analysis conducted by Inter Scientific of 300 products seized by various trading standards around the country found that 88% were non-compliant with UK regulations - and 35% contained nicotine despite being marketed at 0%.\nLabour is committed to tackling this epidemic in youth vaping. We will crack down on the companies peddling vapes to children and ban the marketing of vapes, regardless of nicotine content, to under-18s.\nI raised these concerns in Parliament:\nAnd I spoke to the The Sun:\nThere is also evidence emerging showing that grooming gangs are using vapes to exploit minors. This is deeply disturbing.\nLabour will introduce tough new laws to stop gangs exploiting children and come down hard on anyone marketing vapes to under-18s.\nI spoke to The Mirror:\nMedical Devices Regulations Debate\nThis week, I spoke in a regulations amendment debate pertaining to In Vitro Diagnostic Devices.\nFrom catching killer diseases early to preventing infections, the medtech companies make a huge contribution to our NHS, and our vibrant life sciences sector in the UK. Labour supports the amendments to secure continuity of supply for the critical medtech sector.\nFuture Advocacy\nThis week, it was great to meet with Future Advocacy to discuss Movember and the important issue of men's mental health.\nAround three quarters of those who take their own lives are men. Labour's mission will be to reverse the number of rising suicides, so fewer lives are needlessly lost.\nDry January\nThis week in Parliament, it was great to visit Alcohol Change’s event for their Dry January campaign.\nFor 14 years, the Government has had no joined-up plan for health and has been unwilling to lead on issues like alcohol harm. Labour will reform the NHS, shifting the focus to prevention, so that people can live healthier and happier lives.\nLiver Disease\nIt was also great to see the British Liver Trust in Parliament this week. The liver has a remarkable ability to repair itself and, if diagnosed early, liver damage can be reversed.\nLabour will use our Fit for the Future fund to purchase the latest MRI and CT scanner technology, accelerating the earlier detection of liver disease and cancer.\nSir Tony Lloyd MP\nI am deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Labour's Sir Tony Lloyd, MP for Rochdale, this week. Tony was a very kind colleague, much loved by all who were lucky enough to know or meet him. My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\nLocal News\nTesco Winter Food Collection\nIt’s great to hear that customers in Birmingham, Edgbaston donated 2,491 meals to the Tesco Winter Food Collection in 2023. Thank you to all who donated.\nTesco will continue to provide support during the school holidays, offering Free Kids Meals in their cafés on presentation of a Clubcard and any purchase 60p or over.\nMHRC\nNext Tuesday, 23rd January, the MHRC will be visiting Leigham Drive, B17 8AT, in Quinton. The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so please do come along if you’re local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nCampaigning\nIf you would like to support me campaigning and join me doorknocking, please contact: officeofpreetgill@gmail.com.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

He also pitched an ambitious UK-EU defence and security partnership, with steps to increase co-operation on shared threats, and go further on cross-border crime and illegal migration, while delivering growth and security at home.\nNick Thomas-Symonds, Minister for the Constitution and European Union Relations, also met with European partners to discuss how we can raise UK living standards by reducing barriers to trade and building export and investment opportunities. Co-operation drives innovation, boosts growth and reduces consumer costs.\nFor this Government, our reset with the EU means the UK being safer, more secure and increasingly prosperous. It does not mean hitting rewind. You can read more about the visit here.\nPay rise\nIn April, over 3 million workers will get a pay rise, putting thousands of pounds back in the pockets of working people.\nThe Government has laid legislation that confirmed a new National Living Wage of £12.21, and a new National Minimum Wage of £10.00 per hour from April.\nThe 6.7% increase to the National Living Wage, worth £1,400 a year for an eligible full-time worker, is a significant step towards delivering our manifesto commitment to deliver a genuine living wage. The National Minimum Wage for 18-20-year-olds is also set to rise by £1.40 to £10.00 per hour – a record increase which means full-time younger workers eligible for the rate will see their pay boosted by £2,500 a year. Read more here.\nSchool Reform\nThe Government has set out new plans to target ‘stuck schools’ struggling to improve. There are 11 ‘stuck’ schools in Birmingham which have received consecutive poor Ofsted judgements.\nThey plans unveiled by the Education Secretary include an initial £20m investment in new regional improvement teams, known as RISE teams, which will prioritise schools struggling to improve. These teams will draw up bespoke improvement plans, with government making up to £100,000 available initially to each school for specialist support. This compares to a £6,000 grant that was previously available under the Conservatives. Find out more here. You can submit to the Government's Ofsted consultation here.\nFraud\nParliament debated the Public Authorities (Fraud, Error & Recovery) Bill, which introduces measures to be tough on criminals, fair for claimants, and provide confidence to the taxpayer.\nFraud against the public sector is a significant and constantly evolving challenge – with public sector losses of at least £55 bn per year in 2023-24. That’s almost as much as we spent on defence in 2024.\nThe Government’s Bill will give the DWP new search and seizure powers, bringing its investigatory powers into line with other public bodies like HMRC, and enable DWP investigators to apply directly to the courts for a warrant to enter fraudsters homes and take evidence to support the investigation.\nThe Bill will also help us protect claimants by stopping errors earlier and preventing those who have made genuine mistakes from unknowingly racking up massive debts. You can read more here.\nPolice Grant\nThe Government has announced a major funding increase for West Midlands Police Force to help deliver on its mission to create safer streets. West Midlands Police will receive an additional £54 million for 2025-26, equivalent to a 6.8% funding boost.\nThis is part of a national funding boost of up to £1.1 billion for police forces across England and Wales, including £200 million to kickstart the recruitment of 13,000 neighbourhood officers and £50 million for Violence Reduction Units to tackle knife crime. Read more here.\nAI Sexual Abuse Offences\nThis week, the UK became the first country in the world to create new AI sexual abuse offences to protect children from predators generating AI images.\nAI tools are being used to generate child sexual abuse images in a number of sickening ways, and are helping perpetrators disguise their initial identity and more effectively groom and abuse children online.\nWe are:\nMaking it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate child sexual abuse material, punishable by up to 5 years in prison.\nMaking it illegal for anyone to possess AI “paedophile manuals” which teach people how to use AI to sexually abuse children, punishable by up to 3 years in prison\nIntroducing a specific offence for predators who run websites designed for other paedophiles to share vile child sexual abuse content or advise on how to groom children, punishable by up to 10 years in prison\nGiving Border Force the necessary powers to keep the UK safe and prevent the distribution of child sexual abuse material which is often filmed abroad by allowing officers to compel an individual who they reasonably suspect poses a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection. Punishable by up to 3 years in prison, depending the on severity.\nRead more here.\nFlooding\nThe Conservatives’ flood defence negligence over the past 14 years was a dereliction of duty that left communities across the country exposed and cost the economy billions,\nThat’s why this week the Government has announced a record £2.65 billion investment in flood defences, supporting over 1000 projects including in the West Midlands. This will better protect 52,000 properties by March 2026 across the country. Read more here.\nNHS\nBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women, with around 55,000 people being diagnosed with the disease every year.\nThis week, the Government announced that nearly 700,000 women across the country will take part in a world-leading trial to test how AI tools can be used to catch breast cancer cases earlier. 30 testing sites across the country will be enhanced with the latest digital AI technologies, ready to invite women already booked in for routine screenings on the NHS to take part.\nThe technology will assist radiologists, screening patients to identify changes in breast tissue that show possible signs of cancer and refer them for further investigations if required.

Read more here.\n3D-printed firearms\nSpeaking to Times Radio\nThis week, I spoke to Times Radio about my Bill to make it illegal to possess the blueprints to 3D-print a firearm.\nWhen I first began researching 3D-printed firearms, I was shocked to discover how easy it was for someone to produce homemade rifles. 3D printers cost as little as £200 and the blueprints to print firearms can easily be downloaded online after a quick google search.\nI’m thrilled that the Government is taking my bill forward to make it illegal to possess the templates to 3D-print a firearm.\nUS-UK Relations\nSpeaking in the debate in Parliament\nI spoke in a Westminster Hall Debate on the UK-US bilateral relationship.\nWhile the Opposition is busy talking down the UK-US relationship, our government is putting national interests first. After the damage caused by the last government, I’m glad that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have made reconnecting with our allies a priority.\nIt is in the national interest to have a strong relationship with both the UK and the EU – this is not a case of ‘either or’. I was shocked to hear the Shadow Business Secretary say last week that improving relations with both the EU and the US was akin to trying to make love simultaneously to both a rhino and a sloth. It is exactly this destructive attitude that has caused so much damage to British businesses and UK trade over the past 14 years.

Our new life sciences park in the West Midlands is set to create thousands of jobs in the region – increasing capacity on our network will support those jobs. Read more here.\nInnovation Visit\nAt West Midlands Health Tech Innovation Accelerator\nIt was great to meet local businesses who are driving innovation in health tech through the West Midlands Health Tech Innovation Accelerator (WMHTIA) programme, on a visit to the University of Birmingham with the West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker.\nThe accelerator programme, funded through Innovate UK, unites academia, business and the NHS to support innovative health tech start-ups with new novel treatments and technologies. The WMHTIA helps with everything from initial business planning and bespoke programmes of training, through to assisted prototyping and real-world NHS testing services. For several of the businesses I spoke to, their aim is to eventually be introduced into our NHS.\nBy working with Britain's brilliant life sciences sector, Labour aims to tackle the biggest killers, reduce the number of lives lost to heart disease, strokes and cancer, and improve healthy life expectancy for everyone across the country.\nBirmingham City Council Funding Settlement\nI welcome the confirmation this week that Birmingham City Council will receive £533.6 million for local services next year, including a record boost in homelessness funding and significant uplift to funding for social care.\nAs well as supporting vital local services, this settlement means that the Council will no longer put up council tax by 10%, something the last government insisted was a necessity.\nAfter 14 years of cuts and fiscal mismanagement, councils of all political stripes are in crisis. But we now have a Government that wants to work with, rather than against, local authorities. Today's announcement of £5 billion of new funding for local services is a significant financial boost.\nWhile Birmingham is not out of the woods yet, today's news demonstrates the progress the Council and the government are making to fix their finances. As always, I will continue to stand with residents to protect the services they rely on and get the essential support they need.

It was good to attend the #CatchUpWithCancer campaign event with Bryan Robson for #WorldCancerDay. Our Labour Government is committed to publishing a dedicated national cancer plan this year to save lives from this disease.\nChildren’s Mental Health Week\nAt Doddington's Children's Centre\nThis week is Place2Be’s Children’s Mental Health Week. It’s vital that every child across the country can easily access the right support at the right time. But we know that there is more to do until we get there. I am pleased to show my support for this campaign.\nLocal News\nUOB Labour Students\nWith University of Birmingham Labour Students\nIt was great to visit the University of Birmingham for an ‘In Conversation’ event with Labour students.\nI enjoyed speaking about my career, discussing the different ways that young people can shape the future of Labour and engaging with various questions from students on a range of topics. It’s always a privilege to talk to young people engaged with politics and invested in the future of the Labour Party.\nUOB Langar on Campus\nWith UoB Sikh Society\nIt was lovely to join the University of Birmingham Sikh Society for their annual Langar on Campus event. Thank you for sharing some of the teachings of the Sikh faith – such as serving society, equality and justice.\nHarborne Day Centre\nWith Cllr Rob Pocock, Alistair Carns MP, Laurence Turner MP and local campaigners outside Harborne Day Centre\nI had a productive meeting about the future of Harborne Day Centre with Cllr Rob Pocock, Alistair Carns MP, Laurence Turner MP and local campaigner James Cross.\nHarborne Day Centre is a lifeline for carers and for those who rely on its services. It’s vital that we work to explore all options to ensure that these people continue to be supported in the community.\nTransformative investment into new Sports Quarter\nMayor Richard Parker and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds at Birmingham City Football Club\nIt's brilliant news that Knightshead is investing £100m into a new Sports Quarter in East Birmingham, which will include a 60,000 seat stadium for Birmingham City Football Club.\nIt is a huge vote of confidence in Birmingham that global investors are committing to create thousands of jobs with billions of pounds of investment in our city. Read more here\nFlytipping\nThe Government has launched the National Waste Crime Survey, which will be open until 24th February. I know that flytipping is an issue for many of my constituents, so I would encourage people to feed into the Government’s survey here.\nNHS Consultation\nWe want your help to build a health service for the future. The Government has launched Change NHS to hear your views, experiences, and ideas which will shape a new 10 Year Health Plan for England. This will run until spring 2025.\nFind out more and submit your views here.\nQuinton PACT Meeting\nOn Friday 21st February, the Quinton neighbourhood police and community (PACT) meeting will take place between 6.30pm and 8pm at St Faith & St Laurence Church, B17 8RD. Please do come along if you have issued that you would like to raise with the police.\nMHWC\nNext Friday, 14th February, the MHWC will be visiting Kelmscott Road in Harborne, B17 8QW. The centre will be open from 7:30am until 1pm, so please do come along if you have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

In 2010, Birmingham City Council were receiving £33.5 million for Sure Start. Today, it stands at just over £10 million with the funding no longer being ringfenced.\nIn Edgbaston constituency the impact of Covid and the cost-of-living crisis is becoming clear as Doddington Green Children’s Centre has seen a significant increase in:\nSupport for parents with regard to emotional wellbeing.\nParents receiving advice regarding domestic abuse via the domestic abuse Freedom Programme.\nAdults and Children attending Language and Signing groups.\nEarly help assessments.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said:\n“Early years are crucial in determining children’s life chances and we need to ensure that the early years system delivers high-quality, preventative services. The last Labour Government invested heavily in Sure Start Children’s Centres and the Every Child Matters agenda which saw huge boosts to the educational and life chances of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n“It is appalling to see 12 years of Conservative Governments systematically closing these centres because it is devastating for the families it effects. That is why places like Doddington Green Children’s Centre are so important and the work the staff here carry out is vital. I believe it is time to give childcare the attention it deserves and to make Britain the best place to grow up in.”\nBarnardo’s, who oversee the centre on behalf of Birmingham City Council, is calling for the extension of family hubs to all communities. In its 2021 report ‘It Takes a Village: The Case for Family Support in Every Community’ Barnardo’s calculated that for every £1 invested in a similar service on the Isle of Wight, £2.60 of savings were generated.",

Nationally, the number of commercial units falling vacant during the crisis rose to 2,426 compared with an increase of 1,374 between 2018 and 2020.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, said: “During the pandemic, businesses in Birmingham did the right thing and supported us when we needed them most. The impact of this loss in sales shows just how badly our city has been hit. Birmingham has been neglected for too long and it’s time our city gets its fair share of funding.\n“My constituents value their high streets and won’t accept the slow decline the Tories have overseen in the last 11 years. While inflation soars and businesses face a Covid hangover, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are too distracted with their own scandals to meet the challenges facing our city.\n“During the pandemic, I launched the ‘Save Our Banks’ campaign in Harborne, supporting the Co-operatives ‘Unlock the High Street’ campaign so that my constituents across Quinton, Bartley Green, Harborne and Edgbaston, continue to have access to cash and have a central high street to visit which they can be proud of. The Government needs to stop the dither and delay and deliver on the levelling up agenda it promised.”\nTo save our high streets, Labour has pledged to cut business rates and level the tax playing field for high street businesses and online firms.\nNotes to editors:",

Respect Orders – promised in Labour’s 2024 manifesto and delivered today – will enable swift enforcement against persistent antisocial behaviour offenders.\nThe Orders come as shock data shows that West Midlands Police Force failed to hand out a SINGLE Penalty Notice for Disorder for ASB in 2023.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper’s Bill also includes action on shoplifting, including introducing a new offence of assaulting a retail worker.\nLabour will also scrap the Tory ‘shoplifter’s charter’, a law which deprioritised the theft of goods under £200. Stats show there were 28,542 incidences of shoplifting in the West Midlands Police Force Area, around 549 per week.\nIn 2023, Conservative Policing Minister Chris Philp was roundly mocked when he urged members of the public to make citizen’s arrests on those they witnessed shoplifting.\nLabour’s bill will also give the police new powers to enter premises without a warrant, enabling the police to search and seize stolen property swiftly which they believe is at an address.\nLabour’s action comes as the number of snatch thefts last year reached 85,000 across England and Wales.\nThe new measures will be supported by the government’s plan to recruit 13,000 additional police officers, PCSOs and special constables into neighbourhood policing roles over the course of this Parliament.\nWest Midlands Police has been granted a 6.8% increase in funding to deliver the reforms.\nPreet Kaur Gill, Labour MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said:\n“After fourteen years of Conservative rule, our town centres and neighbourhoods are plagued by anti-social behaviour. The people of Birmingham will wholeheartedly welcome the tough new action included in Labour's bill. Whether it’s street drinking, harassment or vandalism on the high street or noisy and intimidating off-road bikes terrorising our estates, my constituents are fed up.\n“As Chair of the Co-operative Party Parliamentary Group, it’s great to see Labour taking swift action to crack down on shoplifters and protect shop workers, after a successful campaign by the Co-operative Party and Usdaw which put the issue of shoplifting on the Government’s agenda.\n“The flagship Crime and Policing Bill is a vital step towards the safer streets promised in this Government’s Plan for Change”.\nEnds\nNotes\n• Chris Philp comments: https://www.thetimes.com/article/if-you-see-a-shoplifterarrest-them-yourself-police-minister-says-0pvnkxq5h\n• Data for PNDs: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-justicesystem-statistics-quarterly-december-2023 Out of court disposals data tool.\n• Data for shoplifting: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bullet ins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2024/relateddata , Police Force Area data tables, table P1.\n• Data for snatch thefts: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bullet ins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2024/relateddata, Appendix Tables, Worksheet A1.",

England has one of the oldest housing stocks in the developed world and one of the lowest rates of social housing replacement. However, the Conservative Government has also failed to retrofit the worst energy efficient homes, leaving families losing hundreds of pounds a year in heat loss and forced to deal with damp and mould in their homes.\nThe Birmingham MP also went on to ask:\nHow many properties in Birmingham have been treated for issues relating to damp and mould?\nHow many more than once?\nWhat is the council doing to tackle the underlying problem of mould in properties?\nWill council properties be a priority as a part of the three cities retrofit programme?\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “While Awaab’s death was devastating, it was also preventable. Across Birmingham, there are 60,000 council properties and thousands more in social housing and the private sector which need urgent attention. That’s why I am calling on the council to lead on this and call on Government to fund a retrofit programme for all council housing.\n“Birmingham has had almost £1 billion taken from its budget over the last 12 years by Conservatives. This has meant halving the workforce and putting services across the city at breaking point. I will be writing to Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Community, as it is unacceptable that funding for retrofitting won’t be available until 2025. This is simply too late and puts lives at risk.\n“Labour’s plan to retrofit 19 million homes would not only would save families hundreds of pounds on their energy bills but would prevent the issue of mould in properties, saving Birmingham City Council millions of pounds in reoccurring repairs. If Government had listened to the Labour Party last year, we would be on track to have already retrofitted 2 million homes.”\nIn her letter, Preet outlined how the issue of damp was one of the largest causes of complaints from her constituents and how of the 160 outstanding cases she has with the council, almost all of them were reoccurring.\nVicky Mclaughlin, a constituent of Preet’s in Bartley Green said, \"For the last decade, I have been left in a council house with my partner who has severe asthma and our three young children, living with mould and damp. I have followed all the council's guidance to make sure the property is well ventilated and every time it has reappeared, I have reported it to the council to ask them to fix it. Every time the council has come out, they have simply repainted over the problem. It hasn't fixed the underlying issue of damp. Now, I just want to move house to a property that doesn't leave me in fear of making my family severely ill.\n\"I would like to thank Preet for all of her help over the last few years. Thanks to her intervention, I was offered another property by the council. Sadly, this property had the exact same problems with mould and so it wasn't possible to accept it.\n\"I support Preet in her campaign to get council homes to a decent standard. No one should be made to live how we currently are, and I hope the Government backs Birmingham City Council to allow them to do this work.\"\nPhotos from the property of Vicky Mclaughlin below.\nRead the full letter to Deborah Cadman, Chief Executive of Birmingham City Council below.",

Data shows average deposits are going up by £9,000, house building targets have been scrapped, and new social home builds are at record lows.\nWhat this means for millions of families and young adults – including many in Birmingham – is that they are often stuck privately renting, living day in and day out with the knowledge that they could be uprooted with little notice and minimal, if any, justification. Homeownership for them is becoming more impossible the longer the Conservatives are in power.\nLabour will tackle the housing crisis by helping families into homeownership with a new, comprehensive mortgage guarantee scheme and give them ‘first dibs’ on newly built homes. We’ll introduce a powerful Private Renters’ Charter to make renting fairer, more secure, and more affordable. And we’ll empower local communities to build more high-quality and affordable homes.\nOnly Labour has a plan to build a better Britain!\nLeading for Labour on Sudan\nOn Tuesday, I responded on behalf of the Labour Party to a statement from the Government about Sudan. I raised the urgent matter of assistance for Britons who remain in the country, and I was clear that Britain must do all it can to end the bloodshed and support the Sudanese civilians who have been caught in crossfire. Please find a clip of my contribution below.\nThe situation unfolding in Sudan is truly heart-breaking to witness. The Sudanese people want and deserve peace, but these hopes are again being denied to them and I remain deeply concerned for all British nationals who remain in Sudan, and for the Sudanese people who deserve to live in a peaceful country.\nSince the recent violence erupted, I have been contacted by Edgbaston residents who found themselves stuck in Sudan - including Dr Lina Badr who I am pleased to confirm arrived safely in the UK this week. I have made representations to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on behalf of residents like Lina. If you are concerned about an Edgbaston friend or family member in Sudan, please do not hesitate to contact me on 0121 392 8426 or email preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk.\nI, and the Labour Party, extend thanks to our dedicated armed services and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office personnel. My thoughts remain with British nationals in Sudan and the Sudanese people.\nWe must not allow the world’s gaze to turn from Sudan once the airlifts have ended.\nOmar’s Legacy Library\nOn Thursday, I visited Four Dwellings Academy and had the honour of officially opening their revamped and restocked 'Omar's Legacy Library'.\nThe library has been named by pupils who voted from a selection of names. They voted for 'Omar's Legacy Library' as Omar was a pupil at Four Dwellings and very sadly passed away in 2015, shortly after taking his GCSE examinations.\nDuring my visit, I answered exploring questions from Year 8 pupils who demonstrated a genuine interest in what it means to be a Member of Parliament and a Frontbencher. They also raised important questions about improving our constituency, young people’s voice, and the importance of reading.\nThrough reading, we can escape the hustle and bustle of our busy lives and immerse ourselves in new and imaginative worlds. I am therefore pleased to see Four Dwellings dedicate such a strong focus on reading. I am certain pupils will come to get a lot of joy from Omar’s Legacy Library!\nI look forward to hearing from Four Dwellings in the future and welcome invitations from other schools in our constituency for visits.\nRohingya Refugees in Bangladesh Debate\nThis week, represented the Labour Party by delivering a closing contribution to an important debate on support for Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh.\nIt’s nearly six years since that fateful morning in the early hours of 25 August 2017 when violence broke out in Rakhine state, Myanmar. Military attacks on the civilian population are up nearly 400%. Over 600 villages have been torched by the junta’s troops. A staggering 17.6 million people need humanitarian assistance.\nSome 1 million Rohingya refugees are currently languishing in south-eastern Bangladesh with no meaningful prospect of a future, and we cannot ignore that either.\nI made clear to the Minister that, as international attention dwindles, it is imperative that Britain plays its full part in the response to the Rohingya crisis. Britain is known across the world as a beacon of hope and I know residents in Edgbaston will expect the Government to reflect on their role and offer support to one of the world's most harrowing crises.\nThe full debate is available below through the BBC.\nConstituency Coronation Events\nThis weekend will see the first coronation in seventy years.

Tooth decay is the number one reason for hospital admission among kids aged between six and ten; one in four children are obese by the time they leave primary school; and 200,000 children are stuck on an English mental health waiting list.\nLabour wants the next generation to be chasing their dreams, not a dentist appointment.\nLabour's Child Health Action Plan will create the healthiest and happiest generation of children ever. Our plan is based around three simple goals for Britain's future, each of which is supported by bold action as first steps on the road to delivery.\nA future where children are healthy:\nImplementing the 9pm watershed for junk food advertising on television and ban paid-for advertising of less healthy foods on online media aimed at children\nA free breakfast club in every primary school so every child is able to start the day with a healthy breakfast and parents are able to get to work\nBanning vapes from being advertised to appeal to children, and make sure that the incremental smoking ban passes through Parliament\nIntroducing a targeted national supervised toothbrushing programme for three-to-five-year-olds in our fully funded breakfast clubs.\nA future where children are happy:\nCutting waiting lists for mental health services by recruiting thousands more staff\nIntroducing specialist mental health support for children and young people in every school\nDelivering an open access children and young people’s mental health hub for every community.\nA future where children can get the NHS care they need:\nCutting paediatric waiting times by delivering two million more operations, scans and appointments\nGiving the NHS the tools and tech it needs to see children more quickly by doubling the number of MRI and CT scanners\nDelivering 700,000 extra urgent dental appointments per year and recruit dentists to areas most in need, so more children can see a dentist when they really need one\nCreating a cross-departmental mission delivery board that prioritises child health and includes a focus on inequalities, well-being, physical and mental health.\nLink to Labour's plan below:\nIn Parliament\nThis week, Labour tabled a motion in the House of Commons to rescue NHS dentistry.\nAfter 14 years of Tory government, the NHS is dying a slow death. Labour analysis has found that more than half of dental surgeries in England aren’t accepting any new patients – with 8 in 10 refusing to take on adults and 7 in 10 shutting their doors to new child patients. In Louth and Horncastle, the Health Secretary’s constituency, not a single practice is accepting new adult patients.\nAs one Birmingham dentist put it: \"the system is on the verge of collapse – and the only stakeholder that will eventually lose out is the patient.”\nThe Tories voted down Labour’s plan to rescue NHS dentistry. Our motion proposed:\n• 700,000 more urgent dentistry appointments\n• Incentives to recruit dentists to the areas most in need\n• Supervised toothbrushing in schools for three- to five-year-olds\n• Reform of the NHS dental contract so everyone who needs a dentist can get one\nWe would fund our rescue plan by scrapping the non-dom tax status, because our constituents need dentists' appointments more than the wealthy need tax breaks.\nIn Parliament\nOn Thursday, I spoke in a Westminster Hall Debate about securing a smokefree future.\nOne of the clearest cases to do more on smoking is the impact on children. 9% of mothers were smokers at the time of delivery last year – still some 50% above the government’s 6% target. At the current rate of progress, we will not hit that goal until 2032.\nChildren born to households that smoke are more likely to be born with heart defects, to be born underweight, and to grow up to be smokers themselves, if they grow up at all.\nSmoking in pregnancy doubles the likelihood of stillbirth, increases the risk of pre-term birth and miscarriage, and trebles the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.\nLabour would make sure all hospital trusts integrate ‘opt-out’ smoking cessation interventions into routine care, with a named lead on smoking cessation, so parents have all the support they need to quit and every interaction with the NHS encourages quitting.\nHealth Mission Tour\nThis week, I joined Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting in Manchester to launch Labour’s Health Mission Tour.\nIt was great to chat with health leaders from across the North West, those representing national charities, Royal Colleges, and NHS leaders about Labour’s plan to make an NHS fit for the future.\nLocal News\nMeasles\nAs you may know, the UK has been seeing higher numbers of measles infections than usual. There are now 180 cases in Birmingham, and nationwide a National Incident has been declared. The disease spreads very easily and can lead to serious problems for some.\nThe best way to prevent measles is to have the MMR vaccine. This vaccine is available at every GP practice, and it is free.\nThe MMR vaccine is safe for every faith. There is a type of MMR vaccine that does not contain pork gelatine, so it can be used for people who do not touch any pork products.\nMore information on the NHS website here:\nMHRC\nOn Wednesday 17th January, the MHRC will be visiting Westfield Road, Edgbaston, B15 3JF. The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so do come along if you’re local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nCampaigning\nIf you would like to support me campaigning and join me doorknocking, please contact: officeofpreetgill@gmail.com.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

They spoke of a broad range of issues that had affected staff and patients throughout the pandemic including the vital work taking place to improve women’s health, tackling the stigma that still exists around issues like menopause and abortion and the impact which Covid-19 has had on unvaccinated mums-to-be.\nMore urgently, staff outlined the dramatic increase in domestic abuse cases they received and the change in approach to safeguarding concerns. Preet was shown how the role of doctors and nurses changed to no longer focus purely on care but social support for women. We need to ensure more emphasis on supporting women's wellbeing is recognised by Government.\nThe impact of both unprecedented levels of domestic abuse and multiple lockdowns has seen the need for mental health support increase. It has been reported that mental health referrals, particularly amongst young people increased by as much as 77% nationally placing additional pressures on an already fragile support system.\nAs part of this discussion, Preet also met with senior directors from Forward Thinking Birmingham, who provide mental health support for young people in the city.\nCommenting on the visit, Preet said, “It was fantastic to meet with dedicated NHS staff who worked relentlessly and to be able to say thank you to them in person for all that they have done to keep us safe.\n“I also found great value in being able to discuss the challenges and obstacles that staff are facing when it comes to delivering a fit-for-purpose health service. We need a mental health system that can meet growing demand, that is on a parity with physical health practices, and which puts community at its heart. We continue to see our city’s services having to do more with less and so it is absolutely imperative that any mental health model, needs to be implemented from the bottom up with local residents at the very centre.”",

Labour’s plans are the equivalent of giving every constituency in England and Wales 15-20 extra neighbourhood police - formed of officers, PCSOs, and Specials.\nThe announcement comes as the most recent crime statistics for the West Midlands show a 71% increase in reported robbery since 2015 and more worryingly, knife crime in the West Midlands stands at the highest rate anywhere outside of London with a 115% increase from 2015 to the end of 2022.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “Policing cannot be done on the cheap – whether in terms of funding or Officer numbers. Fewer Police means victims feel let down, fewer criminals face justice, communities feel under threat and public confidence in the Police falls. In my constituency, residents too often tell me that they never see a police officer on the beat. Given that crime and anti-social behaviour has soared, 20 extra neighbourhood police would double the number of Police across the constituency and reduce crime on a scale that we haven’t seen since the last Labour Government.\n“This is why I wrote to the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman MP, to ask what she would say to my constituents who are deeply fearful for their communities and when my constituency and region will see Police and PSCO numbers increased?

But the neighbourhood police who could prevent crimes like this and support victims have disappeared.\n“Labour has a serious plan to bring back neighbourhood policing, with a fully funded package for 13,000 extra neighbourhood police on our streets. The last Labour government brought in neighbourhood policing, and now, after more than a decade of Tory neglect, we will restore it.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\nPolice workforce, year to March 2022 - https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2022 (Tables F1, F3)\nPolice workforce, year to March 2016 - https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2016 (Tables F1, F3)\nCrime in England and Wales, police force area data tables (Year to Sept 2022 and Year to Sept 2015) - https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/policeforceareadatatables\nLabour’s extra officers will be funded through a Police Efficiency & Collaboration programme, establishing:\nCentralised standard-setting for procurement (at least £225m);\nIncreased collaboration on shared services and specialist functions (at least £145m).",

Really, Rishi? After 13 years of Tory chaos, people who work hard and pay their mortgages are having their dreams of homeownership crushed. And not just those dreams – this government has also overseen soaring energy bills, astronomical food shops, and a fall in real wages. Households are dipping into savings at a record level; interest rates are at a 15-year high.\nThis week in Parliament, I voted to give all mortgage holders access to support. The same Prime Minister that is asking people to “hold their nerve” during an economic crisis is too weak to make lenders act to save people’s homes. Millions of people could miss out on mortgage help under the Government’s voluntary measures. Labour would bring in a mandatory mortgage package, reform planning and build homes.\nLabour will tackle this Tory economic crisis and provide financial security for families!\nITV Central\nThis week, I spoke to ITV Central about Birmingham City Council’s equal pay claims and ongoing budget crisis.\nThe revelation that the council now needs to find up to £760 million for equal pay claims, rising by an additional maximum £14 million a month, is deeply concerning. Even more concerning that this is happening after the Government took £1 billion off the council through austerity cuts, forcing the council to halve its workforce as a result.\nI am, of course, concerned about the impact that this will have on my constituents. It should not fall on Birmingham’s residents to pay the price for equal pay claims. The Government should step up to support Birmingham City Council to fund essential services.\nWoodhouse Primary visit\nIt was a real joy meeting students from Woodhouse Primary School as they did a visit and tour of the House of Commons.\nIt’s so important that young people learn how Parliament works and how it links to their day-to-day lives. I hope after talking to me they better understand what an MP does and can see how I’m able to represent their needs in Parliament.\nAs always, I want to thank the Parliamentary Education and Engagement Team who work so hard throughout the year to deliver award-winning political engagement to primary, secondary, and post-16 providers. This includes organising tours, delivering workshops, assemblies, and other interactive sessions.\nI strongly encourage other schools and colleges in our constituency to engage with the outreach team in Parliament. Click the button below for more information.\nRegarding speeding\nSpeeding, illegal off-road quad bike use, and noise pollution are concerns I hear about weekly. In recent weeks I have noticed an uptick in emails and calls about this. On Monday alone I opened five emails from residents expressing worry for speeding on their road.\nAfter raising these issues with our local Police, I also took this matter to the top of government by tabling Parliamentary Questions. You can find my questions and the answers provided by clicking the button below.\nI asked whether the Transport Secretary plans to allow Birmingham City Council and other local authorities to keep the revenue collected from speeding fines. Doing so would mean that money could be reinvested locally to tackle speeding. The Government said it has no plans to allow this.\nI also wrote to the Transport Secretary about steps being taken to crack down on the sale of modified exhaust parts. The Government responded that vehicle owners have relative freedom to modify their own vehicles, but that prosecutions will be taken when there is sufficient evidence to do so.\nMeanwhile, I asked whether the Home Secretary believes the Police have sufficient powers and resources to deal with the illegal use of off-road quad bikes. The Government replied saying they have ‘adequate’ powers. Of course, since 2010, our region has seen police numbers cut and resources slashed. I will continue to raise this matter with our local Police Inspector and ward Sergeants and I urge residents to actively report through 101.\nLastly, I have discussed these matters with Birmingham City Council’s Highways Department. Unfortunately, Birmingham lost out in its bid to participate in a government trial using noise cameras to tackle speeding and noise pollution. However, should the trial prove successful it could be rolled out in Birmingham.\nI hope residents see that I am working hard to tackle these matters.\nLocal News\nThis week, National Express West Midlands confirmed its continued participation in the Government’s £2 single fare cap until 31 October. As a result, anyone doing two journeys in a day will pay just £4, the same as a current day ticket and saving 50p off the day ticket from 3rd July.\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recyling Centre will be visiting Hermitage Road, B15 3UP, on Monday 3rd July, and Rutley Grove, B32 2LT, on Friday 7th July. The centre will be open from 07:00 to 12:30, so please come along if you’re local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

This must be done by increasing neighbourhood policing, including by ringfencing a proportion of the Police Uplift Programme to deliver neighbourhood officers for every local authority in England and Wales.\nMs Gill has spoken out following new figures which show the impact of 13 years of Conservative Government that has left the country with 6,000 fewer neighbourhood police officers, 8,500 fewer Police Community Support Officers and over 20 million people who witnessed or experienced antisocial behaviour just last year.\nThese figures, along with the current unfair funding formula, have had a significant impact on the West Midlands which has been disproportionately affected by crime. The West Midlands has seen the number of PCSOs, falling from 1,466 in 2010 to 877 last year and that is despite the Police and Crime Commissioners success in securing the region with additional officers. That is a decrease of more than 40%.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “After 13 years, the Conservative legacy is criminals being let off while victims are being let down. Everyone has a right to feel safe and secure in their homes and in their community. But the Conservatives failure means it is the millions of victims that are paying the price.\n“As a mother of two young girls, I know the worry that parents have about their children playing in the park or being targeted online. Knife crime alone has increased in the West Midlands by 115% since 2015. It’s why this question around crime and anti-social behaviour must tackle more than just policing. We must also look at our youth services which have also been decimated.\n“In my constituency of Edgbaston, the Government could have made a big difference by simply granting our levelling up bid. This would have seen Quinton Police Station transformed into a community hub, providing a base for the Police but also giving additional support for youth provision, local training and reskilling. Instead, they once again chose to put party first, country second. The bid was refused and instead, the biggest regional recipients were those where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to losing marginal seats to Labour. That’s not fair or right.\n“The last Labour government cut crime by a third and rolled out neighbourhood policing across the country. The next Labour government will rebuild neighbourhood policing through a £360m package, delivering 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat.”\nUnder Labour’s plan, every constituency in England and Wales will get an average of 15-20 additional police on the beat. In Birmingham Edgbaston, this will mean doubling the existing neighbourhood policing capacity.\nLabour will also be tough on the causes of crime, outlawing the grooming of kids for crime, providing mentors for children who are sent to Pupil Referral Units to help get them back on track, and linking youth workers to hospitals and custody suites to reach young people who are becoming involved in gangs as part of a nationwide strategy to tackle youth vulnerability to crime.",

PM Skerrit, who leads the Dominica Labour Party and is the first patron of the group, was welcomed by Gill and Labour Minister Douglas Alexander as the keynote speaker at the event.\nLFC has been founded with a clear mission: to unite Labour Parties across the Commonwealth in pursuit of our shared values—rooted in justice, equality, and solidarity. Echoing Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s words at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), Gill expressed her determination to forge closer links between Commonwealth nations in order to grasp the global opportunities and challenges democratic nations share.\nThe Commonwealth is an extraordinary global community, spanning nearly a third of the world’s population. Its diversity—of culture, geography, wealth, and tradition—is unique among international groupings. The UK itself has deep connections to the Commonwealth through its diaspora, shared history and common ideals, as set out in the United Nations Charter.\nThe launching ceremony saw the presence of Labour leaders, visionaries and advocates from the Commonwealth nations who shared views on evolving challenges and opportunities for democracies in a contested world.\nDominica PM Dr Roosevelt Skerrit speaks\nIn his keynote address, PM Skerrit spoke about the necessity of the Commonwealth nations to join hands in collective determination to shape their shared futures. He said history will be kind to the Commonwealth nations by remembering their contribution.\nThe PM also said that especially for Dominica and other Small Island Developing States, the Commonwealth platform is as important as its global Labour connections with other parts of the world.\nHe also emphasised the importance of social justice, sustainable development, cultural diversity and protection of democracy, a task challenged by political polarisation and misinformation.\nWhile suggesting that innovative action will be required to address these challenges, the Caribbean leader highlighted his country’s efforts in modernising its electoral system and promoting transparency, inclusivity and good governance. The PM also spoke about the state’s responsibility to embrace technology to bridge the gap between governments and people.\nHe highlighted the importance of economic equality where everyone has equal access to key facilities, such as healthcare. Furthermore, PM Skerrit also underscored the significance of sustainable development and gave the example of how Dominica has invested in geothermal energy, with the assistance of the UK Government. Furthermore, PM Skerrit emphasised in his speech the usefulness of international and regional partnerships, including LFC.\n“The Commonwealth represents a shared legacy, reminding us of our responsibility to foster stronger, more inclusive democracies,” added Prime Minister Dr Roosevelt Skerrit.\nMP Preet Kaur Gill Highlights Commonwealth’s Global Influence\nChair of LFC, Preet Kaur Gill MP remarked on the weight that the Commonwealth carries and how it has evolved into an important forum in crucial matters, ranging from climate change to geopolitics to trade.\nThe Indian-origin MP from Birmingham Edgbaston said the Commonwealth nations are home to a third of the world’s population and stressed post-Brexit UK’s need to unite with allies for new collaborations.\nGill said in her parting statement, “The Commonwealth is a model we can draw on to inspire cooperation and positive change in an uncertain world. We are stronger together.”\nShe invited Labour MPs and leaders to join the new group, remarking: “Let’s strengthen the bonds between us, amplify our collective voice, and forge a progressive movement that truly reflects the hopes and ambitions of the 2.5 billion people across this extraordinary community.”\nLabour Trade Minister and Former Secretary of State for International Development, Douglas Alexander, also addressed attendees during the event. He highlighted that the UK Labour Party’s roots are internationalist and that the Commonwealth is a force for good in an uncertain world.\nHe added that under the Labour’s stable leadership, the UK has a great opportunity to work closely with Labour parties from around the world for peace, combating climate change, and promoting economic prosperity and security.\nLFC’s objectives\nLabour Friends of the Commonwealth (LFC), which focuses on strengthening ties between Labour Parties across the Commonwealth, has among its aims: promoting equitable partnerships among member states; advocating for sustainable economic development; addressing global issues like climate change, social justice and reforms in governance; and amplifying the voice of the Commonwealth on the international stage.\nThe platform also says that LFC is drawing upon the deep historical links between Labour Parties, and will facilitate projects and policies to empower the least advantaged and strive for unity in the spirit of democratic values.\n“Our Labour principles will guide us every step of the way as we march towards a better tomorrow, as a Commonwealth that is Stronger Together,” says Labour Friends of the Commonwealth.\nThe launching event saw interactions between participants on democratic challenges and opportunities. It also served as a platform for leaders from the Labour parties, policymakers, and advocates to strategise for a sustainable and progressive future.\nThe event concluded with LFC reinforcing its transformative mission for democracy, social justice, and sustainable development.\n“Labour Friends of the Commonwealth supports deepening collaboration with Labour parties from across the Commonwealth. In a world with growing inequality and instability, Labour Friends of Commonwealth draws Labour parties together in the belief in, and advocacy of, a more inclusive, sustainable future,” the LFC.\nMission and Vision of Labour Friends of the Commonwealth\nThe Labour Friends of the Commonwealth initiative is built on the foundation of strengthening relationships between Labour parties and leaders within the Commonwealth to promote inclusive and forward-thinking governance.

Unlike the Conservatives, Keir Starmer is ready to renew our politics so it once again serves our country.\nSwitch Radio\nOn Christmas Day, I appeared on Switch Radio to run through some of my favourite songs and discuss my journey into politics.\nIf you missed it, you can listen to the full episode here:\nNew Years\nI celebrated New Years with my local congregation at the Guru Nanak Gurdwara Smethwick this year, praying for the betterment of all. It was lovely to gather with so many to welcome in the new year, striving for peace, justice, and love.\nWoodhouse Primary Academy\nI was thrilled to see Woodhouse Primary Academy achieve the Inclusive School Award with Flagship status. A massive thanks to all the staff at the school for their dedication and commitment to the young people they teach. Well deserved!\nBolingo Care Birmingham Branch\nI was glad to see Bolingo Care Birmingham Branch be awarded a ‘Good’ rating by CQC. Patient care and safety is of paramount concern to all of us – I really appreciate the care staff for all the brilliant work they do.\nI will be following up on progress in areas of improvement required.\nArt and Culture\nThe UK is one of the best countries in the world when it comes to art and culture. Although, many of my constituents are concerned that the policies being pursued by this government will damage British arts and cultural exports. I wrote to the Education Secretary, expressing their concerns that the government ought to be making it easier for young people from all backgrounds to aspire to the cultural industries, rather than creating barriers.\nLocal News\nDentistry U-Turn\nI've been concerned to discover that dentistry in the West Midlands is to be significantly impacted, due to a withdrawal of proposed NHS funding. West Midlands ICBs have said that this decision has been taken as a result of financial pressures in the NHS elsewhere.\nI will be writing to regional ICBs, asking them to explain why there has been no transparency around this decision, and for their assessment of how this will impact residents of Birmingham and the West Midlands.\nAdvice Surgeries\nNo advice surgeries will be happening in January. Surgeries will resume on Friday 2nd February, and Thursday 8th February. In the meantime, if you need to contact me, please call 0121 392 8426 or email preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk.\nPolice Surgery\nThe next West Midlands Police surgery will be taking place at the Sandwell Aquatic Centre on Friday 12th January from 16:30 until 18:00. Please come along to share any concerns you may have and to fill out a short anonymous survey about how you feel about your local police team.\nPrimary School Places\nReminder that if you have a child starting primary school in September 2024, you need to apply for a place by 15th January. Follow the link below for more info.\nMHRC\nNext week, the MHRC will be visiting Simmons Drive (next to the shop), B32 1SL, on Monday 8th January, Metchley Drive, B17 0IX, on Tuesday 9th January, and The Holloway (in the car park), B31 1TR, on Friday 12th January.

They brought in a New Patient Premium scheme that didn’t have any impact for new patients, with figures this week revealing that £88 million was wasted on the scheme.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said:\n“Everyone in Birmingham, and across the country, knows the scale of the challenge facing NHS dentistry after years of failure under the Tories.\n“In recent years it has become near impossible to get an NHS dental appointment and it is scandalous that the number one reason that five to nine year olds are admitted to hospital is because of tooth decay.\n“I know that this is just the start and we need to see dental contract reform, but I am delighted that this Labour Government is taking such an important step not only repairing NHS dentistry but making it fit for the future.\n“Labour made a promise and is now delivering that promise through our Plan for Change.”\nStephen Kinnock, Minister of State for Care said:\n“We promised we would end the misery faced by hundreds of thousands of people unable to get urgent dental care. Today we’re starting to deliver on that commitment.\n“NHS dentistry has been left broken after years of neglect with patients left in pain without appointments or queueing around the block just to be seen.\n“Through our Plan for Change, this government will rebuild dentistry – focusing on prevention, retention of NHS dentists and reforming the NHS contract to make NHS work more appealing to dentists and increase capacity for more patients. This will take time but today marks an important step towards getting NHS dentistry back on its feet.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\n• The number of patients, by region, who tried unsuccessfully to get an NHS dental appointment in the last 2 years can be found here.\n• NHS England has today written to integrated care boards (ICB) across the country, directing health chiefs in each region to stand up thousands of urgent appointments over the next year.\n• The extra appointments will be available from April and have been targeted at dental deserts – areas where patients particularly struggle to access NHS dentists.\n• Each ICB has a target of urgent appointments to roll out, based on estimated local levels of unmet need for urgent NHS care. Levels of unmet need are calculated by measures including looking at how many people tried and failed to get an NHS dentist appointment.\n• These extra appointments will be for patients who are likely to be in pain – including those suffering from infections or needing urgent repairs to a bridge – and require urgent treatment. NHS commissioners will be working fast to secure these extra appointments this year, with appointments to start coming online from April.\n• Urgent care appointments to be delivered by Birmingham and Solihull ICB: 9,005",

It provides vital services to the Sikh community in Sandwell and the West Midlands, with a weekly congregation of approximately 10,000. It is an iconic place of worship that also functions as a community hub open to all.\nPreet Kaur Gill and Craig Guildford have co-ordinated meetings at GNG Smethwick since February 2024 with representatives of Gurdwaras from West Midlands and representatives of Sikh organisations to address community concerns, before the meeting on Sunday.\nThese concerns have included those relating to the Sikh identity, security and safety of Sikhs in the West Midlands and hate targeting Sikh activists and religious institutions.\nPreet Kaur Gill and the senior leadership of West Midlands Police discussed the role of the Gurdwara as a third-party reporting centre for hate crime and the ongoing support the police can provide to the community.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“I welcome the Chief Constable’s commitment to working with the wider Sikh community to build trust. It’s vital that we work together so that the police can better understand our community.\n“This is an important moment for Sikh Gurdwara’s to have direct links with police officers, given a previous breakdown of trust.”\nActing Chief Constable Scott Green said:\n\"We're proud to work alongside our communities across Sandwell and we're continuing to rebuild stronger relationships with members of the Sikh community.\n\"It's important we fully understand any issues and concerns so we can take action to deal with them and recognise that there had previously been a break down in trust and confidence from the Sikh community to West Midlands Police.\n\"Our Sandwell Local Policing Area commander Kim Madill, and her local teams, are working tirelessly to keep the borough safe for everyone. They will continue to engage with diverse communities and tackle issues in Sandwell including developing their relationship with the Council for the Gurdwaras to build on the conversations held over the last 12 months with representatives from the Sikh Community in the West Midlands.”\nKuldeep Singh Deol, President of Guru Nanak Gurdwara said:\n“Over the last year we collectively as gurdwaras across the West Midlands engaged in numerous meetings with Preet Kaur Gill and senior officers from West Midlands Police (WMP) to address our concerns about the safety of Sikhs. Sikhs have increasingly been worried about crime, safety of places of worship, transnational repression and use of schedule 7 stops at borders under the last government.\n“These ongoing dialogues aim to strengthen our relationship with WMP and build collaborative efforts to improve the safety and well-being of Sikhs, as well as all other communities.\n“We thank Preet Kaur Gill and Craig Guildford for the engagement and rebuilding of this vital relationship. Their leadership should be commended.”",

This follows changes that have been put in place by the school’s senior leadership over recent years.\nIn 2014, the school was rated ‘Inadequate’. However, following a dramatic transition and the hard work over several years of staff, including Head Teacher, Lee Williams, its latest Ofsted inspection report rated Lordswood Boys’ as ‘Good’.\nThe report outlined that “pupils enjoy attending Lordswood Boys’ School and receive a good quality of education”. It also states that “All staff have a shared desire to improve the school and pupils understand that education can open up opportunities for them to become positive and productive members of society.”\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said:\nIt is fantastic to see this incredible transformation. This Ofsted result is well-deserved following the work staff have put in to make this change a reality. It’s great to know that pupils attending Lordswood Boys’ will receive the best possible education and can be ambitious about what they want to achieve, knowing their teachers will support them. I would like to thank all the staff and teachers for putting in so much effort to make sure children in Edgbaston constituency receive the start in life they should be entitled to.\nLee Williams, Headteacher at Lordswood Boys’ School said:\nWe are delighted with the inspection outcome. The students and staff at Lordswood Boys' School are fully deserving of the praise and recognition within the report and it is our intention to continue our work in embedding and enhancing the educational opportunities. Lordswood Boys' School is now a school of choice; a school that the community can trust and rely on. I am immensely proud of our collective achievement.",

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_weekly-update-17-february/content_359.html": "Weekly update - 17 February\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Feb 17, 2023\n- 5 min read\nOn Wednesday, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) made a statement showing how far the Labour Party has come in the last two years in tearing out antisemitism in the party. Under Keir Starmer's leadership, the Labour Party is becoming, once again, an open and welcoming place for people from all backgrounds, and all communities and we’re never going back.\nAntisemitism is an evil and no political party that cultivates it deserves to hold power. I am proud to be in a party and a team that is working tirelessly to root it out. Labour is a party of patriotism and equality and together, we’ll deliver a better country.\nCrime and anti-social behaviour in the constituency\nAcross our constituency, crime is increasing and it’s something residents are writing to me about on an almost daily basis.\nAfter 13 years, the Conservatives are missing in action in the fight against crime. Communities across Quinton, Harborne, Bartley Green and Edgbaston feel under threat. But this is no wonder when the Police have disappeared from our streets and in the West Midlands, the number of neighbourhood PCSO’s have been cut by 40%.\nAlongside an increase in more serious crime, we’re also seeing an uplift in anti-social behaviour. Birmingham City Council and the Police are doing what they can with the limited resources they have. However, you can’t tackle this issue on the cheap.\nAcross Britain, there were 1.1m incidents of anti-social behaviour recorded by police last year, equating to 3,000 incidents a day and our constituency has been made to feel this.\nAs part of Labour’s plan to prevent crime, punish criminals and protect communities, a Labour Government would:\nIntroduce clean up squads for fly-tippers: with tough penalties for fly-tippers and establish clean up squads whereby offenders will clear up litter and vandalism they have dumped. They will be given Fixed Penalty Cleaning Notices that will be managed by the Local Authority.\nStrengthen community sentences: Labour will increase and strengthen the use of community sentences, achieving a double win by tackling reoffending rates and giving a voice directly to victims and local communities.\nSet up Community Payback Boards: The party would also establish Community and Victim Payback Boards in communities where victims and community leaders would oversee community sentences to ensure they are carried out and choose unpaid work that suits the needs of their community.\nWhat the £150 million Conservative catalogue of waste means for our city\nI doubt many people have heard of Government Procurement Cards, but in Parliament, these are the equivalent of debit cards, but instead of spending personal money, they’re funded by the taxpayer. They are used to buy goods and services in shops, over the phone and online, without having to go through normal invoicing procedures.\nIn 2021, almost £150 million was spent using these cards across 14 of the biggest government departments. When the Labour Party looked through records and asked questions to ministers, we found a scandalous catalogue of wasteful and excessive spending.\nTaxpayers’ money being frittered away on luxury furniture, five-star hotels, and four-figure bills in bars and restaurants. Ministers spending thousands of pounds hiring chauffeur services, organising lavish events, and hosting privately catered dinners. Foreign visitors being treated to expensive gifts, lunches and receptions. And Whitehall departments spending small fortunes on corporate branding, expensive away-day venues, and ludicrous training courses.\nThe individual examples are enough to make you so angry, whether it’s Rishi Sunak’s Treasury spending £3,393 on 13 photographs from The Tate Gallery to hang in their office, or Suella Braverman’s media team spending £724 on a four-metre wide 'Panoramic Limestone Background' from an Italian photo company to use as a backdrop for her photos and videos.\nThis would all be unacceptable at the best of times, but during the worst cost of living crisis for decades, it is just unforgivable. Do Tory ministers not know how much people in communities like ours are struggling financially, or do they just not care?\nIf I think of just last week, I had three single mothers who got in touch with me because, through no fault of their own, they now find themselves in a position where they cannot afford to clothe or feed their young children. We are fortunate to have a baby bank in the constituency which provided clothes and formula for the children and my office arranged food bank vouchers and fuel bank vouchers for the mothers. For me, the bigger question is how our society has reached a point that we accept such things as baby banks being a part of our lives and yet, we don’t question when our government fritter away money needlessly like this. We keep being told there is no more money available to support households in situations like that, but we now discover that Liz Truss treated herself to a £3,240 VIP suite at Heathrow to freshen up after a trans-Atlantic flight. This is not right and I for one do not accept or forgive it.\nThese may be called Government Procurement Cards, but the Tories have clearly forgotten that it is the public footing the bill. That cannot continue, and under a Labour government, we will make sure it ends, imposing rigorous new standards across Whitehall and making sure they are enforced. But we should not have to wait until then. If you agree with me, get in touch and let me know, and I will make sure your voice is heard among all those demanding that this gravy train is brought to a stop.\nYou can see full details of Labour’s report into Government Procurement Card spending at www.theGPCfiles.com, and see for yourself all 66,000 items of spending from the 14 Whitehall departments examined.\nRaising my concerns on our crumbling school buildings\nNew figures show 367 of Birmingham's 381 schools will be facing a collective £30.6 million cut to their budgets in 2023.\nThe Department for Education has also reported that the condition of school buildings is a 'significant risk' the Department is managing.\nGiven maintenance of these buildings comes from school budgets, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, has written to all of the headteachers within the constituency to ask about the condition of school buildings and how this will impact learning.\nWhat’s happening around the constituency\nThis week I visited Jiggins Lane Medical Centre to discuss NHS patient care and wider local issues in Bartley Green. It was a helpful conversation and I thank them for all that they do in serving our community.\nIn September last year I visited Wadhurst Road. I met with many residents and spoke about some of the local issues affecting people in this part of the constituency. One of the common asks was if the road could be resurfaced and the potholes filled. I’m please to say this work is now taking place and the road will be returned to a good standard.\nIn Harborne, year 6 students at St Mary’s School have been learning about our constituency and have created some wonderful fact files. I am hoping to visit them soon, to meet with the children and support their learning.\nQuinton will see the award-winning Mobile Household Recycling Centre returning on 2nd March. It will be in place between 7am – 12pm on Overdale Road. If you have any unwanted household waste, please make sure to visit.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Some residents she says, have found alternative means of transportation \"because they cannot any longer justify the cost of the monthly bus ticket when weighing up the reliability of service on offer.\"\nMs Gill also raised concerns of local residents in Edgbaston ward who often face road closures and increased traffic as a result of sporting competitions, including at Edgbaston Cricket Stadium. The local MP expressed her surprise to find that on match days, National Express West Midlands may be failing to increase the number of buses thereby adding to the congestion.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, \"It is crucial that we have a reliable bus service across Birmingham. Our buses are responsible for taking people to work; to healthcare appointments; young people to school and college as well as; moving people across our city, boosting our local economy.\n\"National Express are responsible for a critical public service and when buses do not turn up, or are frequently late, people’s lives are severely impacted. That is why I am looking to meet with them to ensure that our bus services are urgently restored to a higher level of service.\"\nIn her letter, Preet Gill listed five measures she would like to see introduced to improve the service including the implementation of a GPS system on every bus so that bus users can track where each bus is via the app. Technology which isn’t new and already exists.\nThe full letter can be read below:",

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_weekly-update-3-february/content_196.html": "Weekly update - 3 February\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Feb 3, 2023\n- 6 min read\nUpdated: Jan 30, 2024\nThis week the Prime Minister was forced to finally sack the Tory Party Chair, despite it being evident for months he needed to go. It’s disgraceful that the Prime Minister, who claims to be one of integrity, chose to ignore multiple reports about Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs for so long.\nNow, his Deputy Prime Minister is facing at least 24 separate accusations of bullying. Some of the reports are heart-breaking. Still, he sits with the Prime Minister without any action against him.\nThe bigger scandal is that every minute this Government spends distracted by scandal, is yet another minute not spent trying to make our country better.\nWe’ve got a justice system letting murderers walk the streets. Heart attack victims waiting hours for an ambulance. And an economy that is shrinking quicker than the leadership in the Tory Party.\nAnd still, they spend their days defending themselves and putting in place legislation that will restrict the right to strike and that threatens nurses and public sector workers with the sack.\nThis is nothing but a distraction from a Tory Government that’s out of ideas and that’s fast running out of sticking plasters.\nI voted against Rishi Sunak’s ‘Sack the Nurses’ Bill as it is plain wrong and undemocratic. It was a clear and desperate last grasp attempt by this Prime Minister to hold on to power. It is sad for our country that he is just too weak to provide the leadership our country so desperately needs.\nCondemning the destruction of neighbourhood policing\nI condemn the Government’s wholesale destruction of neighbourhood policing. Crime is rising, prosecutions falling and the number of officers on our streets has dramatically declined.\nI want to see the Government put in place a plan to undo the last 13 years of devastation and step up to protect our communities. This must be done by increasing neighbourhood policing, including by ringfencing a proportion of the Police Uplift Programme to deliver neighbourhood officers for every local authority in England and Wales.\nNew figures show the impact of 13 years of Conservative Government that has left the country with 6,000 fewer neighbourhood police officers, 8,500 fewer Police Community Support Officers and over 20 million people who witnessed or experienced antisocial behaviour just last year.\nThese figures, along with the current unfair funding formula, have had a significant impact on the West Midlands which has been disproportionately affected by crime. Our region has seen the number of PCSOs, falling from 1,466 in 2010 to 877 last year and that is despite the Police and Crime Commissioners success in securing the region with additional officers. That is a decrease of more than 40%.\nAfter 13 years, the Conservative legacy is criminals being let off while victims are being let down. Everyone has a right to feel safe and secure in their homes and in their community. But the Conservatives failure means it is the millions of victims that are paying the price.\nAs a mother of two young girls, I know the worry that parents have about their children playing in the park or being targeted online. Knife crime alone has increased in the West Midlands by 115% since 2015. It’s why this question around crime and anti-social behaviour must tackle more than just policing. We must also look at our youth services which have also been decimated.\nIn our constituency of Edgbaston, the Government could have made a big difference by simply granting our levelling up bid. This would have seen Quinton Police Station transformed into a community hub, providing a base for the Police but also giving additional support for youth provision, local training and reskilling. Instead, they once again chose to put party first, country second. The bid was refused and instead, the biggest regional recipients were those where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to losing marginal seats to Labour. That’s not fair or right.\nThe last Labour government cut crime by a third and rolled out neighbourhood policing across the country. The next Labour government will rebuild neighbourhood policing through a £360m package, delivering 13,000 extra neighbourhood officers and PCSOs, putting police back on the beat.\nUnder Labour’s plan, every constituency in England and Wales will get an average of 15-20 additional police on the beat. In Birmingham Edgbaston, this will mean doubling the existing neighbourhood policing capacity.\nLabour will also be tough on the causes of crime, outlawing the grooming of kids for crime, providing mentors for children who are sent to Pupil Referral Units to help get them back on track, and linking youth workers to hospitals and custody suites to reach young people who are becoming involved in gangs as part of a nationwide strategy to tackle youth vulnerability to crime.\nA look around the constituency\nThis week there’s been lots going on in and around the constituency including lots of planning applications and visits from the Mobile Household Recycling Centre.\nI have objected to a planning application in North Edgbaston after hearing concerns from local residents. The application seeks to change a care home into a \"short stay holiday let\" on Portland Road which would accommodate over 50 residents. Given concerns around crime and high levels of existing HMOs, exempt accommodation and hotels already in the area, the MP has lodged an objection.\nSo many of our homes are older properties. I’m receiving lots of residents complaining about damp and mould being caused by poor insulation. I'm campaigning for national change and funding for the council to retrofit homes. In the meantime, the council has shared this useful advice leaflet on controlling condensation and mould, along with a useful video.\nThe land behind Barnsley Road in North Edgbaston was granted planning permission despite residents, councillors and my objections. Now work has begun on site. However, I now have further concerns that the commencement of work on this site has resulted in the potential displacement of a badger sett, which are legally protected animals.\nTherefore, I have recently written to Edgbaston SSL Director, Alex Partakis, which I have also shared with Calthorpe Estates, the Badger Trust, and Birmingham City Council’s Director of Planning. In my letter, I have requested that the site must be checked once again for badger activity, and I implore the developers to hold off on work while they organise these wildlife checks urgently.\nI’ve also joined hundreds of residents in objecting to a planning application on Ridgacre Road West in Quinton. The application seeks permission for the erection of 12 apartments. However, the apartments would be directly against the boundary wall of the M5 and next to an electricity pylon.\nThis planning application shows a complete disregard for residents. No part of this application has residents in mind and will be a blow to the community should it be approved.\nThere is strong feeling in the local community about the impact it will have on parking in the area as well as the impact to those who will live in the property with noise and air pollution both being major issues. Almost 300 residents have come forward to sign a petition against the development.\nAs you can see from the petition, there is strong feeling from neighbours against this development. And they are absolutely right. Who would want to live almost on top of the M5. The noise that will be generated is anti-social and goes against all British Standards for developments like this. It is for these reasons I have written my own letter of objection and residents here have my full support in fighting this application.\nWe also have the Mobile Household Recycling Centre returning to Quinton and Bartley Green. For both visits, the centre will be there between 7am – 12 pm.\nFor Quinton, it will be on Green Lane, B32 1EP, on Thursday 9 February.\nFor Bartley Green, it will be on Longford Close, B32 4JU, on Friday 10 February.\nWill the Government restore funding for WASH as part of the Women and Girls Strategy?\nAs part of my role as shadow cabinet minister for international development, I had the opportunity this week to put a question to the cabinet minister, Andrew Mitchell MP.\nMy question to him set out how we're now past the half-way mark to the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet, on our current trajectory we are set to miss every single one.\nThat’s why I asked the Minister if he'll restore Official Development Assistance for safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as part of the Women and Girls strategy?\nYou can watch me ask my question and the minister’s response above.\nCost of living latest\nThis week we saw Shell posting record profits yet, it is families and individuals across our country that are really now feeling the impact of the cost of living.\nWe know this is going to continue to get worse. The British people are facing an energy price hike of 40% in April. While the government sits back and does nothing, Labour would stop the energy price cap going up in April, because it is only right that the companies making unexpected windfall profits from the proceeds of war pay their fair share.\nOnly Labour is on your side - with a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis now, and a long-term plan to cut bills for good and make Britain a clean energy superpower.\nI have written to all of my constituents explaining Labour’s plans in more detail and sharing my cost of living survey.

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-13-october/content_202.html": "My Weekly Update - 13 October\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Oct 13, 2023\n- 5 min read\nThis week I headed to Liverpool for what should be the last Labour Party Conference before the next General Election.\nConference this year was buzzing with more than 18,000 people in attendance. It was really exciting to feed off the energy of our members, and a fantastic opportunity for me in my new role as a Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Public Health to meet NHS workers, charities, campaigners and service providers as we set out our plans to get the NHS back on its feet.\nWe know it will be hard to turn around the country. But when I see the enthusiasm of the public for that change, I know that we can do it.\nRishi Sunak has conceded the country needs change, and he thinks he can offer that change. But after 13 wasted years, it’s change from the Tories the country needs.\nThat can only happen through a mission-driven Labour Government to rebuild Britain. Keir Starmer can be trusted to change the country because he has changed the Labour Party from the one the public rejected in 2019. This week we set out how we will do that and give Britain its future back.\nDay One\nI joined fellow Jo Cox Women in Leadership Programme alumni, to talk about my journey into politics, the glass ceilings we have left to break, and Jo’s legacy. From the Equal Pay Act to the Equality Act, Labour has a proud tradition of supporting and strengthening women’s rights. From the pay gap to women’s healthcare, the next Labour government will do so again.\nI also attended a series of meetings with SMEs, where I discussed everything from Labour’s skills agenda to Birmingham’s incredible life sciences expertise, before heading to the Terrence Higgins Trust reception to speak about\nLabour’s plans to tackle HIV. The next Labour government could make Britain the first country in the world to end new transmissions of HIV – which is an extremely exciting thought!\nI ended the day with West Midlands Labour and Labour Friends of Bangladesh, and a catch-up with colleagues from some of Labour’s sister parties abroad.\nDay Two\nI joined various panels to speak about the drive to personalise care in the NHS; our shift to prevent as well as treat disease; and another on improving access to care for patients with complex conditions and close regional health inequalities. I also spoke about Labour’s plans to bring back the family doctor, to create a Neighbourhood Health Service, and our rescue packages to fund 2.7 million more appointments a year to bring down waiting lists.\nLater, I also joined a panel event with the Institute for Public Policy Research where I spoke about the link between the health and wealth of the nation. Under the Tories, record numbers of people are off work long-term sick. Inevitably it is older workers, those with the most experience, who we are losing too. The IPPR estimate that just the loss of earnings from 2.6 million people registered as long-term sick could have cost the economy £43 billion in 2021, which is 2% of GDP. The Tories have made us the sick man of Europe. Under Labour we will reform and invest in the NHS to get Britain back on its feet.\nThis day also involved watching Rachel Reeves’ speech in the conference hall; attending a fringe event with Lisa Nandy where we discussed Labour’s plans for a feminist international development policy; and, finally, I dropped in to meet the Labour Convention of Indian Organisations.\nDay Three\nI joined another panel where I shared remarks about Labour’s rescue plan for NHS dentistry, before heading to the main conference hall to see Keir Starmer deliver his speech.\nIt was an incredibly moving illustration of what Keir represents – built on his own lived experience growing up working class and drawing from the stories of people he has met all around the country. His relentless focus on delivering for working people is what sets him apart from Rishi Sunak, who cannot even begin to understand the lives of 99% of the people he serves. His speech was hopeful and made clear what a mission-driven Labour government will deliver: taking back our streets, switching on GB Energy, getting the NHS back on its feet, tearing down barriers to opportunity and getting Britain building again. The next general election can’t come soon enough!\nLater, I spoke at two events. One our plans to streamline access to eye care services. The other joined by Rachel Reeves where we discussed what a Labour government would mean for children. Just as the last Labour government lifted half a million children out of poverty, the next one will do so again. I also had time to whisk around a health showcase to see for myself the patient pathway and how our many wonderful charities and their supporters contribute to the NHS, and squeeze in an hour’s phoning for our wonderful Labour candidate for the Tamworth by-election, Sarah Edwards!\nOn this day, I also joined colleagues from across the Party to attend a vigil for the victims of Hamas’ terrorist attacks. Labour Friends of Israel’s lay chair Adrian Cohen recited Kel Maleh Rachamim and the Chief Rabbi’s Prayer for Israel, concluding with Oseh Shalom Bimromav before a minute’s silence for the victims. It was a profoundly moving event.\nDay Four\nOn my last day, I joined my colleagues in the health team to head to the main hall to hear Wes Streeting’s conference speech on Labour’s health mission. Introducing him was his constituent Nathaniel, a music teacher who spoke about the repeated delays to his treatment for bowel cancer. It was a very moving reminder of what is at stake at the next election.\nAs we set out in the past week, Labour will guarantee millions more appointments, reform and invest in the NHS so it tackles preventable disease and shifts more care to the community, and finally bring down waiting lists so wonderful men like Nat don’t have to wait. I sincerely recommend watching his speech.\nLocal News\nBirmingham City Council Speed Limit Consultation\nBirmingham City Council has opened its consultation around reviewing all existing 40mph speed limits across the city, with the intention that almost all will be revoked, with these becoming 30mph. This includes Wolverhampton Road South, West Boulevard, Barnes Hill, Shenley Lane, and Hagley Road West.\nYou can read more information about this proposal here.\nThe consultation closes on 19 November and I encourage you to have your say, which you can give online here.\nMHRC\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Longford Close, B32 4JU on 17 October and then on 18 October it will be visiting Yateley Road, B15 3JP. The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so please come along if you're local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_what-the-150-million-conservative-catalogue-of-waste-means-for-our-city/content_498.html": "What the £150 million Conservative catalogue of waste means for our city\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Feb 15, 2023\n- 2 min read\nI doubt many people have heard of Government Procurement Cards, but in Parliament, these are the equivalent of debit cards, but instead of spending personal money, they’re funded by the taxpayer. They are used to buy goods and services in shops, over the phone and online, without having to go through normal invoicing procedures.\nIn 2021, almost £150 million was spent using these cards across 14 of the biggest government departments. When the Labour Party looked through records and asked questions to ministers, we found a scandalous catalogue of wasteful and excessive spending.\nTaxpayers’ money being frittered away on luxury furniture, five-star hotels, and four-figure bills in bars and restaurants. Ministers spending thousands of pounds hiring chauffeur services, organising lavish events, and hosting privately catered dinners. Foreign visitors being treated to expensive gifts, lunches and receptions. And Whitehall departments spending small fortunes on corporate branding, expensive away-day venues, and ludicrous training courses.\nThe individual examples are enough to make you so angry, whether it’s Rishi Sunak’s Treasury spending £3,393 on 13 photographs from The Tate Gallery to hang in their office, or Suella Braverman’s media team spending £724 on a four-metre wide 'Panoramic Limestone Background' from an Italian photo company to use as a backdrop for her photos and videos.\nThis would all be unacceptable at the best of times, but during the worst cost of living crisis for decades, it is just unforgivable. Do Tory ministers not know how much people in communities like ours are struggling financially, or do they just not care?\nIf I think of just last week, I had three single mothers who got in touch with me because, through no fault of their own, they now find themselves in a position where they cannot afford to clothe or feed their young children. We are fortunate to have a baby bank in the constituency which provided clothes and formula for the children and my office arranged food bank vouchers and fuel bank vouchers for the mothers. For me, the bigger question is how our society has reached a point that we accept such things as baby banks being a part of our lives and yet, we don’t question when our government fritter away money needlessly like this. We keep being told there is no more money available to support households in situations like that, but we now discover that Liz Truss treated herself to a £3,240 VIP suite at Heathrow to freshen up after a trans-Atlantic flight. This is not right and I for one do not accept or forgive it.\nThese may be called Government Procurement Cards, but the Tories have clearly forgotten that it is the public footing the bill. That cannot continue, and under a Labour government, we will make sure it ends, imposing rigorous new standards across Whitehall and making sure they are enforced. But we should not have to wait until then. If you agree with me, get in touch and let me know, and I will make sure your voice is heard among all those demanding that this gravy train is brought to a stop.\nYou can see full details of Labour’s report into Government Procurement Card spending at www.theGPCfiles.com, and see for yourself all 66,000 items of spending from the 14 Whitehall departments examined.",

When I visited the Polish and Ukrainian border last year, I met so many people fleeing the violence being unleashed and was awestruck by the welcome that Poland had for their neighbours.\nIn the UK, we too have opened our homes to welcome Ukrainian families. But we cannot rest there. We must continue to support those who remain in Ukraine, fighting for freedom, justice and seeking to keep their way of life through humanitarian aid.\nAs Keir Starmer has said, “No one should ever have to face the hardship and loss that the Ukrainian people have over the last year. Their fight for democracy, freedom and liberty in the face of tyranny is also our fight. Standing with our NATO allies, we will ensure Putin's defeat and Ukraine's victory.\"\nSlava Ukraini\nLaunching Labour’s five national missions\nRishi Sunak’s promises are designed to get the Tories through the next few months, and attempt to paper over the cracks the Tories have caused over the last 13 years. They are sticking plaster politics with no ambition for Britain.\nPeople are crying out for a long-term plan to give Britain back its future. This week Keir Starmer launched labour’s five missions for a better Britain which will do just that.\nSo, what are they?\nSecuring the highest sustained growth in the G7 - with good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country making everyone, not just a few, better off.\nMaking Britain a clean energy superpower - to create jobs, cut bills and boost energy security with zero-carbon electricity by 2030, accelerating to net zero.\nBuilding an NHS fit for the future - by reforming health and care services to speed up treatment, harnessing life sciences and technology to reduce preventable illness and cutting health inequalities.\nBreaking down the barriers to opportunity at every stage - for every child, by reforming the childcare and education systems, raising standards everywhere, and preparing young people for work and life.\nMaking Britain’s streets safe by reforming the police and justice system, to prevent crime, tackle violence against women, and stop criminals getting away without punishment.\nI believe that delivering on these five bold missions is how we will restore Britain’s pride and purpose.\nThese missions will set the direction, a clear plan for the years ahead and spell out the fully costed steps to achieving them.\nIt requires everyone to play their part, in every community, in every part of the country. A real partnership between government, national and local, businesses, trade unions and civil society.\nBut to achieve any of this, we must first see a Labour Government elected so that we can build a better Britain.\nFighting for the Number 2 Bus Service\n5,000 bus services have been slashed nationwide since the Conservatives came to power, leaving entire communities cut off by decisions taken far away from the people they affect.\nNo other country in the developed world allows private bus operators the power they enjoy here – to pick what routes they want and charge passengers whatever they wish.\nFares have risen twice as fast as wages. The days of tinkering around the edges of a system that has so clearly failed the public are over. This cannot go on, things must change. And Labour in government will make sure they will.\nWe will put the public back in control of the essential public transport they depend upon. We will give those communities that want it the power to set bus routes and fares, following the path set by our brilliant Mayors in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and in the Liverpool City Region.\nYet, in the West Midlands, it’s clear we’re being left behind by a Mayor who, like his failing Conservative government, talks a good game about bringing in investment and levelling up our region, but where is the delivery?\nIt is simply not acceptable that residents are now faced with a collapsing service of such a basic and fundamental part of our transport infrastructure. Birmingham and the West Midlands deserves a transport system that is fit for purpose. What’s the point in having a Conservative Mayor if he isn’t going to engage with his own Government and stand up for our region?\nBuses are an essential part of people's lives whether that's travelling to work, school or other activities. However, many of our bus services have been under huge threat as passenger numbers have dropped and fuel costs have risen. Last year, I met with National Express West Midlands about the steps they are taking to offer a more reliable service to passengers, and I was encouraged by their actions.\nThis week I've written to Diamond Buses to ask what actions they've taken before simply choosing to cut the 002 service that will have a serious impact on my constituents, in particular in Bartley Green where so many rely on this service.\nI will continue to stand with residents to fight for a reliable public transport service.\nBacking Labour’s plan to bring 20 extra neighbourhood police to every constituency\nShocking new analysis has been released during Labour’s Crime Week which shows huge reductions in staffing for neighbourhood policing in the West Midlands. With this in mind, I have backed Labour’s plans that would see the equivalent of 15-20 extra neighbourhood police in every single constituency.\nLabour has pledged to bring back neighbourhood policing by putting 13,000 more neighbourhood police on Britain’s streets. Labour’s plans are the equivalent of giving every constituency in England and Wales 15-20 extra neighbourhood police - formed of officers, PCSOs, and Specials.\nThe announcement comes as the most recent crime statistics for the West Midlands show a 71% increase in reported robbery since 2015 and more worryingly, knife crime in the West Midlands stands at the highest rate anywhere outside of London with a 115% increase from 2015 to the end of 2022.\nPolicing cannot be done on the cheap – whether in terms of funding or Officer numbers. Fewer Police means victims feel let down, fewer criminals face justice, communities feel under threat and public confidence in the Police falls. In my constituency, residents too often tell me that they never see a police officer on the beat. Given that crime and anti-social behaviour has soared, 20 extra neighbourhood police would double the number of Police across the constituency and reduce crime on a scale that we haven’t seen since the last Labour Government.\nThis is why I wrote to the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman MP, to ask what she would say to my constituents who are deeply fearful for their communities and when my constituency and region will see Police and PSCO numbers increased? I look forward to receiving her response however, I fear that we won’t begin to see any reduction in crime or anti-social behaviour until we have a General Election and secure our next Labour Government.\nWhat’s happening around the constituency?\nThe Mobile Household Recycling Centre is returning to our constituency between 7am-12pm. If you have any household waste to get rid of, please make use of your Labour council’s award-winning service.\n27/02 Waterworks Rd, North Edgbaston, B16 9BJ\n28/02 Trimpley Road, Bartley Green, B32 3PE\n02/03 Overdale Road, Quinton, B32 2QS\n07/03 Metchley Drive, Harborne, B17 0JX\n14/03 Edgbaston Road, Edgbaston, B5 7QU We also have several ward forums coming up.

Our constituency has been fortunate to have two new warm spaces signed up to Birmingham City Council’s programme. If you are in need of a warm space, St Germain's Church in North Edgbaston on Thursdays between 12.30-5.30pm. There is also a new space in Quinton which has joined the programme at Quinton Library on a Monday, Tuesday and Thursday between 10am-1pm.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Congratulations to Keir Mather on a well-deserved win! We’ve seen people put their trust in Labour – many for the first time. Thank you to everyone in Selby and Ainsty that voted for change.\nThis is Labour’s biggest ever by-election victory. Never before has the party overturned a 20,000 majority. This result shows that Labour can win across the country.\nSelby shows how far our changed Labour Party - back serving working people - can go.\nScotland remittances roundtable\nThis week, I visited the Glasgow Central Mosque and Gurdwara Singh Sabha in Scotland with Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, and met with development organisations.\nWe met with local diaspora communities to hear about their experience of sending remittance payments to friends and family abroad as part of the Labour listening event in the city. We also held a roundtable discussion with development organisations in Glasgow. Scotland’s third sector and diaspora communities understand the global challenges we all have in common – chief among them the cost of living crisis – and make an incredible contribution to our country’s role in the world. The £8 billion in remittances that diaspora communities sent overseas last year is solidarity in action.\nHidden fees in remittance payments are a key issue for many diaspora communities in the UK. For families facing a cost of living crisis, this is adding further pressure to households.\nReducing the private costs of remittances is an opportunity to build on the incredible contribution of Britain’s diverse diaspora communities, increase the disposable income of families in the UK, and support our international development goals. Labour will support our diaspora communities and their friends and families abroad.\nRead more about my visit in the Birmingham Mail.\nIn Parliament\nThis week in Parliament, I met Sabrina Elba, UN Goodwill Ambassador for the International Fund for Agricultural Development. We talked about a wide range of issues, with a focus on zero hunger and Britain’s role in international development.\nSabrina and I have much to collaborate on with regards to international development, climate action and poverty eradication. The humanitarian work she does, especially in ensuring food security through her support for small-scale farmers, is vital and totally inspiring. I look forward to working together to support people in developing countries. Given that Sabrina is an inspiration to so many women around the world, it is amazing that she is using her platform to make the case for international development.\nWe also share an appreciation for the diaspora’s contribution to international development, and both believe in a remittances policy that reflects that contribution. The money sent abroad in the form of remittances plays an important role in tackling poverty in developing countries. In Somalia, where Sabrina’s family are from, The World Bank estimates that remittances account for 21.4% of the nation’s GDP.\nIn Parliament\nThis week in Parliament, I made a point of order. I asked the Deputy Speaker if she could advice how I might get a response to my letter, dated 2nd March, to the Immigration and International Development Minister about the ballooning bill of aid for asylum hotels under their watch.\nLast year, donor refugee costs shot up to £3.7bn. The cost per person per night in asylum accommodation has gone up fivefold in four years. And the case backlog still stands at 170,000.\nWaiting four and a half months for a response from the Government is unacceptable.\nDEFRA\nMany constituents have contacted me recently worried about the new financial settlement for the Canal and River Trust. I share their concerns because Birmingham is home to what the Canal and River Trust describe as ‘one of the most intricate canal networks in the world.’\nOur waterways provide access to nature and green spaces that are important to people for life and leisure. Not only this, but they are also a historic part of Birmingham’s rich history. They must be properly maintained and protected for current and future generations.\nTherefore, I have written to the Environment Secretary this week seeking assurances that the new settlement will not result in the decline and closures of rivers, canals, and waterways in Birmingham.\nDownload a copy of my letter below.\nLocal News\nThis week, I visited the students at St. Peter’s Primary School. It was such a pleasure to meet everyone and I’m always glad to hear what’s on the minds of young people in our constituency.\nThe students at St Peter’s asked me amazing questions and I really enjoyed speaking to them.\nI also did a video call to the students from Woodborough Woods about Sikhism and my experience in politics.\nIt was a real joy to see their keen interest in understand what it means to be both a Sikh and a politician. Thank you for the fantastic discussion on faith.\nThis week, I wrote to the Council regarding the implementation of the QE Parking Scheme. Residents living in the areas earmarked for the implementation of parking control measures under the scheme have waited years for action and I am concerned by the slow pace of progress. Therefore, I have written to the Cabinet Member for Transport seeking assurances over the Council’s commitment to deliver the scheme in full. You can download a copy of my letter below.\nMeanwhile, residents of Fountain Road will be aware work has begun on the installation of speed cushions on their road. Work is expected to be complete within the next two weeks. Speeding is, sadly, an issue right across the constituency and every week I am making representations to the Council and the Police on behalf of residents who flag their road as suffering from illegal racing and speeding. I will continue doing all I can to make our roads safe.\nAnother issue raised regularly with me is parking and parking enforcement. This week, after making complaints to the Council about parking around Monument Road, Parker Street, and Hagley Road, I can confirm that a total of 646 PCNs have been issued to vehicles in the first six months of the year for cars parking illegally and obstructively on these roads. I will continue to press for greater parking enforcement across our constituency as I know this is a huge frustration for residents.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

The judge ruled her son needed a special school.\nFor months, she has been trying to get a response from the council to even acknowledge her case.\nWhen she contacted me in July, her son had been out of school since October 2023.\nTo give her son an education, she has been homeschooling him, working 2-3 nights a week while looking after him in the days.\nShe told me this was having an impact on her son’s anxiety as well as her own mental health.\nAs of this week, I have still not heard back from the Council.\nMr Betts, Chloe’s story is just one of dozens of cases I and my team are dealing with, that shows that the current special educational needs and disabilities system is broken.\nI mention Chloe’s story because it is reflective of the sad state of affairs across the country:\n· There has been a 250% increase in appeals to the SEND Tribunal since 2015, with 97% of cases awarded in the favour of parents.\n· Over 20% of students are recorded as ‘persistently absent’.\n· There has been an increase of 33,485 students attending alternative provision and special schools since 2015.\n· And increasing numbers of Local Authorities are unable to fulfil their statutory SEND requirements and are experiencing associated financial unsustainability.\nAs an ex-children’s services manager in Birmingham, I am particularly concerned about the decimation of early years services under the previous government.\nWe need to think more about how we get children ready for school, identify special educational needs early, so we can provide that child the support they deserve.\nChildren with SEND who are being locked out of education are being consigned to a bleak future. That isn’t acceptable.\nI know that the previous Government’s SEND and Alternative Provision (AP) Improvement Plan was an attempt to address some of these challenges. But it did not address the root causes of the current issues, in part because it ignored thousands of consultation responses. As such, it offers only a piecemeal response to this crisis which is leaving too many families without the support they need.\nI hope that with the new government’s Bill we will see meaningful consultation with affected families, and an announcement of funding to go with this in the forthcoming budget, so councils have the resources they need to deal with the huge increase in demand for ECHPs.\nThere are not enough special schools in Birmingham; mainstream schools frequently don’t have the resources to support children with complex needs, and so often, when children’s needs are not identified and responded to early on, they are set back for years at a critical stage in the development, with their parents left to pick up the pieces.\nAs this new government seeks to deliver on its mission to break down the barriers to opportunity, I hope that the Minister will have firmly in her mind people like my constituent Chloe and her son, who deserve much better than the broken system left by the last government.",

We’ve created a Youth Guarantee to get all young people earning or learning.\nAs a result, the first set of statistics under the new Labour government saw an increase in apprenticeship starts, participation and achievement compared to the same period under the Tories.\nHere in Birmingham that meant 9,460 apprentices currently on their course, with 580 having recently completed and 2,080 just beginning on their apprenticeship journey.\nBut we’re not stopping there – as the Chancellor said, we’re going further and faster in our pursuit of growth. Measures set out this week are evidence of that.\nLabour is slashing red tape to ensure providers can focus their time on training the workforce of the future rather than on unnecessary admin.\nWe’re creating shorter apprenticeships to fast-track the skills we need.\nWe’re modernising the apprenticeship journey through the creation of a new app, a one-stop shop for tools and support.\nWe’re creating new apprenticeship standards in the sectors we need to boost to fulfil the government’s missions, like apprenticeships in the green sector.\nCrucially, we’re bringing English & Maths in line with other qualifications, to unlock apprenticeships for up to ten thousand more young people, including here in Birmingham, Edgbaston constituency.\nApprenticeship starts collapsed on the Tories watch, and young people took the biggest hit.\nIt's time to end the snobbery around skills. There was a time when our country valued them, when boosting training was a national priority, when workers got the respect they deserve.\nWe can get back to that golden age and Labour is creating the apprenticeships we need to do so.\nLabour will harness the talents of young people through ambitious reform to power this mission-driven government and our Plan for Change.\nENDS\nNotes for editors\n'Geography Region - starts, achievements, participation, population by age, level' from 'Apprenticeships', Permanent data table - Explore education statistics - GOV.UK",

This historic investment in working people and their communities is the only way out of the high energy bills, energy insecurity, and the doom-loop of low growth, high taxes and crumbling public services under Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives.\n• Labour will switch on Great British Energy, a new publicly owned energy company to take back control of the energy system on behalf of the British people.\nLabour’s Green Prosperity Plan will:\n• Cut energy bills for good, saving families hundreds of pounds on their annual household energy costs.\n• Create up to 650k jobs in every part of the country, including our industrial heartlands and coastal communities.\n• Boost Britain’s energy independence by using our abundant natural resources to free ourselves from the manipulations of Vladimir Putin and petrostates.\n• Deliver climate leadership to protect our children from the threat and costs of the climate emergency.\nMethodology:\n• Modelling by Ember shows that a clean power system would have an annual average household bill saving in 2030 compared to today (Cutting the bills: UK households profit from clean power | Ember (ember-climate.org).\n• Jobs numbers drawn from internal workings based on BEIS and National Grid Future Energy Scenarios and from internal workings based on Construction Industry Training Board projections for the Climate Change Committee’s Sixth Carbon Budget, re-based and re-weighted in line with Labour’s Warm Homes Plan.\n• Estimates for the number of homes upgraded through the Warm Homes Plan in English regions based on Labour analysis and DESNZ Fuel Poverty Statistics England 2024 (2023 data) and DLUCH Energy Performance Certificate data.\n• Energy generation from Local Power Plan projects from Labour analysis.",

Labour’s plan to help tackle one of the key drivers of worklessness before it takes hold, includes:\n· Bringing down waiting times for mental health treatment by recruiting 8,500 new mental health staff\n· Access to specialist mental health support in every school\n· Mental health hubs for children and young people in every community\nLabour has also pledged to:\n· Introduce changes to incapacity benefits to encourage disabled people and people with ill health – who are currently not required to seek work by the benefits system – to try work without fear of losing their income or having to be reassessed if the job doesn’t work out.\n· Overhaul Access to Work, so that people know what equipment, adaptations or personal support they’ll get before they start work – giving them the confidence to take the plunge.\n· Reform job centres and devolving employment support so help is tailored to individual and local need.\nIn Birmingham Edgbaston, 3,636 people now claim Universal Credit health benefits, with the national number up by 400,000 in a year – and Government statistics show that over two thirds of all claims involve mental health problems.\nPreet Kaur Gill has accused the Tories of failing on the economy, because they have failed on work. 2.7 million people, a near record high, are now out of work due to long term sickness; economic inactivity is no longer declining from the post-pandemic high and has instead rebounded to a total of 9.3 million people—the highest in over a decade; and Britain’s employment rate will be lower by the end of this year than forecast in November, and still not back to pre-pandemic levels by 2028- 2029.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston and Labour’s Shadow Minister for Public Health and Primary Care said:\n“A healthy nation is critical to a healthy economy but the Tories have failed on both – and it is places like Edgbaston paying the price. I know from speaking to residents across my constituency the number who are stuck on NHS and mental health waiting lists or locked out of work due to long term sickness – at terrible cost to them and to businesses in our community.\n“The Tories cannot be the change from their own failings. Labour’s plan will tackle the root causes of worklessness by driving down NHS waiting lists, making work pay, and supporting people into good jobs across every part of the country, including right here in Edgbaston.”\nNotes to editors:\nIn December 2022, 2,955 people were claiming Universal credit for health reasons, in December 2023, 3,636 were claiming, an increase of 681\nLabour’s mental health plan is funded by scrapping the carried interest loophole for private equity and the VAT exemption for private schools.\nAccording to the Resolution Foundation, twice as many young people are out of work due to ill-health today than a decade ago, the majority of whom have a mental health disorder.\nLabour analysis of new DWP statistics, using StatXplore, shows that the number of people claiming Universal Credit for health reasons increased in every single parliamentary constituency in Britain between December 2022 and December 2023. The number of people claiming Universal Credit for health reasons rose by an average of 600 last year across constituencies.\nThe same DWP statistics – published earlier this month – found that “2.0 million people were on UC health compared to 1.6 million a year earlier” and “of all WCA decisions in the period January 2022 to November 2023, at least 69% are recorded as having mental and behavioural disorders, albeit this may not be their primary medical condition.\"",

Labour’s plans will not only ensure more workers remain in construction jobs, but that young people are given the opportunity to work in the industry.\nFigures show more than 987,000 young people in the UK are classed at NEET with areas like Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Walsall having rates double the national average.\nLabour’s New Foundation Construction Apprenticeships will give young people aged 16-21 the tools they need for a sustained and rewarding career, with employers given up to £2,000 for every apprentice they take on. The package will see new funding to support Further Education providers in offering industry placements, with tens of thousands of students per year set to gain industry experience.\nThe government will also meet a manifesto promise with new funding for ten Technical Excellence Colleges specialising in construction, as well as an expansion to Skills Bootcamps backed by £100 million of funding.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“This Labour government is serious about its Plan for Change to get Britain building.\n“This fantastic package of support will not only fuel growth but unlock opportunity for young people and allow experienced construction workers to pass on their skills.\n“This will mean more high-quality jobs across Birmingham and the West Midlands, improved economic growth and colleges working closely with local employers to meet their skills needs.”\nENDS",

For years, I have fought against the closure of bank branches and I have continually raised the matter with Ministers. I do so because I believe that my constituents deserve access to professional, in-person, banking support. This is especially important for the elderly, people who are not comfortable using mobile or online banking, and it remains important for small businesses.\nRachel Reeves, Labour’s brilliant Shadow Chancellor, is absolutely right to look at this.\nMeanwhile, on small business, Labour recognises that small business is the beating heart of our economy: breathing life into our high streets; delivering services that make our lives easier; providing the goods we need to thrive. However, often small businesses feel neglected by government, not given the respect their sheer economic weight deserves.\nLabour will end this neglect.\nThe Next Labour Governmnet will legislate to tackle late payments; scrap business rates for a fairer system to reduce the burden on high street premises; boost small business exports by publishing a trade strategy and working alongside the Federation of Small Business on a Small Business Export Taskforce; and provide a fair chance at public contracts to give small and medium businesses fairer opportunities to benefit from public contract bidding.\nIn Parliament\nOn Tuesday, I spoke in a Westminster Hall debate discussing the Draft Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023.\nThe story of these regulations go back to the reforms of the Cameron era which turned competition from one of the ways that the NHS was meant to operate into pretty much the only way.\nAt the time, Labour warned against excessive private involvement in the NHS and said that the marketisation of the NHS would act as a barrier to integration—which is crucial for our ageing population, who often have multiple conditions—and would ultimately lead to a worse service for patients.\nWe were vindicated.\nA decade on from the Cameron era and the NHS is in the middle of the worst crisis in its history, with the highest waiting times and lowest patient satisfaction. It has been left without the staff, equipment or modern technology needed to ensure that patients can be treated on time, and it has slid down the international rankings to the middle of the pack.\nTherefore, Labour welcomes the new regulations which are an extension of the Health and Care Act 2022. The new provider selection regime is as a break from the failed reforms of the last decade and if implemented successfully, we hope that the new regime will simplify health procurement, saving time and money.\nWatch my contribution below.\nPolitics Live\nAlso on Tuesday, I joined the BBC Politics Live team in London to discuss the Elgin Marbles debate, and Labour's plan for the NHS.\nThis week the Greek Prime Minister came to London, only to be humiliated by our Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, looking to throw a fit over the Elgin Marbles, cancelling at the last minute rather than standing up and talking about important security, the economy and immigration issues with this important ally. In stark contrast to Mr Sunak, Keir Starmer used the opportunity to meet with the Greek Prime Minister to discuss these important issues.\nMeanwhile on the NHS, a record seven million people are waiting for NHS treatment and they are waiting longer than ever before, often in pain and discomfort. People are finding it impossible to get a GP appointment, cannot access NHS dentistry, face long waits for mental health care, and there are thousands of unavoidable deaths every year.\nAs I say on the show, reform is not just about where you put money, it’s also about where you target the support. That is why Labour will shift towards a prevention first policy, because early intervention saves lives and saves money. That means moving treatment to our communities, exploring how technology can free up NHS workers to focus on care, and ensuring education develops the creativity, resilience and curiosity young people need in a modern world.\nUnder Labour, the country will benefit from a 10-year plan for change and modernisation of the NHS, including one of the biggest expansions of the NHS workforce in history, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status.\nThe longer we give the Conservatives in power, the longer patients wait. We need change and we need a Labour Government.\nWorld AIDS Day\nThis week, I also had the pleasure of joining the Let Communities Lead panel with STOPAIDS for World Aids Day. This panel being part of a broader conference for World Aids Day, this year’s conference titled ‘Community and UK leadership in the Global HIV Response’.\nWorld AIDS Day was first celebrated on 1st December 1988 as an international day to raise awareness of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV and to mourn those who had died from the disease and related illnesses.\nOver the past 20 years since it was established under the last Labour government, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has saved 50 million lives.\nMeanwhile, thanks to incredible advances in treatment, HIV-positive people can live freely and love freely. But there is still work to do.\nThe next Labour government will continue the fight to end new cases of HIV in the UK by 2030.\nAction Smoking & Health\nIt was similarly lovely to meet with Action Smoking & Health this week, to discuss cracking down on youth vaping and how we can secure a smoke-free future.\nWhile we recognise the role vaping can play in helping people to quit smoking, it is not risk free and I am alarmed at the rapid rise in underage vaping. I know this is also of concern to constituents, some of whom have written to me in recent months about this.\nIn the West Midlands, it is estimated that 23 percent of secondary-school children have tried vapes.\nWe cannot sit back and allow a new generation of kids to get hooked on nicotine. The health impacts on our children are seriously worrying and health leaders have sounded the alarm.\nThat is why Labour will come down like a ton of bricks on underage vaping and ban the marketing of vapes to children, to give every child a healthy start to life.\nLocal News\nGurpurab\nOn Monday, I had the honour of joining my local congregation of our annual nagar kirtan.\nSri Guru Nanak Dev Ji was born in 1469, he gave the world a spiritual path that combines personal and community spirituality with selfless service to the world.\nGuru Nanak’s Gurpurab falls during the 16 days of activism to end gender-based violence. Guru Nanak was a strong advocate for gender equality and raised his voice on discrimination against women. Guru Nanak’s message of equality must be made a reality by us all.\nThree principles of Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s teachings: Kirat Karo (honest living), Naam Japo (devotion to God) and Vand Chhako (sharing with others) have become an integral part of the lives of Sikhs all over the world. Playing our part to make the world safer, and equal.\nI hope all Sikhs in Edgbaston had a Happy Gurpurab!\nIlleybrook Square\nOn Thursday, I was provided an update from Birmingham City Council regarding redevelopment plans for Illeybrook Square in Bartley Green. This area has long needed to be better utilised and I have received concerns in the past from residents wanting to know what the future holds for Illeybrook Square.\nWhile it’s early days, I am grateful to the Council taking the time to update me and I will continue to share news with constituents when information is available.\nMHRC\nThe Mobile Household Recycling Centre will visit our constituency again next week. First, on 6 December at Glyn Road (B32 2TA). And again on Friday 8 December at Arosa Drive (B17 0SE). The centre will be open from 7am to 12:30pm. Please come along if you're local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nWarm Welcome Spaces\nLast year, hundreds of spaces were made available across Birmingham for people to meet and engage in all sorts of activities. This time of year can be challenging, both financially and emotionally, and therefore I wish to encourage anyone who is facing a difficult time to reach out for support.\nFind a Warm Welcome Space in Birmingham near you: here.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Now, with funding from the Labour government, they are able to offer a healthy start for children and 30 minutes of childcare before the school bell rings.\nAs well as offering a healthy breakfast of fruit, toast and cereal, the school also put on activities for children attending the breakfast club. Parents will be able to save up to £450 per year if their child attends free breakfast clubs every day.

Analysis shows our new laws will wipe over £70 million off the cost of uniform for families across the country. Read more here.\nImmigration\nWith West Midlands Police\nOur government has announced that foreign sex offenders will be excluded from refugee protections.\nAt present, the Refugee Convention entitles countries to refuse asylum to terrorists, war criminals and individuals convicted of a ‘particularly serious crime’ who present a danger to the community – defined in the UK as an offence carrying a sentence of 12 months or more.\nFor the first time, any conviction of a crime that qualifies a foreign national for the sex offenders register will lead to them being denied refugee status, toughening our approach to border security through stricter enforcement of the rules.

The decision will keep the cost of a prescription to a tenner, at £9.90 for a single charge.

We will tackle soaring fly-tipping and clean up Britain’s streets, lanes and rural areas by getting councils to work with the police to identify, seize and crush vehicles of waste criminals. Drones and mobile CCTV cameras will be deployed to identify cars and vans belonging to fly-tippers so they can be destroyed.\nIn addition, waste cowboys will now face up to five years in prison for operating illegally.

The maximum amount that can be taken from someone’s Universal Credit standard allowance payment to repay debt has been 25% – but from today the Government has reduced it to 15%.\nOur plan for change is easing the cost of living and putting more money into the pockets of working people.

This price is set independently of the government, reflecting changes in wholesale prices and global markets.\nIn response, Labour is acting to protect families in the West Midlands by bringing forward plans to expand the Warm Home Discount, giving eligible households £150 off their energy bills. This would bring a total of nearly 2.7 million households into the scheme across the country – pushing the total number of households that would receive the discount next winter up to an estimated 6.1 million.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said:\n“This announcement from Labour will make a real difference to families in my constituency who are struggling to pay their energy bills.\n“Labour is determined to secure our energy system, protect it from the rollercoaster of fossil fuel markets and give working people the security they deserve.\n“Through our mission for clean power, and the support announced today, this Labour government is putting money back in the pockets of working people.”\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband said:\n“Labour is determined to do everything we can to protect families from the grip of fossil fuel markets. Expanding the Warm Home Discount can help protect millions of families from rising energy bills, offering support to consumers across the country.\n“This Labour Government will always stand up for working people.\n“Through our clean power mission we are determined to deliver energy security and bring down bills for good, with homegrown clean power that we in Britain control.”\nLabour is also accelerating proposals to introduce a debt relief scheme, which would target unsustainable debt built up by households in the West Midlands during the energy crisis. This would help to cut the costs of servicing bad debt, which currently contributes to higher bills for all billpayers. Under these plans, the target would be to reduce the debt allowance to pre-crisis levels, with Ofgem estimating that these plans could lower these costs by £25-30 per year.\nThis additional support for households across the West Midlands complements the government’s mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower, delivering energy security and bringing down bills for good. The expected rise in the price cap shows once again the cost of remaining reliant on the unstable global fossil fuel markets that are driving price increases. Three years on from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, wholesale gas prices have now risen by 15% compared to the previous price cap period, which is directly affecting the cost of generating power and heating of homes. Moving to a power system based on homegrown, clean energy will reduce the UK’s reliance on volatile markets and protect billpayers.\nWhile Labour presses on with our clean power mission, swift action has already been taken to shield energy consumers from high prices. These measures include:\nExtended the Household Support Fund to provide help through local councils to struggling households with essential costs, including energy bills.\nWorked with energy suppliers to negotiate a £500 million winter support package for consumers.\nRolled out the next steps of the Warm Homes Plan, which will upgrade 300,000 homes this financial year.\nConsulting on boosting living standards in the private rented sector by requiring all private landlords in England and Wales to meet Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) C or equivalent in their properties by 2030, which will help a million renters out of fuel poverty.\nAnnounced a comprehensive review of the energy regulator Ofgem, empowering it to facilitate growth and innovation and become a stronger champion for consumers.\nDriving forward with pro-consumer reforms:\nChallenging unlawful back billing; taking action on inaccurate bills.\nDriving the smart meter rollout.\nGiving every family the option of a zero standing charge tariff, so they have more choice in how they pay for their energy.\nEnsuring compensation for wrongful installation of prepayment meters.\nENDS\nNotes to editors\nFurther information on the Warm Home Discount scheme can be found here: Warm Home Discount Scheme: Overview - GOV.UK\nOfgem’s consultation on establishing a debt relief scheme closed on Thursday 6 February.

Convictions for criminal people smuggling have plummeted by 36 per cent since 2010. At the same time, more than 45,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats facilitated by criminal gangs – up from 300 in 2018, a more than hundredfold increase in the space of four years.\nThe Illegal Migration Act also cancels asylum decision making with no return agreements in place. This means it will just increase the asylum backlog with even more people in costly hotels.\nLabour will reform the asylum system. We will:\n1. Crack down on criminal smuggler gangs, through a new Cross-Border Police Unit\n2. Clear the backlog and end hotel use\n3. Reform resettlement routes to stop people being exploited by gangs\n4. Sign a new agreement with France and other countries on returns and family reunion\n5. Tackle humanitarian crises at source, helping refugees in their region\nBBC Radio West Midlands\nThis week on BBC Radio West Midlands, I responded to Rishi Sunak’s out-of-touch suggestion that “it’s not the Government’s job” to bail out Birmingham City Council.\nThe cost of living crisis has meant that people rely on council services more than ever. The Government must not abandon Birmingham's residents, especially after it has taken nearly £1bn from the council's budget in austerity cuts.\nLocal economies matter. They impact nationally. The Government’s funding plan takes no account of austerity or the squeeze on living standards.\nThe council is not asking for a bailout. It is asking for leadership from this government to ensure that essential services are delivered.\nTicket Office Closures\nThis week, I have been campaigning to keep our ticket offices open at University Station and Five Ways.\nI have written to the Government and West Midlands Trains opposing the closure of ticket offices and, this week, I submitted my comments to the ongoing consultation.\nBoth Five Ways and University Station are key stations which rely on well-functioning services. University Station, one of the busiest in the city, is particularly important as it provides citizens with essential access to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham Women’s Hospital and the University of Birmingham. Many people passing through University Station will be vulnerable, and many elderly and disabled. For those users, digital ticketing alternatives can present a challenge.\nPassengers have suffered enough on our railways. The last thing they need is more disruption.\nThe ticket office consultation has now been extended to 1st September. Have your say by writing to Transport Focus at the freepost address: RTEH-XAGE-BYKZ, PO Box 5594, Southend-On-Sea, SS1 9PZ, or by e-mailing ticketoffice.WMT@transportfocus.org.uk\nLocal News\nPolice\nThis week, I have been in contact with the police after residents expressed concerns about quad bikes and off-road motorcycle use in Edgbaston.\nI submitted a freedom of information request to West Midlands Police after receiving multiple complaints from residents, and the police have assured me that they are taking action to tackle this problem. They told me that they have been able to identify 11 quad bikes recovered in Birmingham in the last 12 months. I was also informed that in just one operation, they seized three motorbikes, recovered a stolen moped and reported people for offences including driving without insurance, failing to stop for police and other driving offences.\nIt’s good to see the police working to combat this issue. If you have any concerns about quad bikes and off-road motorcycle use, please do call my office at 0121 392 8426 between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday or e-mail me at preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk.\nVirgin Media Broadband\nThis week, Virgin Media assured me that its team is working closely on the network in Edgbaston to ensure services are working seamlessly. After such prolonged broadband issues, I’m glad to see that Virgin Media is taking action to resolve this problem. Please contact me if you have any concerns.\nMHRC\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Melville Road, North Edgbaston, B16 9JT, on Monday 31st July, Woodville Road, Quinton, B17 9AR, on Wednesday 2nd August, and Clapgate Lane Shopping Centre, Bartley Green, B32 3DH, on Thursday 3rd August. The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so please come along if you're local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBirmingham Festival 23\nBirmingham Festival 23 starts this week! From this Friday, there will be 10 days of free live music, performance, and activities. There are events that cater to everyone, and loads of daytime activities for children on school holidays.

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_preet-kaur-gill-mp-my-weekly-update-28-february/content_122.html": "Preet Kaur Gill MP - My Weekly Update - 28 February\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Feb 28\n- 9 min read\nUpdated: Mar 5\nCrime and Policing Bill\nOn Tuesday, we brought forward one of the biggest legislative updates to policing for decades with our Crime and Policing Bill.\nOur bill includes measures to address the highest-harm crimes impacting society, such as knife crime, violence against women and girls, cybercrime, child sexual abuse and terrorism. It also gives police new powers against theft of mobile phones – no longer needing a warrant to search properties where stolen items have been electronically geolocated.\nOur bill will treat violence against women and girls as the national emergency it is, strengthen Stalking Protection Orders, introduce a new criminal offence covering spiking and bar registered sex offenders from changing their name where they continue to pose a threat.\nThe bill places significant focus on protecting high streets. There will be increased powers to crack down on repeat antisocial behaviour offenders, with new Respect Orders banning those prolific offenders from our town centres. Police will also be given the power to seize vehicles that cause havoc to communities, allowing them to deal with the scourge of off-road bikes in public parks and dangerous e-scooters on pavements.\nAs Parliamentary Chair of the Co-operative Party, I’m glad the Government is taking forward a Co-operative and Usdaw campaign and creating a specific offence for assault against retail workers. The effective immunity for shop theft of goods below £200 will also be scrapped. You can read more about what the bill will do here.\nPM Keir Starmer meeting with President Trump\nYesterday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer had a very successful meeting with US President Donald Trump in the White House.\nThe leaders discussed their special relationship between their two nations and their commitment to shared security and prosperity. They also spoke about the fair, balanced and reciprocal economic relationship that the two countries enjoy, and agreed their teams should work together to deepen this relationship, and to work to agree a trade deal focussed on tech.\nThe leaders agreed that on Ukraine, talks must work towards a lasting peace. The Prime Minister said the UK is ready to play a leadership role on supporting Ukraine’s future security.\nThe President also accepted an invitation on behalf of His Majesty the King for an unprecedented second State Visit to the United Kingdom. Read more about the visit here.\nNational Security\nWe are facing a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our country and our continent. Global instability, Russian aggression in Ukraine, increasing threats from malign actors, climate change and rapid technological disruption have all contributed to a rapidly deteriorating security landscape.\nResolving the Ukraine crisis through protecting its sovereignty is imperative for European security. On the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine, we have stepped up our support. We committed to boosting military aid, extending the UK’s training programme for Ukrainian troops, and have announced the largest sanctions package against Russia since 2022.\nAs a leading European power, the UK must step up to safeguard continental security on an enduring basis. That is why this Labour Government is increasing defence investment to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027.\nYou can read Keir Starmer’s full speech here.\nGPs\nOutside University Hospitals Birmingham\nRebuilding our broken NHS starts with GPs. I’m thrilled that our government has agreed a new deal for GPs – the first since the pandemic.\nBy slashing red tape, we will free up GPs and take the first steps to end the 8am scramble for appointments. We will modernise general practice by requiring surgeries to allow patients to request appointments online, freeing up the phones for those who need them most.\nWe will also bring back the family doctor, enabling patients to request to see their regular doctor for each appointment, backed by the biggest funding boost for General Practice in years. You can read more here.\nDentistry\nAfter 14 years of Conservatives, it has become near impossible to get an NHS dental appointment. Statistics show that around 1 in 4 patients who tried to see an NHS dentist in the past 2 years were unable to do so.\nThis government is delivering on its mission to provide 700,000 extra urgent dental appointments, with a target of 9,000 appointments in Birmingham. We will rebuild dentistry – focusing on prevention, retention of NHS dentists and reforming the NHS contract to make NHS work more appealing to dentists and increase capacity for more patients. You can read more here.\nWater\nThis week, we passed a new law banning bonuses for water bosses who pollute our rivers, lakes and seas.\nThe Water (Special Measures) Act 2025 will give regulators new powers to take tougher and faster action to crack down on water companies damaging the environment and failing their customers. You can read more about the Act here.\nThis is just the beginning. The Government is inviting the public, environmental groups, investors and others to have their say on future changes to the water sector. The Independent Water Commission will report back later this year to shape new laws that will transform our water system so we can clean up our rivers, lakes, and seas for good. Find out more and send in your comments here.\nSkills England\nThis week, I voted to create Skills England, to support local areas to develop the skilled workforces they need. Our plans will kickstart economic growth, by opening up new opportunities for young people and enabling British businesses to recruit more home-grown talent.\nAhead of the vote, I met with Phil Smith, Chair of Skills England, to discuss pathways into work in the West Midlands. Together, we can address the skills gaps we have in our region by ensuring partners work together.\nWith Skills England Chair Phil Smith\nGrenfell Inquiry\nMy comments on the Grenfell Inquiry Phase 1 report to Hits Radio last September\nThe Government has responded in full to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, setting out tough new reforms to fix building safety and strengthen accountability. We have accepted the report’s findings and will take action on all of the 58 recommendations in the report.\nThis means greater accountability, stronger regulation, and putting residents at the heart of decision-making to make sure no community will ever have to face a tragedy like Grenfell ever again.\nI know the Government’s commitment to reforming building safety will be welcomed by my constituents who are waiting for vital upgrades to unsafe homes. Last year, we introduced a Remediation Acceleration Plan, which includes new measures to get buildings fixed quicker, ensures rogue freeholders are held to account, and puts the end in sight for affected residents. You can read the Government’s full response to the inquiry here.\nHospices\nFamilies across England will start to see improved end-of-life care as the Government brings in major upgrades to hospice services nationwide.\nI’m delighted that Birmingham Hospice will receive an additional £345,224, as part of the largest investment in hospices in a generation.\nBirmingham Hospice does a wonderful job providing support for people with life-limiting conditions and their loved ones. This funding will go towards modernising facilities, improving IT systems and ensuring patients receive the highest quality care. You can read more here.\nDigital Inclusion Action Plan\nWith Prime Minister Keir Starmer\nMillions of people in Britain are set to gain greater digital skills to help boost economic growth and success.\nWith daily tasks like speaking to a GP, applying for jobs, or renting and buying a house becoming increasingly digitalised, improved digital skills and access to technology are essential for people to access vital services and boost their employability.\nOur Digital Inclusion Action Plan includes funding for local initiatives targeted to the most digitally-excluded groups, including the elderly and low-income households. We will also partner with inclusion charity Digital Poverty Alliance to provide laptops to people who are digitally excluded. Read more about our plans here.\nPension Credit\nOn the campaign trail\nFigures published this week reveal nearly fifty thousand extra pensioners are now receiving vital Pension Credit support following a surge in claims processed.\nStats show the DWP is processing record number of claims a week, bringing down outstanding applications and giving the poorest pensioners vital support.\nTo apply for Pension Credit or check if you’re eligible, you can apply online, call on 0800 99 1234, or print out and fill in the Pension Credit claim form (or call the claim line to request a form) and post to: Freepost DWP Pensions Service 3.\n3D Guns\nWith West Midlands Police officers\nThis week, I was glad to see that the West Midlands Police Federation welcomed my work on criminalising the blueprints for 3D-printed guns.\n3D guns are increasingly presenting themselves as a threat to our safety and security and as organised crime changes, legislation must keep up.\nAfter presenting a bill to make it illegal to possess and share the templates for 3D guns, I’m glad that the government has taken this forward and that these measures are now making their way through Parliament. Read more here.\nYou can watch the Channel 4 Documentary I featured in on 3D-printed guns here.\nEnergy Bills\nExplaining Labour's vision for Great British Energy on Politics Live\nWe are protecting families in the West Midlands who are struggling to pay their energy bills. It’s great news that 270,000 more families in our region will be able to receive the Warm Homes discount to help them to deal with an unpredictable energy market next winter. Read more here.\nThe Government has also provided a webpage with information about rising bills and useful resources for those who seek support with their energy bills, here.\nCommunity Britain\nThis week, the Co-operative Party launched Community Britain, a campaign recognising the people and places that bring pride to communities, and the serious solutions they offer to our politics and our country.\nThe Party has also reached out to community leaders, experts and representatives around the country and produced an essay collection, Stories from Community Britain, that showcases the communities across the country who are pioneering solutions to important issues like climate change, economic stagnation and social cohesion. You can read more and find the essay collection here.\nCo-op Live: International Development\nIt was great to speak on a Co-op Live panel about International Development on Thursday evening.\nAs former Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, Britain's’ proud legacy on development is one that I cherish dearly. Our country has a proud history of tackling poverty, improving food security and limiting the worst effects of climate change in all corners of the globe.\nGreater Birmingham Chamber of Commerce Awards\nAt the Greater Birmingham Chamber of Commerce awards ceremony\nLast night, it was great to attend the Greater Birmingham Chamber of Commerce Awards 2025, opened by fantastic CEO Henrietta Bailey and Mayor Richard Parker.\nOver 1,000 people attended to celebrate the contribution of diverse businesses in our city and region. It was also a pleasure to see some of the region’s brilliant up and coming arts and culture talent showcased at the ceremony.\nLocal News\nBreakfast Clubs\nWith Bridget Philipson, Secretary of State for Education\nI’m delighted that three schools in my constituency - Nonsuch Primary School, St Patrick and St Edmund’s Primary School and World’s End Infant and Nursery School – are early adopters to the Government’s free breakfast club scheme.\nThis government is removing the barriers to opportunity by making sure every child starts the school day ready to learn.\nWith students from St Patrick and St Edmund's, who won an award for their breakfast club\nWestbourne Centre\nOn a visit to the Westbourne Centre\nIt was great to visit the Westbourne Centre, a healthcare facility, in my constituency.\nI toured facility and met with consultants, nurses, and staff to learn more about how they are delivering patient care in the community and support the NHS.\nBrsk\nI was glad to have the opportunity to represent constituents in a meeting with Brsk, raising concerns about new infrastructure being deployed only via poles and in areas where they are not needed.\nResident’s voices must be heard. I will continue to work with residents, the council, the government and broadband providers to find solutions collectively.\nI spoke in a debate about the rollout of broadband infrastructure, you can watch it here.\nJob Club at Brandwood Centre\nThe Brandwood Centre have announced their next job club will take place at the centre on Monday, 3rd March, from 9:30am to 11:30am.\nTheir volunteer mentors will be available to support participants with job search tips and advice, guidance on writing covering letters, and crafting the perfect application. If you’re interested, send your name, contact number, and email address to alison@brandwoodcentre.co.uk.\nMissed Bins\nConstituents have contacted me to say that their bin collections have been missed. You can report missed collections here.\nMHWC\nNext Friday, 7th March, the MHWC will be visiting Meadow Road in Harborne, B17 8BN. The centre will be open between 7:30pm and 1pm, so please do come along if you have any bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

We are already delivering on promises we made at the General Election - here are just a few of the ways that Labour is making working people better off.\nImproved incomes for working people\nLabour has increased the minimum wage for three million low-paid workers, and committed to retaining the pension triple lock for 13 million state pensioners.\nResolved long-running industrial disputes\nThe Government has ended a number of long-running strikes, including for junior doctors and rail operators.\nFast-tracked legislation to improve workers' rights\nOne of the government's first pieces of legislation honoured our manifesto promise to reverse decades of erosion of people's rights at work. The Employments Rights Bill, with well over 100 clauses, passed its second reading in October. It will bring reform on issues including flexible working, family-friendly policies, unfair dismissal, equality at work, fair pay and give employees more of voice at work. The Bill will create a new national Adult Social Care Negotiating Body. The Bill will give the Secretary of State new powers and staff to enforce Labour market legislation.\nRestored NHS funding\nThe NHS faces major challenges. The service already accounts for a fifth of all public spending, and it faces growing demand from an ageing and sicker population. The government has restored NHS spending to its highest level since 2010. This is to fund 40,000 additional elective appointments, investment in technology, and the creation of new mental health crisis centres. Lord Darzi’s report, commissioned by the government and delivered in record time, has prepared the ground for the launch of a major long-term plan for the NHS in 2025. Darzi makes a clear case for shifting resources from hospitals to primary care.\nLaunched housing and planning reform – including greater security for tenants\nWe face a chronic shortage of homes, causing sky-high rents for tenants. Ever-rising house prices are increasingly driving young people out of the market and quashing the dream of home ownership.\nThis government has set ambitious housebuilding targets and intends to impose those on local authorities if necessary. It also proposes to overhaul planning processes. Over decades, right-to-buy policies have led to a dramatic decline in social housing and a consultation on reform closed on 15 January. The Renters Rights Bill will provide a major overhaul of the private rented sector with greater security for tenants and new enforcement powers for local authorities.\nLabour will create planned New Towns. A New Towns Taskforce has been created with a mandate to identify sites for 12 new towns by this summer, and they have issued a call for local authorities to propose suitable locations.\nLegislated to improve the regulation of the water industry\nConservative privatisation policies failed in the case of the water industry, where there has been growing public concern about increased charges, flooding, and sewage being dumped in our rivers and beaches.\nThe water companies have been failing in their duties and in managing their finances. The costs of restoring the system are huge. A first step to address public concern is the Labour government’s Water Special Measures Bill. This will enable the Regulator to block bonus payments to water company executives, improve pollution reporting, and allow imprisonment for obstructing investigations\nLaunched a major devolution of powers to local government\nWe have one of the most centralised systems of local government in the developed world, with most policy decisions made by people based in offices far from those who it might affect. In December, the English Devolution White Paper set out plans for the most comprehensive restructuring of local government since 1974, and a process for progressively devolving power from Whitehall to local mayors. Local authorities have been invited to indicate how quickly they expect to produce plans.\nImproved international relations\nInternational issues have a major bearing on the lives of people in Britain. The conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have meant higher energy prices, security concerns, and increased migration. In an increasingly unstable world, we need to strengthen our trade and defence alliances. It’s right that the Prime Minister is seeking to re-build relationships and our reputation on the world stage.\nLaunched a strategic defence review\nThe government has committed to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, reflecting rising global tensions and the increasing complexity of defence issues. Conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa have demonstrated the changing shape of warfare itself. A major Strategic Defence Review, launched in August with widespread consultation, will report in the first half of 2025.\nStrengthened environmental policies\nAt COP29 in November, Keir Starmer unveiled new aspirations for the UK's environmental policy, including the creation of Great British Energy, with an £8.3bn fund to speed up the development of green technologies. The ban on land-based windfarms has been lifted and a ban has been introduced on new gas and oil exploration in the North Sea. A record number of clean energy projects have been approved and new regional clusters have been created to develop carbon capture, usage, and storage.\nLaunched improvements to public transport\nThe unreliability and high cost of rail and bus travel drives road congestion, creates pollution, and is a drag on economic activity.\nThere is public support for renationalising the railways, and the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Act 2024 has become law, setting the process in motion alongside the creation of Great British Railway. The Government has also increased the powers of local authorities to shape rail and bus services. The government has committed £1bn to improve bus services and has capped single bus fares at £3. The Bus Services Bill will give local authorities new controls over routes, timetables, connections and fares.\nStrengthened police response to violence against women and girls\nThe Government has launched a number of measures to reduce violence against women and girls. They include a Safer Streets Mission Board to coordinate this across government. It is also piloting new Domestic Abuse Protection Notices and Domestic Abuse Protection Orders in five areas, and is embedding domestic abuse specialists in 999 call centres.\nStrengthened border control and increased returns of failed asylum seekers\nAlthough more than 95% of immigrants arrive with government approval, the government has mandated the Migration Advisory Committee to work with Skills England, the Industrial Strategy Council, and the Department of Work and Pensions, to monitor the use of skills visas and reduce employers’ dependence on imported labour. UK Visas and Immigration have been mandated to increase investigations to tackle visa abuse.\nResources freed by the cancellation of the Rwanda deportation scheme are being used to speed up the process of removing failed asylum seekers, aided by new bilateral agreements with some countries of origin, and return numbers have increased. A series of measures have also been introduced to restrict the ability of people-smugglers to do business in the UK, and work is in hand with European countries to coordinate detection and prosecution.\nOther actions\nThere is so much more that we have done, and this is just the beginning. Here's a handful of some of the other things that we have achieved since we were elected:\nAllocated £11.8bn for infected blood compensation.\nAllocated £3bn more for Ukraine.\nAllocated £500m to local Warm Home grants.\nAllocated an additional £550m for pothole repair.\nAppointed a Covid Counter-Fraud Commissioner.\nCreated a cross departmental Child Poverty Taskforce.\nCreated Skills England to reform training and apprenticeships. Created the Women’s Justice Board.\nLaunched Domestic Abuse Protection Orders.\nLaunched legislation to remove hereditary Peers from the House of Lords.\nPiloting free breakfast clubs in 750 schools.\nPiloting new training for community policing. Plan to recruit 6,500 more teachers.

It is therefore critical that students are properly supported while at university.\nThe data shows Higher Education providers have work to do to ensure first-year students are promptly and properly supported through health and well-being support.\nPreet therefore asked whether Edgbaston universities would voluntarily publish an annual report that provides an assessment of the quality of health and wellbeing support services on offer as well as publishing annually the suicide rate among enrolled students, and what more we can do to bring about change.\nSee Preet's letter below.\nIf you have questions or concerns regarding universities, student wellbeing, or mental health support then please write to Preet on preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk or telephone 0121 392 8426.",

Now, 1 in every 9 people in England are on the NHS waiting list equating to 6.6 million people.\nThe Conservative Government published its elective care recovery plan for the NHS this week but failed to set out how it would address the workforce shortages the NHS is facing. The plan set the Government’s ambition as beginning to reduce waiting lists from 2024.\nCommenting, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said:\n“I wrote to the health secretary twice following concerns that West Midlands Ambulance Service was close to complete collapse and raising questions regarding NHS services. The response which arrived more than two months later, was woefully lacking; and failed to address how the Government will tackle the root causes to put the NHS back on track.\n“Now, record numbers of people in my constituency of Birmingham Edgbaston are waiting longer than ever before, often in pain and distress.\n“Our local health care staff worked heroically throughout the pandemic, but they have been stretched like never before and as the Culture Secretary admits, a decade of Conservative mismanagement left the NHS “wanting and inadequate”, and patients are now left to wait too long as a result. Our NHS is crying out for a change in government to give us the fresh start we need.”\nWes Streeting MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said: “One in every nine people is now waiting for NHS care, and they are waiting longer than ever before.\n“Hundreds of thousands of patients have now been waiting for care through three Conservative Health Secretaries. The only discussion of the NHS in the Conservative leadership election seems to be about how much they plan to cut it by. We may have a new Prime Minister in two months’ time, but only a Labour government will give Britain the fresh start it needs.\n“Labour will rebuild our NHS with the staff, equipment and modern technology needed to treat patients on time again.”\nENDS\nNotes to Editors:\nSource: Consultant-led Referral to Treatment Waiting Times Data 2021-22\nPopulation figure source: ONS Population estimates for the UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland: mid-2020\nLetter to health secretary from Preet Kaur Gill MP: Preet Gill MP describes Health Secretary response to ambulance times as ‘woefully lacking’ (preetkaurgill.co.uk)",
  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-1-september/content_221.html": "My Weekly Update - 1 September\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Sep 1, 2023\n- 5 min read\nUpdated: Jan 30, 2024\nThis week, the news has broken that dozens of schools are set to be partially or wholly closed in the next few days by the Department for Education because they are literally crumbling.\nThis is a staggering display of Tory incompetence as they start a fresh term by failing our children again. Dozens of England’s schools are at risk of collapse with mere days before children return to classrooms.\nTo make matters worse, the Minister for Schools said he’d be “happy for his nieces and nephews to be sat in a classroom propped up by beams to keep it standing”.\nChildren sat underneath steel girders to protect them from the ceiling falling in: the defining image of thirteen years of a Conservative-run education system.\nThis broken government ignored the warnings. They have given up. I wrote to schools in February asking headteachers to write to me about the conditions of their schools and how they think students will be affected without these repairs being addressed. Download my letter here:\nLabour knows that children can’t get a first class education in a second class school. The next Labour government will ensure schools are fit for purpose and children are safe.\nLabour will reform the education system. We will:\nProvide pathways to good prospects for all, with a new growth and skills levy that doubles down on apprenticeship, a proper national skills plan led by a new body Skills England, and getting more people than ever access to quality post-19 training.\nGet children studying creative arts subject or sports until they’re 16.\nDeliver a broader education, introducing a new curriculum which raises the importance of oracy and digital skills.\nEnsure the highest standards in schools, with a reformed Ofsted and recruitment plan to hire more teachers in shortage subjects.\nIntroduce safe-guarding reviews every year.\nBBC Midlands Today\nThis week, I spoke to BBC Midlands Today about the ongoing pressures and challenges facing University Hospitals Birmingham Trust.\nIt’s absolutely right that whistleblowers are asking to see evidence of real change at the Trust. There’s been a lot of reviews, but now we need to see action. I will always hold the trust to account.\nDownload my letter to Jonathan Brotherton below:\nLocal News\nCrime\nThis week, shock figures have revealed that gun crime is on the rise in the West Midlands.\nOfficial statistics show that firearms offences in the West Midlands have rocketed by 86%, with West Midlands Police recording 1,089 gun crimes in the 12 months to March, up from 584 the previous year.\nIt’s really concerning to see such a significant rise in the number of firearms being discharged across the West Midlands. Even more concerning is that this rise is particularly pronounced in our region.\nIt’s clear that West Midlands Police urgently needs support to tackle firearm and violent offences. Under the Tories, the force has had its resources slashed: the Conservatives have cut 2,200 police officers across the West Midlands.\nIn government, Labour will restore neighbourhood policing. We will put 13,000 more police and PCSOs on our streets to keep residents safe and restore faith in the justice system. We’ll also put police hubs at the heart of our towns to give residents a place to share their concerns and secure their communities.\nRight now, it’s paramount that West Midlands Police make clear how it plans to combat this rise in gun crime. Everyone has a right to feel safe and secure in their homes and communities. Residents of the West Midlands deserve to feel safe with the knowledge that the police are working hard to tackle firearm and violent offenses.\nI spoke to The Sunday Mirror:\nBroadband\nThis week, it’s been revealed that one million households are set to be forced to transfer to broadband to keep their line, with fears that the elderly could be cut off.\nAround 95% of over-65s have a landline in their home and may not necessarily have a broadband connection. Many of these landlines use old copper cables, which are now set to be replaced by digital voice technology that connects via a router and uses the internet to make calls. As a result, the elderly risk being left with no reliable way to contact friends and family when in need.\nIn the constituency, we had a case where OpenReach removed a vulnerable, elderly resident’s telephone line despite telling the engineer on the day that he wanted to keep his landline untouched. Upon submitting a complaint, Sky told him that a landline would not be reinstalled and nor would other operators such as BT offer to put one in either.\nProviders must ensure the elderly are fully aware of what they're agreeing to and paying for. I wrote to Sky asking them to review their approach and safeguarding policies around the selling of these packages.\nDownload my letter to Sky:\nPrivate Parking Companies\nThis week, the Government finally responded to a letter that I sent in May expressing my constituents concerns over poorly regulated private parking companies.\nMultiple constituents have told me horror stories after falling victim to poorly regulated private parking firms. Cases I have dealt with include parking firms not providing the correct reduced rate penalty if paid within the first 14 days; Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) being issued to motorists when payment machines were not working properly or not working at all; and a £100 fine levied against a £0.60 ticket which had been paid and displayed but the site staff failed to properly check the vehicle dashboard.\nOf course, there was hope for motorists with the Private Code of Practice, but this was “temporarily withdrawn” in June 2022. I asked the Government when they plan on reinstating the Code. They had no answer. I will always stand up for motorists victimized by private parking companies.\nDownload my letter to the Government:\nCatering Club\nThe registration window for the next Catering Club cohort is now open! The programme starting in October provides working-aged adults with the opportunity to gain qualifications and experience within the catering and hospitality sector. The Catering Club partners with South and City College and Digbeth Dining Club CIC, who deliver qualifications, guidance, and work placement opportunities.\nThe course takes place at Villa Park, every Wednesday and Thursday for 8 weeks. Register by emailing am35@avfc.co.uk, or by calling 0748 490 2066.\nMHRC\nNext week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Farquhar Road East, Edgbaston, B15 3RD, on Tuesday 5th September, and Roundlea Road, Bartley Green, B31 1DB, on Thursday 7th September. The centre will be open between 7am and 12:30pm, so please come along if you're local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Eight in ten NHS dentists aren’t accepting any new adult NHS patients and in some areas it’s 99%. Everyone should be able to access NHS care when they need it. It’s particularly important for pregnant women and new mothers, due to the risk of poor oral health in pregnancy.\n“Labour has a plan to rescue and rebuild NHS dentistry, funded by cracking down on tax dodgers. We will deliver 700,000 additional urgent appointments a year, recruit dentists to areas most in need, and get straight to work on reforming the outdated NHS dental contract.",

The response which arrived more than two months later, failed to address how the Government will tackle the root causes of the issues with West Midlands Ambulance Service. With the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the Women’s Hospital both in Edgbaston constituency, Ms Gill wrote back to the health secretary to query this lack of action.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said, “The Government has spent the last 12 years chronically underfunding NHS services and it is now clear, the longer the Conservatives are in power, the longer patients will have to wait for help. We are now at a point where patients in the West Midlands are being put in serious jeopardy and it is costing lives.\n“Sadly, it comes as no surprise that in response to my letter, the health secretary couldn’t provide any real action being taken to tackle the root cause of the problem with our ambulance service. It is clear they are out of ideas, and this is a situation that is out of control.\nMs Gill responded back to the health secretary in a letter where she listed the actions which must now be taken to solve the crisis. They included:\nAn end to the chronic underfunding of the NHS,\nA realistic plan to tackle the 110,000 staff shortages,\nThere are 333 cases of bed blocking happening at University Hospitals Birmingham alone. These must be freed up which means finding proper solutions to fixing the social care system that allow patients to be safely discharged back into the community,\nProviding adequate support for primary care services so that the public does not resort to dialling 999 to access basic treatment that could otherwise be treated by a GP or dentist.\nThis week Labour brought forward a debate in parliament on primary care. During the debate, MPs raised the point that before the last General Election, the Conservatives promised to hire 6,000 more GPs. Since the Conservatives made that promise, more than 300 GP practices have closed, and 2,000 dentists quit the NHS last year.\nRead Preet's response to the health secretary in full here: https://www.preetkaurgill.co.uk/post/preet-responds-to-health-secretary-on-delays-to-ambulance-service",

These are all changes that the Tories could have put in place but failed to, and will be underpinned by new, published satisfaction figures, putting forces families front and centre.\nLabour will use the Defence Housing Strategy – overseen by Defence Secretary John Healey and Minister for Veterans and People Al Carns – to overhaul the standard of military accommodation across the country, after 14 years of Tory underinvestment left forces accommodation in a shameful state. Under the Tories, satisfaction with the standard of Service Family Accommodation (SFA) fell to record lows in 2023, while the Defence Select Committee reported that two thirds of SFA was ‘essentially no longer fit for purpose’.\nThe Committee found that quality of housing was having a significant impact on Armed Forces recruitment, retention and morale.\nToday’s announcement follows the Labour Government’s landmark deal, completed in January, to bring back 36,000 military homes into public ownership, reversing a 1996 sale described by the Public Accounts Committee as “disastrous”, and saving the taxpayer £600,000 per day by eliminating rental payments to a private company. This included 1587 military family homes in the West Midlands.\nIn February, the Prime Minister announced a historic defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and the Labour government has already delivered the largest pay rise for Armed Forces personnel in over 20 years.\nLabour’s new Consumer Charter will include the following commitments:\n1. A strengthened move-in standard so families can have confidence that the home they are moving into will be ready on time and will be clean and functional.\n2. Improved, clearer information for families ahead of a move, including photographs and floor plans of all homes when a family applies for housing.\n3. More reliable repairs, including an undertaking to complete urgent repairs within a set timeline consistent with Awaab’s Law, and a new online portal for service personnel to manage repairs.\n4. Raising the minimum standard of forces family housing with a new programme of works targeted at the worst homes, with up to 1,000 refurbished as a downpayment on the broader programme of renewal to be set out in the Defence Housing Strategy\n5. Better and clearer communication for families, including a named housing officer for every service family who they can contact for specific housing related queries.\n6. A new, simpler complaints process that will shorten the process to two stages in line with industry best practice, so that service personnel and families have a quicker resolution, backed up by the new Armed Forces Commissioner.\n7. Modernising policies to allow more freedom for families to make improvements, giving them a greater sense of pride in their homes.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston said:\n“Our Armed Forces serve with extraordinary dedication and courage to keep us safe. It is only right that they and their families live in the homes they deserve.\n“Between 2018 and 2023, military families lodged almost 53,000 complaints about their housing. This ends with Labour.\n“Our Labour government is providing 5 military families in my constituency, and 2528 families in the West Midlands, with homes fit for heroes.”\nDefence Secretary, John Healey MP, said:\n\"For too long, military families have endured substandard housing without the basic consumer rights that any of us should expect in our homes. That must end and our new Consumer Charter will begin to stop the rot and put families at the heart of that transformation.\n\"We cannot turn around years of failure on forces housing overnight, but by bringing 36,000 military homes back into public ownership, we've already taken greater control and are working at pace to drive up standards. This is about providing homes fit for the heroes who serve our nation, and I'm determined to deliver the decent, affordable housing that our forces families have every right to expect.\"\nThese improvements will be in place by the one-year anniversary of the announcement to buy back military homes last December, with final detail to be set out in the Defence Housing Strategy following consultation with military personnel and their families.\nMany of the commitments in the Charter will be achieved by driving better performance – and better value for the taxpayer – from existing suppliers of maintenance and support for service family housing.\nThe new standards will be underpinned by new published customer satisfaction measures and enhanced accountability so families can have confidence in the improvements being made. This will sit alongside an independently conducted stock survey, as recommended by the Kerslake review of military housing which was published last year.\nThe Defence Housing Strategy will be driven by an independent review team, and which will be chaired by former Member of Parliament and housing expert Natalie Elphicke Ross OBE, drawing on expertise from industry and forces families.\nThe Strategy will also turbocharge the development of surplus military land, creating opportunities for Armed Forces homeownership and supporting the delivery of affordable homes for families across Britain as part of the government’s Plan for Change.\nIn the meantime, the Defence Secretary and the Minister for Veterans and People have instructed the MOD to immediately plan improvements for the new Consumer Charter, as part of a short-term action plan to enhance the family homes after years of neglect.\nENDS",

The landmark Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which passed its Second Reading in Parliament this week, will finally stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks through historic reforms to safeguarding and children’s social care. Our bill will:\nIntroduce a register for children that are not in school\nFund free breakfast clubs, saving £450 per child\nCap the number of branded school uniform items, saving £50 per child\nYou can read more about our safeguarding reforms and plans to break down the barriers to opportunity here.\nOn Wednesday, the Conservatives had a chance to back our plans to protect vulnerable children from abuse. They failed to do so. If they truly cared about the safety and wellbeing of children and young people, they would support our bill because the measures already set out are designed to keep children safe and protected.\nThe Conservatives have suggested they were calling for a public inquiry into grooming gangs. What they were actually doing was trying to kill our bill altogether.\nHere is the text of their amendment:\nI have been shocked by the politics being played by the Conservatives. This isn't about political manoeuvring - it's about the safety of our children.\nTicket touting\nPreet at the Carabao Cup final\nFor too long, fans have faced an uphill battle to find face value tickets to see their favourite artist perform or sports team play live. These unfair practices look to fleece people of their hard-earned income, which isn’t fair on fans, venues and artists.\nLabour is launching a consultation to put fans back at the heart of live events. The consultation will explore a range of options to make ticket resales fairer and more transparent, which include:\nIntroducing a cap on the price of ticket resales\nIncreasing the accountability of ticket resale website and apps\nStrengthening consumer enforcement\nFind out more about the consultation here.\nViolence Against Women and Girls\nIn a general debate this week about Violence against Women and Girls, our Labour government reaffirmed our unprecedented ambition to halve violence against women and girls within a decade.\nAs an ex-children’s services manger, I have more than 30 years' experience supporting women facing domestic abuse and sexual violence. I welcome Labour’s many commitments to tackling violence against women and girls, including:\nFast-tracking rape cases through the courts and introducing specialist rape courts to deliver swift and effective justice\nPolice given powers to issue Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs)\nEmpowering police to give women the right to know the identity of their online stalkers, strengthening stalking protection orders and ensuring that the police work with all support services to give victims the protection they deserve\nFind out more here.\nLibraries\nPreet outside Bartley Green Library\nLibraries are vital community spaces. They're a base for reading, learning, and wider community activities.\nFor months, I’ve been campaigning to save the libraries in my constituency – Harborne, Quinton and Bartley Green. I'd strongly encourage all groups concerned about maintaining our libraries in the constituency to register their interest with the council.\nYou can read my latest letter here.\nBuses Consultation\nWith Keir Starmer in the constituency\nHave your say about greater public control of our bus network by taking part in the ongoing consultation. You can share your views, and find out more about bus franchising, here.\nPolice meeting\nAt a morning briefing with police\nThe next police meeting for Edgbaston and Harborne residents will be held on 23rd January at 6pm at University of Birmingham Old Gym, Ring Road South, B15 2TT Room LG10. Please do come along if you have any issues that you would like to raise with the police.\nMHWC\nOn Friday 17th January, the MHWC will be visiting Ferncliffe Road in Harborne, B17 0QG. The centre will be open between 7:30am and 1pm, so please do come along if you have any bulky household waste to dispose of.\nJohn Alden\nI was very sad to hear of the passing of John Alden. John was a respected figure in our community and his contributions will be remembered by many.\nI’m sure many of you will join me in extending your condolences to Cllr Deirdre Alden and her family.\nBest wishes,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.Preet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

She has campaigned for equality and access to education for girls)\nBoitos House (named after a Romanian born and Birmingham-based dentist)\nPhelps House (after James and Oliver Phelps, the twin brothers from Birmingham who acted in the Harry Potter films as Fred and George Weasley)\nPreet Gill MP said, “It was wonderful to visit Blakesley Hall today. I know from personal experience how important representation truly is and so to be that role model for the students here and have the honour of having a house named after me was very humbling. I hope that in having houses named after local people who have made positive change will provide real inspiration for the students to go on to achieve anything they set their minds to.”\nDuring the visit, Ms Gill had a tour of the school, met some of the students from Gill House who asked questions about her work as an MP and designed a mascot with the students from her house.\nKirsty Knight, Head of Gill House and Year 6 Teacher at Blakesley Hall said, “I’m so proud to see our school relaunch the House system. Blakesley Hall is a culturally diverse school, representing over 30 different nations and approximately 30 languages. To be able to name the houses after such inspirational leaders from our region that reflect the community at Blakesley Hall is fantastic and I hope it offers real motivation to our students to succeed in their future lives.”",

That’s really important because quality of teaching can make the single biggest difference to children’s life chances and I want young people in Birmingham, Edgbaston to leave school ready for work and ready for life.\nThe Bill will cut the cost of sending children to school to make life easier for families, with free breakfast clubs in every primary school and a cap on the number of branded school uniform items.\nBreakfast clubs boost children’s attendance, attainment, behaviour and readiness to learn. But taken together, these measures could also save parents in Birmingham, Edgbaston £500 per child, per year, easing the strain of the cost of living.\nCrucially, the Bill will stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks through landmark reforms to safeguarding and children’s social care.\nAs an ex-children's services manager, I have seen so many tragic cases of children being failed by the system in recent years. We can’t have any more empty words or ‘lessons learned’. We need real action to keep children safe.\nWe’re taking these steps so we can deliver on Labour’s mission to break down the barriers to opportunity – to sever the link between background and success.\nThat means where you come from doesn’t determine where you end up and that if you work hard, you should be able to get on in life.\nThat’s a principle that I know so many people in [constituency] hold close and through our Plan for Change, this Labour government will make it a reality.\nI’m backing Labour’s Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill every step of the way because children growing up in Birmingham, Edgbaston deserve the best start in life, nothing less.",

The new measures will prevent disengaged landlords from sitting on empty units which could otherwise be supporting local economic growth and jobs.\nThe announcement comes as Labour takes action to breathe new life into our high streets after 14 years of Conservative economic mismanagement. Research shows that, by the time the Tories left office, around 16.2% of retail units sat empty across the West Midlands.\nSince being elected, Labour has made revitalising high streets and town centres a core part of its Plan for Change. The party has already introduced new measures to tackle late payments, cut taxes for small businesses by increasing the employment allowance, and drive down antisocial behaviour blighting high streets. A new Small Business Strategy will be introduced later this year.\nCommenting Preet Kaur Gill MP said:\n“Labour’s Plan for Change will put more money into the pockets of working people and breathe new life into our communities after 14 years of Conservative chaos.”\n“High streets are the beating heart of our local communities and are key to driving economic growth and supporting good jobs across Birmingham.”\n“No one wants to see shuttered shops in our town centres, so I’m really pleased that eight new councils will lead the way with new powers to tackle empty shop units.”\nENDS",

In West Midlands, the figure stands at 807, with over 200 of those being found in Birmingham alone.\nWarm banks are public venues that anyone can visit in order to keep warm and have been opened by local councils, community organisations and faith groups. The surge in warm banks comes amidst a fuel poverty crisis.\nLabour has announced plans to reduce energy costs and insulate homes, saving households up to £1,400 off their annual bills, not just for one year, but for years to come. This would be paid for by bringing in a proper one-off windfall tax on energy giants and spending that on a package of support for energy bills.\nCommenting, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said: “I would like to thank those across the West Midlands who are stepping up to support the most vulnerable, especially to all the community groups across my constituency of Birmingham Edgbaston. This is vital work that is happening in the absence of any government support, but it shouldn’t have to be like this.\n“Too often this burden is falling to local councils and the third sector without the strategy and resources in place to make the difference to people who are becoming desperate. With energy bills set to soar in April it’s a disgrace that Rishi Sunak’s Government is entirely missing in action and is yet to lift a finger.\n“Labour would bring in a proper windfall tax to stop the energy price cap going up in April, insulate millions of homes, and save families hundreds on their energy bills for years to come.”\nENDS\nNotes to Editors:\nLabour analysis of 405 district, borough and county councils reveal there are at least 12,834 warm banks in the UK; this figure comes from:\n372 FOI responses from local authorities\nLocal authority websites\nhttps://www.warmwelcome.uk/, a national register of warm banks\nOver 3 million low-income households cannot afford to heat their homes: https://www.jrf.org.uk/press/over-three-million-low-income-households-said-they-have-not-been-able-keep-their-home-warm\n8.6 million households are estimated to be in fuel poverty as of April 2023 meaning they live in energy-inefficient homes and have a residual income below the official poverty line after paying to heat their homes: https://www.endfuelpoverty.org.uk/about-fuel-poverty/\nRachel Reeves recent speech setting out Labour’s cost of living support plans can be found here: https://labour.org.uk/press/rachel-reeves-speech-at-fabian-society-new-year-conference/",

However, it has been entirely overshadowed by skyrocketing fuel costs that have increased prices by as much as 47p/litre in the last year, according to the RAC.\nThe figures come as oil and gas producers, including Shell and BP, took in billions in profits, with BP hailing “more money than we know what to do with”.\nLabour today reiterated its call on the government to bring forward an emergency budget to tackle the Tory cost of living crisis. This would prioritise five measures including with a one-off windfall tax on the soaring profits of oil and gas producers to help households through the crisis with up to £600 in support. Labour would also ramp up home insulation, scrap the unfair National Insurance hike, and provide support for struggling businesses.\nCommenting Preet Kaur Gill said: “This is a savage extra cost for working people, particularly given the tax hike to national insurance that people across our city will be facing this week as they open their pay packets. It is outrageous that the Chancellor has raised taxes 15 times – costing families over £1000 this year.\n“The Conservative Government needs to set out an emergency budget to tackle their cost-of-living crisis and support Labour’s call that would put money back in the pockets of working people.\n“Labour’s plan would help households through this crisis with up to £600 cut off energy bills and turbocharge our transition to clean transport so never again are the British people left so exposed to unstable foreign oil.”\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\nLabour has called on the government to bring forwarded an emergency budget – and prioritise five measures that could be enacted now, to make a material difference to the millions of pensioners and working people feeling the crunch from the crisis:\nPut a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut home energy bills: Bring in a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits, to cut household bills by up to £600, including through a VAT cut on home energy bills and an increase and expansion of the Warm Homes Discount.\nProvide support for struggling businesses: Labour would cut taxes for businesses by giving SMEs a discount on their business rates bill worth up to £5,700 this year, funded by a tax on the online giants. We’d also bring in a £600 million contingency fund, raised by the windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits, for those industries and businesses struggling the most with rising bills like steel and other energy-intensive firms.\nSpike the hike: Scrap the National Insurance hike which this government has introduced in the midst of a cost of living crisis.\nInsulate homes: Commit to a rapid ramp up of home upgrades with a clear target to meet by the end of the year, to make them more energy efficient and cheaper to heat, saving households £400 on average every year.\nStop the waste: Allow the National Crime Agency to investigate the £11.8 billion of taxpayer funds lost to fraud and error, so no more taxpayer money is flushed down the drain.\nDiesel car:\nThe cost of a litre of diesel has risen by £0.47p over the past year according to Government and RAC data (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/weekly-road-fuel-prices; https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/fuel-watch/)\nThere are 1.2 cars per household in the UK, and 12,499,187 diesel cars in the United Kingdom and the average car travels 6,800 miles: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/veh02-licensed-cars; https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/number-cars-great-britain#:~:text=How%20many%20cars%20are%20there%20per%20household%20UK%3F,per%20household%20in%20the%20UK; https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts09-vehicle-mileage-and-occupancy\nBased on the MPG of an average family car of 43 for diesel, this means on average a car user uses 719 litres of fuel in a year: https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg#:~:text=The%20average%20UK%20car%20drives,the%20equivalent%20of%20132%20MPGe\nWith the price of diesel increasing by £0.47p per litre 19 April 2021 to 21 April 2022, the rise in fuel prices over the last year leaves a driver using their facing £337 in extra petrol costs over a year (£928 in March 2021; £1265 in April 2022 = £337).\nThat is an extra £4.2bn for households on diesel.\nDiesel was 170.09 on 10 March 2022.\nPetrol car:\nThe cost of a litre of unleaded petrol has risen by £0.37p over the past year according to Government and RAC data (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/weekly-road-fuel-prices)\n1.25 on 19 April 2021 to 1.62 on 21 April 2022 https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/fuel-watch/\nThere are 1.2 cars per household in the UK, and 19,097,402 petrol cars and the average car travels 6,800 miles in a year: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/veh02-licensed-cars; https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/number-cars-great-britain#:~:text=How%20many%20cars%20are%20there%20per%20household%20UK%3F,per%20household%20in%20the%20UK; https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts09-vehicle-mileage-and-occupancy\nBased on the MPG of an average petrol family car of 36, this means on average a household uses 859.2 litres of fuel in a year https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg#:~:text=The%20average%20UK%20car%20drives,the%20equivalent%20of%20132%20MPGe\nWith the price of petrol increasing by £0.37p per litre April 2021 to April 2022, the rise in fuel prices over the last year leaves a driver using their facing £318 in extra petrol costs over a year.

However, it is horrifying to think that these incredible assets are being turned into sewers.\n“While we have heard much about sewage being dumped into our seas, as a land locked city, many don’t think this issue affects us here in Birmingham. However, this new data shows that, that is simply not the case.\n“This is an issue the Conservatives have actively encouraged. Conservative MPs not only voted to allow water firms to continue sewage dumping, but blocked a Labour-backed amendment that would have progressively eliminated sewage dumping. I am horrified that Birmingham-based MPs Andrew Mitchell and Gary Sambrook could have voted for such measures.”\nThe news will inevitably once again spark serious concern at the environmental, health and economic impact that sewage dumping is having on communities across the country.\nJim McMahon OBE MP, Shadow Environment Secretary said:\n“That the Tories have allowed villages, towns, and cities across the country to be treated as open sewers shows that they have no respect for places where people live, work and holiday.\n“Communities in Edgbaston Constituency should be able to just enjoy the place where they live without having to worrying about encountering filthy raw sewage.\n“The next Labour Government will end the Tory sewage scandal, delivering mandatory monitoring on all sewage outlets, introducing automatic fines for discharges, setting ambitious targets for stopping systematic sewage dumping and ensuring that water bosses are held to account for negligence.”",

Across the whole of Birmingham, nearly 2,000 spills were counted, dumping over six months’ worth of sewage into the city’s natural environment.\nThe Rivers Trust Interactive Map which displays constituency breakdowns of monitored storm overflows, shows that in 2021, raw sewage was discharged into Birmingham’s natural environment for a total duration of 4,627 hours. This equates to there having been a continuous flow of sewage taking place for over six months of the year, Labour Party analysis has found. 225 hours’ worth of raw sewage was dumped into the River Rea at the Pershore Road storm overflow in Edgbaston alone.\nThe map also points to 1,981 spills across Birmingham in 2021. This means that on average, there was a sewage spill event every 5 hours, a damning indictment of Tory failure to hold water bosses to account in polluting the areas in which people live and work.\nA fortnight ago, the Labour Party found that that on average water companies in England and Wales are pumping raw sewage into our natural environment every two-and-a-half minutes, with areas such as beaches, playing fields and bathing waters having faced 1,076 years-worth of raw sewage over a six-year period.\nThis comes amid revelations last week, that prime ministerial hopeful Liz Truss was responsible for unleashing cuts of tens of millions of pounds to the Environment Agency, with Environment Agency data showing that the Tories presided over a doubling of water companies dumping raw sewage in subsequent years.\nSpecifically, during her time as Environment Secretary and as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Truss failed to hold a single meeting with a water company to discuss their performance of sewage dumping and oversaw the slashing of Environment Agency grant, by a quarter, which was dedicated to monitoring of water companies and cutting pollution in our waters.\nEnvironment Agency sources pointed to staff having been moved away from environmental monitoring following Truss’ period at DEFRA, casting serious doubts over Truss’ competency on major issues facing her previous departments and judgement in understanding the consequences of her decisions.\nLast year, Conservative MPs voted to allow water firms to continue sewage dumping, having blocked a Labour-backed amendment to the Environment Bill, that would have sought to progressively eliminate sewage dumping into our natural environment.\nGary Sambrook, the Conservative MP for Birmingham, Northfield, voted to allow water companies to carry on dumping sewage. 167 hours’ worth of untreated effluent was piped into waterways in his constituency last year.\nJim McMahon, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said:\n“Conservative MPs who are busy Tippexing over their voting records must explain to the country why they voted to allow the scenes of sewage dumping that we’re seeing on the news.\n“Families across the country should be able to just enjoy where they live, work or holiday, without having to worrying about encountering filthy sewage as a result of water firms being allowed to cut corners.\n“Britain deserves better than a zombie Tory government up to its neck in raw sewage. A Labour government will use the levers of power to hold reckless water bosses to account and toughen regulations to prevent them from gaming the system.”\nPreet Kaur Gill, Labour MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“People in Edgbaston are rightly disgusted by scenes of raw sewage being piped into our rivers and waterways. This Conservative government’s incompetence is defiling our city’s beautiful brooks and rivers, and killing our natural environment.\n“I am proud to have voted to eliminate this stomach-turning practice, but I am staggered that my neighbouring Conservative MP voted to let water firms carry on. With over six months’ worth of raw sewage dumped in Birmingham’s rivers and brooks last year, the Tories have some serious explaining to do.”\nNotes to editors:\n1.

Yet, these local employers are crucial to the local community and high street.\nLabour has recognised the support that small businesses need not only to survive but to thrive. This is why the party has pledged to cut and eventually entirely scrap business rates, replacing them with a new form of business taxation fit for the 21st Century. This would help level the playing field between online giants and bricks and mortar businesses.\nLabour’s plan will also tackle the £20bn late payments crisis affecting SMEs. The Federation of Small Businesses has recently said that proposed Labour plans to help small businesses get their unpaid invoices paid on time are “exactly what the UK’s 5.5m SMEs need”.\nWith more than £20bn in unpaid invoices outstanding at any one time, the delay is costing small businesses £684m.\nPreet Kaur Gill, Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said:\n“I am delighted to support this tenth anniversary year of Small Business Saturday. Small businesses do so much to enrich our lives and our community, providing jobs, training and driving economic growth.\n“I know that businesses like Coffee and Café @ 268 in Quinton have faced massive adversity and hardship over the last few years and beyond, and now face further challenges like unfair business rates, supply chain issues and soaring energy costs.\n“We will carry out the biggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation, supporting our small businesses which are a critical part of our economy and communities, while balancing the playing field between bricks and mortar businesses and online giants.\n“Local businesses want a reliable partner in government that will listen to their concerns and take real, practical steps to help them thrive. Labour has a plan that will make a real difference for business owners looking to get on, both immediately and in the long-term.”\nJamie Whitehouse from Coffee and Café @ 268 on Ridgacre Road in Quinton said:\n“It was really difficult trying to set up a new business with rising energy bills and with food costs getting more expensive. I only want to serve the best quality food to my customers so that they have an enjoyable experience, in a cosy coffee shop and return time and again. But, setting up a new family business in these conditions scared me. I worry about being able to pay my staff at the end of the month.\n“But I love cooking and meeting new people. And while I never thought I would go from builder to café owner, this is my passion, so I’m determined to work with my partner, Wayne Stopps, to make this a success and a fantastic place for everyone in the community to come and enjoy.”",

It won’t tackle criminal gangs or deter small boats – instead, it will make it harder to get international return agreements, harder to prosecute trafficking and smuggler gangs, and it will lock up children, pregnant women and torture victims.\nThere is nothing in the Bill to tackle the smuggling gangs that threaten our border security and put lives at risk. That’s why Labour put forward an amendment to strengthen the capacity of the NCA to tackle organised immigration crime, and to establish a specific Cross-Border People Smuggling Unit to disrupt the gangs and prevent more dangerous crossings.\nLabour believes in strong border security and a properly managed and controlled asylum system so the UK does our bit alongside other countries to help those fleeing persecution and conflict.\nLabour has a five-point plan to reform the asylum system. We will:\n1. Crack down on criminal smuggler gangs, through a new Cross-Border Police Unit\n2. Clear the backlog and end hotel use\n3. Reform resettlement routes to stop people being exploited by gangs\n4. Sign a new agreement with France and other countries on returns and family reunion\n5. Tackle humanitarian crises at source and help refugees in their region\nCentenary Action\nThis week, I shared my thoughts on being a woman MP with Centenary Action.\nI'm so proud to be the first female Sikh MP, the fourth woman to represent Edgbaston, and the 480th woman MP ever elected.\nThe most important thing that women MPs bring to politics is our whole selves; our lived experience, our diverse voices and our diverse journeys. It’s also, of course, that we represent half of the population.\nRead the rest of my piece here:\nUHB Meeting\nThis week, I chaired a Cross Party Reference Group meeting about the latest patient safety review of University Hospitals Birmingham.\nThe meeting was arranged after a follow-up to the initial Bewick review was published. It was positive to hear that progress has been made, although it’s also clear that there’s a lot of work still to do. The culture review is still ongoing, and the next test will be to see if its recommendations are successfully implemented and embedded.\nThere were three findings in the latest Bewick report that have been particularly worrying:\nConcerns over GMC referrals and the overall processes around this in place at the Trust;\nConcerns over the integrity of data entry in cardiac surgery;\nConcerns over allegations of misogynistic behaviour and sexual harassment.\nI will make sure that these issues are addressed.\nAs chair of the Cross Party Reference Group, I will continue to support these reviews into patient safety. We will carry on raising concerns, asking questions, bringing together local voices, and collaborating with the Trust to ensure a successful transition to a reformed UHB.\nMeeting with NEU members\nIt was great to meet with local NEU members this week. The work that teachers do is invaluable, and I am always impressed by the standard of schools in the constituency.\nI know that teachers are striking right now. It doesn’t have to be this way.\nLabour will strengthen the teaching profession and re-establish it as a career that is respected and valued.\nWe will also:\nEnd the recruitment and retention crisis that is doing so much damage to standards in schools\nRecruit over 6,500 more teachers to ensure every child has an excellent specialist teacher in their classroom\nTeach a broader curriculum to set children up for work and for life.\nLocal News\nThere is an ongoing sham consultation between the Government and rail companies over plans to close down ticket offices in train stations. So, this week, I have been fighting to keep our ticket offices open in Five Ways and University Station.\nThis week, I wrote to the Government and West Midlands Trains on behalf of my constituents. I am deeply worried about the impact that this will have on my elderly and disabled constituents, the staff employed in my constituency, and all those who rely on the support and advice provided by staff in ticket offices.\nIt’s vital that all passengers can use our rail network with assurance and confidence.\nThe Government must scrap its plans to cut staff and close our ticket offices.\nThis week, I met with Transport for West Midlands to discuss investment into improving connectivity along the Hagley Road corridor. I know that currently journey times are too long. I will always push for better transport links between the constituency and the city centre.\nNext Wednesday, 19th July, residents are invited to the next Edgbaston Ward Forum Meeting from 7pm – 9pm at Edgbaston Community Centre, Woodview Drive, B15 2HR. Matters to be discussed include the Ward Action Plan, local funding opportunities that community and voluntary groups can apply for, highways, local updates and residents’ news.\nNext Week, the Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting The Holloway, Bartley Green, B31 1TR, on Tuesday 18th July, and Richmond Hill Road, Edgbaston, B15 3RJ, on Wednesday 19th July.

Labour will put colleges at the heart of our plans to break down barriers to opportunity and boost Britain’s skills.\nIn government, we will develop ‘Technical Excellence’ colleges, enabling local government to work hand-in-hand with local businesses and employers to align skills and training provision with local need.\nWe’ll also reform the Tory’s failed Apprenticeship Levy into a ‘Growth and Skills Levy’ so it can be used on a greater range of training courses, giving businesses the flexibility they need.\nOur national mission to boost Britain’s skills will be overseen by a new body, Skills England, bringing together central and local government, businesses, training providers and unions to meet the skills needs of the next decade across all regions.\nMore training opportunities so people can gain new skills, access better jobs and grow our economy. That’s the difference that a Labour government will make.\nQuinton Police Station\nThis week, I’m thrilled to announce that Quinton Police Station is to be retained as a base for neighbourhood police teams. This is a great result for our community.\nSince the station first closed its doors, I’ve been fighting tirelessly alongside residents, our Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster, and local councillors to have it reopened as a police base or family hub. Thank you all so much for your efforts over the last four years. What an achievement!\nThis is evidence that Labour is delivering locally. We will ensure our streets are safe by bringing back neighbourhood policing and putting more criminals behind bars. Keeping Quinton Police Station open means our officers will have a visible presence in the areas they serve.\nRead more in an article by Birmingham Live:\nITV Central\nThis week, I appeared on ITV Central Lobby with Alison Mackenzie, alongside Heather Wheeler, Tory MP for South Derbyshire, and Michael Mullaney, Lib Dem Leader of the opposition on Leicestershire County Council.\nOn the show we discussed HS2, Labour’s missions for government, and the Tamworth by-election.\nClick the link below to see the full episode:\nNew Statesman\nThis week, I told the New Statesman my policy priorities as Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Public Health.\nAs a priority, I want to engage with and learn from GPs, pharmacists and dentists – the front door of our health service – to build an NHS fit for the future.\nAfter 75 years, the front door to the NHS is suffering because primary care is overwhelmed and inaccessible. But this crisis in primary care is not incurable.\nLabour will reform primary care by shoring up community services while reducing the burden on hospitals. We will improve GP access by training more GPs to take the pressure off those currently working in the system, and explore new and more varied opportunities for patients to access the healthcare they need.\nRead the full article below:\nBDA\nThis week, I met with Eddie Crouch, Chair of BDA Principal Executive Committee, to discuss Labour’s rescue plan for NHS dentistry.\nLabour will take immediate action to provide care for those in most urgent need, and long-term reform to restore NHS dentistry to all who need it. We will:\n- Fund NHS dental practices to provide 700,000 more urgent appointments, for patients in need of things like fillings and root canal.\n- Provide incentives for new dentists to work in areas with the greatest need, to tackle the emergence of ‘dental deserts’ where no NHS dentists are taking on new patients\n- Introduce supervised toothbrushing in schools for 3-5 year olds, targeted at the areas with highest childhood tooth decay\n- Reform the dental contract to rebuild the service in the long-run, so NHS dentistry is there for all who need it.\nBy-elections\nThis week, Labour made history in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire with two ground-breaking by-election victories.\nVoters across the country clearly want change, and Labour is ready to deliver that for them.\nCongratulations to Sarah Edwards and Alistair Strathern. I look forward to seeing you both in Parliament.\nLocal News\nSpeed Limit Consultation\nBirmingham City Council’s consultation around reviewing all existing 40mph speed limits across the city, with the intention that almost all will be revoked, with these becoming 30mph, remains open.

Shockingly, 749 people locally had to wait more than 12 hours to be admitted to accident and emergency and just 50% of patients were admitted to A&E were seen within 4 hours. This is against the NHS targets which say that 95% of patients should be admitted, transferred, or discharged in that time.\nAccident and emergency departments across the country are facing huge pressures. As the Culture Secretary, Nadine Dorries, admitted, a decade of Conservative mismanagement left the health service “wanting and inadequate” when the pandemic struck.\nThere are now also 6.73 million people on the NHS waiting list in England as of June 2022. This is the highest ever recorded. At the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, following a decade of Tory mismanagement there were 4.4 million people on the NHS waiting list in England, then a record high. Nationally, the standard of 92% of people seen within 18 weeks of a referral has not been met since 2016 and again in Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham has seen some of the worst rates in the country, with only 41.6% treated within 18 weeks.\nWith these numbers getting worse and worse, Preet Kaur Gill MP has written to Professor David Rosser, the Chief Executive of the Trust, to ask what the Trust is doing to improve performance. Given growing waiting times don’t just stop at emergency medicine, the Birmingham Edgbaston MP is looking to work with the hospital to see that they receive the necessary support and assistance before it heads into the more challenging autumn and winter months.\nCommenting, Preet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said:\n“Patients in University Hospitals Birmingham in need of medical attention are forced to wait far too long to be seen, left for hours often in serious pain.\n“Unacceptable waits mean people across Birmingham are falling through the cracks. It has recently been reported that the total number of additional A&E-linked deaths since waiting times rocketed nationwide could be as many as 12,000. At the same time as the Conservatives are putting up taxes on working people, they are lowering standards for patients. We’re paying more but waiting longer and it is putting patient lives at risk.\n“I’ve had many constituents reach out to me about their concerns with our NHS. One resident in particular told me how they were diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent treatment at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. They now have suspected ‘secondary’ colorectal cancer for which they should have been referred under a specific ‘cancer pathway’ within a two-week appointment window, instead they were made to wait 11 weeks.\n“Government ministers don’t seem to be taking this crisis seriously and are missing in action. We have queues outside of A&E, rising backlogs and people unable to even get GP appointments. Our NHS is at a breaking point. We need a change in government to give us the fresh start.”\nWes Streeting MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said:\n“Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are living in a fantasy world where the NHS isn’t worth mentioning. The truth is the health service is facing the biggest crisis in its history, with one in every eight people waiting for care. The Conservative leadership candidates have no plans to even begin to fix this.\n“Among those 6.7 million on waiting lists, there could be a huge number of undiagnosed conditions like cancer. Record waiting times have a cost in lives.\n“More patients than ever before are left waiting an entire day to be seen for emergency conditions. 24 hours in A&E was just a TV programme, now it’s the reality under the Conservatives.\n“The next Labour government will get patients treated on time by providing the NHS with the staff, equipment and modern technology it needs.”\nENDS\nNotes to Editors",

Birmingham MP Preet Kaur Gill said today’s announcement on interest rates was ‘devastating’ for families.\nThe Bank of England today announced a hike in interest rates to 5% - the 13th time in a row that rates have increased. The Edgbaston MP said 7,400 families in her constituency would be hit by the ‘Tory mortgage penalty’ as homeowners with expiring fixed-rate mortgages face misery.\nMore than 1 million households across Britain are expected to lose at least 20% of their disposable incomes thanks to the surge in mortgage costs, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Preet Kaur Gill said many of her constituents were on a ‘cliff edge' and called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to step in to ‘stop families from losing their homes.’\nLabour analysis has forecast that 7,400 of families in Birmingham Edgbaston will face an annual mortgage payment increase of £2,600 this year under the Conservatives. This week, economists warned of further job losses and a sharp recession.\n“The Tory mortgage penalty is devastating for family finances and is holding back our economy,” said Preet Kaur Gill, Labour MP for Edgbaston. “The country is buckling under 13 years of Conservative mismanagement and a crashed economy, and it is families being asked to pay more on their mortgage once again.\n“People are asking themselves whether they or their family are better off under the Tories. The answer is no.#\n“Labour will bring financial and economic security back, so that families are not constantly on a cliff edge, and so that we can urgently grow our economy to grab hold of opportunities of the future.”\nWith the Government and Bank of England under rising pressure over their failure to rein in inflation, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insists he feels a \"deep moral responsibility\" to deliver on his pledge to halve inflation by the end of the year. But calls are mounting for the Government to do more to help.",

A further 57,570 people had to wait more than two weeks.\nAlmost two million people in England had to wait more than 28 days in October, while a further 4.3 million had to wait more than two weeks. At the same time, the number of GPs has fallen to a record low, leaving patients in a desperate scramble to be seen. Since 2013, 4,600 GPs have been cut.\nThe findings come as MPs prepare to vote on a motion proposed by the Labour Party to abolish the non-dom tax status, which allows some wealthy people who live in Britain to pay their taxes overseas, to pay for training a new generation of NHS staff. Labour’s plan would:\nDouble the number of medical school places, training 15,000 new doctors a year\nTrain 10,000 additional nurses and midwives every year\nDouble the number of district nurses qualifying each year\nTrain 5,000 new health visitors\nLabour’s plan will see patients guaranteed a face-to-face appointment with a GP if they want one. While some patients prefer to hold appointments over the phone, many are frustrated at not being able to see their doctor in person, and just 22% of patients are given a choice in the type of appointment they have. One in seven people who try to speak to a nurse or GP were unable to get an appointment at all last year.\nLabour is also pledging to bring back the family doctor, so patients can see the same GP each appointment if they choose to. Patients are increasingly unable to see the doctor of their choice, with two in every three patients rarely or never speaking to their preferred doctor, up from just half in 2018. Under Labour’s plans, GP practices will be provided with incentives to offer patients continuity of care, so doctors must take into account patients’ preferences\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said:\n“Patients in Birmingham are finding it impossible to see a GP when they need to and we have to remember that of those 17,000 waiting more than a month or not getting an appointment at all, there will be conditions going undiagnosed until it is too late.\n“The Conservatives have had 12 years to train the staff our NHS needs but instead, has left it with thousands fewer GPs. This is simply unacceptable and it’s patients in Birmingham that are left paying the price, too often in pain and discomfort.\n“Labour will train a new generation of doctors and nurses, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status that allows people who live in Britain to pay their taxes overseas. Patients need doctors’ appointments more than the wealthiest need a tax break. Patients should be able to see the doctor they want, in the manner they choose, when they need to. Labour will put patients first and get them seen on time again.”\nENDS\nNotes to Editors\n1,911,538 people in England had to wait more than 28 days for an appointment in October, while a further 4,328,359 people had to wait more than two weeks.

These sky-high figures even trump the number of 111 calls made during the pandemic (1.1 million in 2020/1), when patients could not see an NHS dentist.\nOver the last five years, just shy of 4.8 million calls were made to 111 about dental problems. Many people who ring 111 call with issues that are classified by the NHS as “urgent”, like severe dental pain.\nThese figures expose the consequences of being unable to access an NHS dental appointment after 14 years of Conservative government.\nThe crisis in NHS dentistry is well-documented, with 8 out of 10 dental practices no longer accepting new NHS patients and 1 in 10 people having been forced to attempt their own dental work. As people are unable to access dental care, their symptoms deteriorate, and they are forced to rely on emergency services once their condition has significantly worsened.\nEarlier this year, the government announced a handful of dentistry measures, yet just 3% of dentists believe the so-called ‘recovery plan’ will solve the NHS patient crisis.\nThe government has also admitted in response to a parliamentary question from Labour that “no estimates are currently available of the number of urgent and emergency dental appointments that will be delivered through the plan.”\nPreet Kaur Gill MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Public Health Secretary, said: “The sky-rocketing number of 111 calls shows the Tories’ destruction on NHS dentistry is putting the rest of the NHS under greater pressure. After 14 years of Tory neglect, patients are desperately queuing around the block to see a dentist, literally pulling their own teeth out, and tooth decay is the number one reason young children are admitted to hospital. It’s time for a change.\n“Labour has a plan to rescue NHS dentistry, and reform it for the long run. We will fund 700,000 extra urgent appointments a year; deliver a targeted recruitment scheme for dentists in left-behind areas; and we will get straight to work on reforming the outdated NHS dental contract.”",

They have had to put up with people gaining unauthorised access; desecrating communal areas; breaking the main entrance doors; and urinating/defecating in the stairwell and lift.

The letter also asked that the Council see if it makes financial sense to upgrade the main entrance doors so that they cannot be so easily broken in the future.\nConversations remain ongoing and Preet is committed to supporting residents to stamp out antisocial behaviour so that all those living in Century Tower can live safely and securely in their homes.\nSee Preet's letter in full below.\nIf you have questions or concerns about antisocial behaviour in your area then please write to Preet on preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk or telephone 0121 392 8426.",

Earlier last week, the Foreign Office ruled out intervening in the case.\nJagtar also known as Jaggi, was detained in Punjab when he was there for his wedding in 2017. The Sikh blogger was locked up and accused of being involved in a political murder plot.\nWhile an investigation by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found there was no legal basis for Jagtar's imprisonment, the 36-year-old has remained in prison for six years and faces the death penalty.\nBirmingham MP Preet Kaur Gill, who has been campaigning for Jagtar Singh Johal’s release for years, spoke to BirminghamLive and said more needs to be done by Rishi Sunak to ensure Jaggi is released as soon as possible.\nShe said: \"Six years down the line, it’s really concerning to see the Government backtracking on its commitment to call for Jaggi’s release. It’s unclear exactly what Rishi said when he raised the case of Jagtar Singh Johal to Modi this weekend, but given the significant pushback we have seen from him over the last year, it’s unlikely to be promising.\n\"Particularly concerning was Sunak’s response to a letter from Keir Starmer in February, in which the PM refused to confirm “if the UK government still believes that Jagtar is being arbitrarily detained and if so, what further steps the Government will take to secure a breakthrough in the case.”\nShe also explained how it is Foreign Office policy to call for a British National’s release if they have been arbitrarily detained. The MP added: \"There should be no confusion over Jaggi’s position and no question over calling for his release. It will concern many in the UK that while Boris Johnson understood Jaggi to be arbitrarily detained, Rishi Sunak seems to hold a different opinion.\n\"More should be done to call for Jaggi’s release. Every government has a duty to stand up for its citizens arbitrarily detained abroad. The fact that Rishi is cowering away from the issue is simply more evidence of his crippling weakness. Jaggi’s detention is clearly arbitrary and the Government’s refusal to help will worry many British Nationals who could fall victim to a similar situation overseas.\n\"Unsurprisingly, I’ve had many people from the Sikh community contact me, who feel disheartened and worried by the Government’s inability to stand up for British Sikhs.

Research by Inter Scientific also found many vapes seized from shop shelves contained heavy metals and dangerous substances, including lead and anti-freeze, increasing the risk of harm to users. Over a third of products marketed as “nicotine-free” were also found to contain nicotine.\nEarlier this year, in Birmingham, trading standards and the police led raids on retailers, where they seized nearly £6 million pounds worth of illicit vapes, tobacco and drugs. One raid alone, the biggest ever in Birmingham, clawed £1 million pounds of goods out of the hands of criminals.\nShocking research by Labour found that last year 50 per cent of UK councils reported instances of cigarettes or tobacco products being sold to minors. To protect children and crack down on these illegal sales, the Government has confirmed it is also taking forward new £200 on-the-spot fines in England and Wales for breaches of age of sale restrictions.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“On the Conservatives’ watch, children were getting hooked on nicotine and sold vapes that contained dangerous chemicals like lead and anti-freeze. Vapes marketed as 0% nicotine were found to actually contain nicotine, and addicting a generation of children to this harmful substance.\n“Our strengthened Tobacco and Vapes Bill will tackle the illicit trade of tobacco products and free our children from a life imprisoned by addiction.”\nOther measures introduced by the Labour Government to strengthen the Tobacco and Vapes Bill include closing loopholes on vape vending machines and banning vape advertising, promotions and sponsorships.\nThis week, the Government has also announced a £10 million boost for Trading Standards will bolster operations in local communities for the next year, funding an expected 80 more apprentice enforcement officers to stop harmful tobacco and vape products finding their way into neighbourhood shops and stopping underage sales.\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\n50% of UK Councils reported incidents of cigarettes or tobacco products being sold to minors: https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2023-11-28/4229/\nDespite being branded as having “0% nicotine”, research by Inter Scientific has revealed that 35% of e-cigarettes claiming to be nicotine-free actually contained nicotine: https://www.vapouround.com/news/press-releases/jordan-north-investigates-the-uks-vaping-phenomenon-in-new-documentary-for-bbc-three/\nResearch conducted by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute estimates that a third of all vapes sold may be non-compliant: https://security-uk.m.mimecastprotect.com/ttpwp/?tkn=3.RIM--cEVLFy4Zd0zr7-buPm-t_a31Gb7OKSsOjY9fY7xRLlHPgj9CMCiHB7WkeoVn0a7d9zPKQ5MPVk7DEySbdTuH6RaJYGCRCh1VwRbzoD8Tk92Ub9nUxi7QvqkVF9EFFx3lPpTv2s-V2PAxjcmQBUqYH7Ia-b2zbx4d7kJyeM.12X5YGHOv82Tqiir0Rv7VQ#/checking?key=aFiBfl5iRGY8fS-wBXX-8K4vg-x7jBR1nfguJKwahsoOBtkHZfWDWsvFYWxD7QrO995GxRTn43UVo1wT6wS8xn9vbkbraCCUw89L0_laqu4ihZXdNmLGH7OQNXsCo8oM\nIn Birmingham, trading standards and the police led raids on retailers, where they seized nearly £6 million pounds worth of illicit vapes, tobacco and drugs: https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/biggest-raid-birmingham-among-councils-30832191",

Earlier this week, 12-year-old Leo Ross was murdered in Hall Green, Birmingham, after a knife attack on his way home from school.\nUnder the Conservatives, knife crime rose drastically. In July, the ONS found knife crime in England and Wales had shot up by 78% over the past ten years.\nEnforcement for knife offences has also been remarkably low. Only 4 in 10 knife possession offences last year resulted in any formal criminal justice outcome, meaning that far too often, carrying a knife has not carried any consequences.\nThis week, in a Parliamentary debate on knife crime in the West Midlands, Preet Kaur Gill MP expressed her concern about the rise of serious violence among young people and welcomed the Government’s commitment to halve knife crime in a decade.\nLabour is working to tackle violent crime in our communities by delivering a vital funding boost of up to £1 billion in 2025-2026 for police forces across England and Wales. This includes £100 million to kickstart the recruitment of 13,000 neighbourhood officers and £50 million for Violence Reduction Units to tackle knife crime.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“Knife crime is a crisis in our communities. In recent years, I have been witness to some horrific cases – in every one, what strikes you immediately is the senselessness of it.\n“We must work to prevent this awful crime and find a meaningful solution to the epidemic of young boys taking each other’s lives.\n“I welcome the Government’s much-needed funding boost to our police force, including a dedicated pot for tackling knife crime, accompanied by a package of measures to deliver on our commitment to halve knife crime in a decade.”\nThe government has set out a pathway to bring down knife crime:\nA new Young Futures programme – with new Prevention Partnerships and youth hubs so we can intervene earlier to prevent at-risk young people from being drawn into violent crime\nA ban on ninja sorts and fines for senior social media execs who fail to remove illegal knife crime content from their platforms\nOnline retailers to be forced to ask anyone buying a knife for two types of identification, with buyers asked to submit an identity document, such as a passport, and record a live video to prove their age\nA new coalition to tackle knife-enabled crime, working together with technology companies, sport organisations, the health service, the police, and the families of victims\nA new offence of criminal exploitation of children, to go after the gangs who are luring young people into violence and crime\nA plan to plan to place youth workers and mentors in A&E units and Pupil Referral Units, to identify and help those children and young people who are victims of serious violence and exploitation\nENDS",

From 2011 to 2024, the waiting list at University Hospitals Birmingham Trust shot up from 21,000 to approximately 127,000, leaving thousands of people suffering or in pain waiting for treatment.\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to bring down hospital waiting times.\nThe Prime Minister announced that we will:\n- Slash NHS waiting times from 18 months to 18 weeks so millions of patients no longer have to have their lives put on hold waiting for treatment\n- Expand community diagnostic centres (CDCs) and surgical hubs for faster, local treatment outside hospitals\n- Make sure CDCs will operate longer hours (12 hours a day, seven days a week) to increase access to same-day tests and consultations, with up to half a million extra appointments annually\n- Free up one million appointments annually by abolishing automatic follow-ups unless requested by patients\n- Make a new deal with private clinics to treat NHS patients – with particular emphasis on joint operations and gynaecological procedures\n- Simplify and promote patient choice of which hospitals to be treated in to address low uptake\n- Prevent unnecessary referrals as GPs will be funded to work with hospital doctors to get specialist advice before making referrals\n- Create 14 surgical hubs within existing hospitals by June to handle routine procedures like cataract and orthopaedic surgeries which will operate separately from other hospital areas to ensure operating time isn’t affected by emergencies\n- Cut the number of patients waiting over 18 weeks by 450,000 by March 2026\n- Aim for 65% of patients to start treatment or receive an all-clear within 18 weeks by March 2026, progressing toward the 92% NHS target by 2029\n- Use AI to predict and reduce missed appointments and improve resource allocation\n- Reward trusts who make the fastest improvements in cutting waiting times with additional funding for capital projects tailored to local needs\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“In my constituency, I’ve seen waiting lists skyrocket, leaving thousands of my constituents suffering or in pain with their lives on hold. I’ve heard from too many doctors, nurses and other dedicated staff who are unable to give the standard of care they desperately want to.\n“Investment and radical reform can turn this around and that is what our Labour government is focused on delivering.”\n“The reforms we are launching will free up millions of appointments and cut waiting lists, so the NHS can be there for us when we need it once again.”\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said:\n“This Government promised change and that is what I am fighting every day to deliver.\n“NHS backlogs have ballooned in recent years, leaving millions of patients languishing on waiting lists, often in pain or fear. Lives on hold. Potential unfulfilled.\n“This elective reform plan will deliver on our promise to end the backlogs. Millions more appointments. Greater choice and convenience for patients. Staff once again able to give the standard of care they desperately want to.\n“This is a key plank of our Plan for Change, which will drive growth that puts more money in people’s pockets, secures our borders and makes the NHS fit for the future so what working people live longer, healthier, more prosperous lives.”\nENDS\nNotes:\n- University Hospitals Birmingham waiting list revealed as thousands on hold for treatment - Birmingham Live – https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/university-hospitals-birmingham-waiting-list-29392026",

Watch their full speeches here:\nFeeling secure is the bedrock on which opportunities are built, communities can thrive, and local economies can prosper. But our sense of security has eroded over the past 13 years as levels of violent crime have become far too high, and confidence that there will be any consequences when a crime is committed is too low.\nThe Government has hollowed out neighbourhood policing, allowed vulnerable young people to be drawn into crime and violence, and allowed confidence in the police and criminal justice system to collapse. There has been systematic failure to tackle violence against women and girls. Criminals are being let off while victims are let down.\nTackling this effectively is a huge challenge and is a social justice issue – with those who are vulnerable or on low incomes, being much less likely to feel safe or secure. But it can’t be done by tinkering with a single policy change. We need system change across Government, public services and society to fix it.\nLabour will meet this challenge and make Britain’s streets safe as the second of our five driving missions. Our second mission in government is to halve serious violent crime and raise confidence in the police and criminal justice system to its highest levels.\nWithin a decade, our second mission will:\nHalve the level of violence against women and girls.\nHalve the incidents of knife crime.\nRaise confidence in every police force to its highest levels.\nReverse the collapse in the proportion of crimes solved\nPresenting your petitions in Parliament\nRecently, several residents have contacted me requesting my support with their local petitions. I was only too happy to help them and over the last fortnight have had the pleasure of presenting them in Parliament.\nThe first petition declared that the cost of living has reached crisis point, with the consequence being an increase in homelessness and fellow constituents being left to go cold and hungry. The petitioners therefore requested the Government to take urgent action that will see:\n1. An extension of the windfall tax to cover the costs of capping energy rates to stop bills going up this winter.\n2.Insulate homes to help families save money on their energy bills now and in the long-term.\n3. Support homeowners to protect their homes by bringing interest rates down on mortgages.\n4. Protect those who pay rent to ensure a sudden spike in rent prices does not lead to an increase in homelessness.\nThe second petition related to speeding and dangerous driving on Osmaston Road in Harborne. This is an issue which residents have been campaigning for change for several years. They therefore urged the Government to work with Birmingham City Council Highways Department and West Midlands Police to address the concerns of the residents to prevent dangerous speeding.\nBoth of these petitions will now be printed in Hansard (a formal record of parliament) and a government response should be provided within two months. The petitions committee may then also consider further action where appropriate.\nShould you have a petition you would like me to present to Parliament on your behalf, please let get in touch on 0121 392 8426 or preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk\nNorth Edgbaston attack on elderly resident\nOn Monday, an elderly man was set alight in a horrifying attack on Shenstone Road in North Edgbaston as he walked home from Dudley Road Mosque. While this is not part of our constituency, it is on the border, and I know that many people will often travel to this part of the city. It is why I wanted to offer you this reassurance.\nWhile we do not yet know the reasons for the attack, I am pleased to see the action West Midlands Police has taken to immediately investigate and the steps taken to reassure the local community with extra Police officers. A man remains in custody after being arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The Police is also working with partner agencies such as Birmingham City Council to ensure the safety of the local community.\nI myself grew up on Shenstone Road and so know this area well. It is a vibrant and diverse community and doesn’t suffer from community tensions that could lead to such an awful attack. It is what makes this event so much more shocking. I sincerely hope the victim makes a swift recovery and my thoughts are with them and their family.\nApply to join my team!\nI’m recruiting a new caseworker role in my constituency office in Edgbaston. Edgbaston constituency covers Harborne, Bartley Green, Quinton, Edgbaston and part of North Edgbaston.\nThe cost of living is having a significant impact on residents across the constituency. I have seen this first hand as the number of people contacting me and looking for support has significantly increased with requests ranging from immigration to housing, benefits to health requests. That is why I am looking for someone with experience with casework whether that is in the public sector, at a charity or another fast-paced role.\nSo, if you have a passion for helping people and want to join my brilliant team, please look at the job description and apply. The closing date is 12 April at 5pm.\nMy next advice surgery date\nMy advice surgeries for all wards except Edgbaston, fall on the first Friday of the month. Unfortunately, April’s advice surgery will fall on Good Friday which is a bank holiday and so they will be cancelled. My next advice surgery date will be Thursday 13 April at Edgbaston Community Centre between 10.30-11.30am.\nIn the meantime, if you would like my support with any issue, please get in touch on 0121 392 8426 or preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk and I would be more than happy to help.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

This is a crisis that the government created – after 13 years of Tory failure and a kamikaze budget that crashed the economy, it’s families paying the price.\nMy constituents in Edgbaston will likely be worried. Analysis has revealed that 7,400 families in Edgbaston will face an annual mortgage payment increase of £2,600 this year. This is a disgrace. Labour has called on the Government to urgently adopt temporary measures to provide immediate relief to struggling mortgage borrowers.\nIf people are worried about paying their mortgages, they should pick up the phone to their lender who'll help them come up with a plan.\nThis week in Parliament, MPs also voted to approve the damning Privileges Committee Report on Boris Johnson, confirming that he repeatedly misled Parliament about lockdown parties at Downing Street. I was not able to be in Parliament due to illness, but I want to reassure my constituents that I would have voted in favour of the report and indorse the sanctions in full.\nThe Government is consumed in law-breaking, chaos and infighting while families across Britain face a mortgage crisis. The Tories are wildly out of touch with the reality facing millions of families.\nOnly Labour will bring financial and economic security back!\nThe Times Red Box\nThis week, I wrote a piece for The Times Red Box about Labour’s green development plan. The green transition depends on development, and development needs the green transition. Ultimately, as we shift globally to green energy, we must commit to delivering fairer finance for countries on the frontline of the climate crisis.\nIn fact, this week dozens of world leaders have been at a Paris summit hosted by President Macron. Their aim is to do nothing less than starting to unlock the billions of additional finance needed to tackle climate change, poverty and global inequality in low- and middle-income countries. But Sunak didn’t show up. Once again, Britain is missing in action, breaking our word and international commitments.\nLabour will lead by example, reconnecting Britain with allies and partners to set up fairer greener finance and combat the climate crisis.\nWomen’s National Team of Afghanistan\nThis week, I and over 100 parliamentarians wrote to FIFA requesting they stand by their statutes and support the Women’s National Team of Afghanistan.\nThe letter was inspired by a recent call to action from education activist Malala Yousafzai and former captain of the Women’s National Team of Afghanistan Khalida Popal, to support the team and defend women’s right to play sports competitively.\nWhen the Taliban regained power in the country in 2021, it immediately banned women’s representation in sports, meaning that women of all national teams, from the senior teams down to the youth teams, were denied the chance to represent their country at international level, in addition to the total abolition of women’s sports at a grassroots level.\nWith this year being a World Cup year, co-hosted by Australia, the time for action is now.\nFly-tipping\nFly tipping sadly remains a huge issue for our constituency, blighting our communities and leading to further problems like rodent infestations. I see this daily in the e-mails that land in my inbox and through the telephone calls made to my office. In the last month alone, I’ve received upwards of twenty individual reports of fly tipping in Bartley Green alone – all of which I have reported to the Council for urgent clearance.\nLast week, I took this issue to the top of government, tabling questions to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for which I received answers this week. You can find my questions and the answers provided by clicking the button below.\nI now plan to use the information provided by the Government to work with Birmingham City Council and others to tackle this crime. It must be made easier to report fly-tipping, information needs be more widely available to residents, and the Council must use all its resources to get on top of this issue and to ensure appropriate action is taken against those responsible.\nI will continue to speak up for residents to tackle this nuisance in our constituency.\nLocal News\nIt’s been revealed that Edgbaston is in the top-ranking constituencies for the uptake of The Healthy Start Scheme. 1,178 residents signed up to the Government’s Scheme – which provides pregnant women or pre-school aged children in low-income households with a weekly payment to spend on healthy foods – out of 1,704 who were eligible.\nTo commemorate 75 years of the Windrush Generation, The National Lottery Community Fund donated £10,000 to Wheelchair Recycling We Can Do, a charity based in our constituency. The funding was used to put on a full day’s activities to mark the milestone of the 75th year of Windrush. The project aims to educate people to understand our Windrush Elders' struggles to build Great Britain and provide the necessary support.\nThe Mobile Household Recycling Centre will be visiting Kelmscott Road (B17 8QW) on 28th June and Hasbury Road on 29th June (B32 4EE). The Recycling Centre will be there between 07:00 and 12:45. Please come along if you’re local and have bulky household waste to dispose of.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nBirmingham Edgbaston covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and Quinton",

Preet called for an independent investigation and was concerned that the local Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board (ICB) has announced a rapid 3-part review into UHB without discussing with key stakeholders in the region.\nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham manages several hospitals, serves 2.2 million people and has a staff of 22,500 making it one of the largest employers in Birmingham Edgbaston constituency and one of the biggest Trusts in the UK.\nSince speaking to Newsnight, the Birmingham MP has said that she has been inundated by messages from UHB staff, past and present, who have contacted her to share their experience of what has been repeatedly described as a toxic culture that has had an alarming impact on staff and patient care.\nPreet Kaur Gill MP said, “I am gravely concerned by the messages I’ve received following the Newsnight investigation. The story I am hearing time and again is that staff who raised concerns about something that they thought was putting patients at risk were often ignored and then penalised for doing so with whistleblowers describing to me a “put up or shut up” culture. The allegations made by whistleblowers add strong evidence to a wider cultural problem that includes senior executive leadership, consultants and nursing.\n“We cannot rely on an ICB investigation to solve this issue. Many of those on the ICB are former members of the senior leadership team from UHB and would not offer the independence required to recommend the changes that are so needed or give confidence to whistleblowers. Many messages I have received say that the Newsnight investigation is just “the tip of the iceberg”. Given this has all happened under the watch of the UHB Boards, I do not see how their position as board members remains tenable. For the sake of staff and patient safety alike, we cannot allow these serious allegations to be whitewashed.\n“As I said in my letter to the health secretary, there has been a complete failure of leadership, failure of governance and a failure of regulation that must be unearthed and addressed.”\nRead my full letter to Steve Barclay MP including anonymous testimonials from staff here:",

  "https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_/https_www_preetkaurgill_co_uk_post_my-weekly-update-26-july-24/content_68.html": "My Weekly Update - 26 July\n- Preet Kaur Gill MP\n- Jul 26, 2024\n- 5 min read\nDear all,\nI began this week by speaking at event organised by 50:50 Parliament and Chamber UK, on the subject of women’s health.\nOne thing I have always sought to do with the privilege of my platform is highlight the stories and voices of remarkable women who have changed our country for the better. Through history they often do not get the credit they deserve, so where I can, I always try to pay tribute to those women and other forgotten figures who blazed a trail before us.\nOne such local hero, who you might not have heard about before, is Dame Hilda Lloyd.\nDame Hilda Nora Lloyd was the first woman to be elected president of a UK medical royal college, becoming President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1949. In 2022, I was honoured to join the opening of the Dame Hilda Lloyd Network in Women’s Health Research in our constituency.\nIn the 1930s, Dame Hilda became famed for the so-called “flying squads,” where groups of midwives used then new gas and air technology to provide emergency care and transfusions at the scene to women giving birth. Back then, our country was facing an epidemic of maternal deaths. Backstreet abortions were rife, with countless women dying of complications like sepsis. On the frontline in Birmingham, Dame Hilda saw first-hand the relationship between poverty, women’s rights and maternal health, and dedicated her life to improving outcomes for women.\nIt was a pleasure to speak about Dame Hilda’s work to transform maternal healthcare in the last century this week, because at the beginning of this new parliament and government, her pioneering work still holds lessons for us now.\nIn 2024, women’s health is too often an afterthought. The UK has one of the largest female health gaps in the world, and the largest in the G20. Women are underrepresented in clinical trials; surveys show we often feel like we are not listened to properly by medical professionals; and the national state of maternity care is still, too often, poor.\nI’m pleased that Labour has set an ambition to improve the state of maternity care by training thousands more midwives and health visitors, and incentivising continuity of care for women across their pregnancy. In particular, it is welcome that the Health Secretary has set an explicit target to end the black maternal mortality gap, which means black mothers in the UK are 4x more likely to die than white women.\nBut with nearly 600,000 women on a waiting lists for hospital-based gynaecological services, the new government has a lot of work to do!\nI’m looking forward to working with women and organisations like 50:50 Parliament to raise the profile of these issues in the new Parliament, so we can take new strides forward to improve women’s health.\nBirmingham will host the Invictus Games\nI was thrilled to see the announcement this week that Birmingham will be the host city of the 2027 Invictus Games.\nThe Invictus Games are an inspiring sports event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women, both serving and veterans. It is a great sign of our city’s strong reputation as the host of major sporting events, following the Commonwealth Games the other year.\nThe Games will offer an opportunity to promote skills, training, and encouragement for young people in the city, including through volunteering opportunities and a schools engagement programme. The Games will also be an opportunity to show Birmingham as an exciting and vibrant place to visit, to support our tourism and visitor economy.\nBirmingham has proudly played a leading role in treating Armed Forces personnel and Veterans at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in my constituency. With our proud links with the Armed Forces, and nearly 2,000 servicemen and women in our constituency, I’m very proud that Birmingham will be hosting the Invictus Games in three years' time.\nThe Olympic Games begin\nToday is the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Paris. I and everyone is wishing everyone in Team GB the best of luck as they go for gold in this year’s contest.\nIn particular, I want to give special mention to Joe Fraser, from our constituency. He will be competing for Team GB in gymnastics, after he managed to bring home a stunning three gold medals in the team, pommel horse and parallel bars events at the Commonwealth Games.\nJoe’s first event is on Monday, and I’m sure you will join me in wishing him the very best of luck.\nVisiting Birmingham and Solihull Women's Aid\nIt was great to have the opportunity this week to visit Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid to see the brilliant work they are doing at the new Theresa Stewart Women's Centre.\nAs a former children’s services manager in the city, I worked with victims and families affected by domestic violence day in and day out.\nI look forward to working with them to support survivors of domestic violence and abuse. Their helpline is 0808 800 0028.\nNational crime spree under the Conservatives\nThis week, in a local Co-op, a shopfloor assistant told my team that they were quitting their job because of having to constantly deal with shoplifters.\nNew data released by the ONS this week shows that shoplifting is at its highest level in 20 years. Far too often, it is shop workers who pay the price, with hassle, abuse, lost margins, and even violence the result.\nThis wasn’t inevitable. It is a result of the Conservatives stripping back community policing and weakening efforts to tackle so-called “low value” crime, which has meant police forces effectively ignore thefts valued at under £200.\nThe new statistics released this week also revealed robbery up 8% year-on-year, and a staggering 40% increase in theft from the person in just a year.\nUnder the Tories, criminals have never had it so good. Labour has pledged to recruit 13,000 new community police officers and PCSOs and to pass a law to make assaults and abuse against shop workers a specific offence.\nI'm hiring\nI am currently recruiting for a new Personal Assistant to join my team in my office in London.\nIf you have the skills and experience, and want to work in Parliament at an exciting juncture for the Labour Party and the country, please consider applying by clicking the button below.\nMeeting the Board of Deputies\nThis week it was wonderful to catch up with Philip Rosenberg, the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. We discussed opportunities for\nthe BOD to work with Sikhs to see both communities included under ethnicity as well as under religion in the Census and other monitoring frameworks.\nBetter Streets for Birmingham\nAs part of my ongoing campaign to address the spate of road collisions, dangerous driving and speeding incidents in our constituency, it was great to sit down with Better Streets for Birmingham to discuss next steps today.\nI know this is a huge issue for many residents, and I look forward to working with you and other stakeholders to bring the change we need.\nBest wishes,\nPreet Kaur Gill MP\nMember of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston, covering Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne, North Edgbaston and Quinton",

The Edgbaston bid that was submitted, sought to inject a total of £20 million into the constituency which would have funded a range of new community and cultural facilities. This included money for a community hub at the former Quinton Police Station building to provide support for youth provision and local training and reskilling.\nPreet Kaur Gill, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said, “What’s clear is that instead of working for meaningful change and true levelling up, the Conservatives are once again putting their party first and the country second. The biggest regional recipients are those where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to losing marginal seats to Labour. It’s not fair or right that London gets £151m while Birmingham receives nothing.\n“It takes an extraordinary arrogance to expect us to be grateful for a partial refund on the money they have stripped out of our communities and for Birmingham, it is even worse as we received nothing.\n“In my constituency of Edgbaston, this money would have made a real difference to people’s lives, particularly in Quinton. We understand the needs and gaps in our communities around youth provision, getting people back into work, early years support and where so many people are struggling with the cost of living crisis. The Government has let all of these people down.”",

These new powers are included in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill.\nGill has long been campaigning to shut down a legal loophole that means it is currently legal to possess and share blueprints to print 3D guns. In October 2024, Gill presented the Firearms (3D Printing) Bill to Parliament, \"to create an offence of possessing a blueprint for the production of a firearm by 3D printing”. She also worked with Channel 4 documentary makers Middlechild TV to raise awareness of the issue and bring it to the attention of Parliament.\nBlueprints to make untraceable lethal weapons can now be shared and downloaded easily with a step by step guide available on social media platforms and manufactured with 3D printers that can be bought for as little as £150, presenting a real challenge to law enforcement agencies trying to stop the circulation of firearms on Britain's streets.\nThe rise of 3D printed guns is a serious concern. Since 2021, the National Crime Agency has reported a 733% rise in the number of cases involving the seizure of 3D printed firearms and components during targeted police searches.\nLast year in Birmingham, a local man was convicted of possession of a range of home-made assault rifles manufactured with a 3D printer at home.\nThe lethal potential of this technology received international media attention after the Luigi Mangione case in New York, where a health insurance CEO was murdered with an untraceable “ghost gun”, parts of which were 3D-printed.\nResponding to the announcement, Preet Kaur Gill, Member of Parliament for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said:\n“Last year, I presented the Firearms (3D Printing) Bill to Parliament, to shut down a loophole that means it is legal to possess or share a blueprint to make 3D-printed guns, or part-make a 3D-printed gun.\n“I am delighted this week the Government announced it will take forward my Bill and close this loophole.\n“As organised crime changes, legislation must keep up. Templates to make untraceable lethal weapons can now be shared and downloaded easily via social media, and with hostile actors using social media and other platforms to stir and incite violence on Britain’s streets, it is imperative we act.\n“I am delighted that the Government has taken swift action, sending a strong message to criminals seeking to exploit this loophole.

Therefore, I am pleased to share an exciting opportunity for students to explore studying in the United States.\nThe Sutton Trust US Programme is run in partnership with US study experts the US-UK Fulbright Commission and aims to give students an insight into what it would be like to study in the US, with expert admissions and scholarship support if they decide that that is a path they would like to take.\nStudents learn about the US admissions process at two residentials in the spring, allowing them to make friends with peers from across the UK and benefit from support from expert advisers throughout the process, including in-depth preparation for financial aid and scholarship applications. Students also have the opportunity to explore US universities on a week long trip to the US, which we plan to run this year.\nIf they then decide to apply to US universities, the programme will guide them through the process, with events and expert advice from the Fulbright advisors, including support in applying for scholarships and financial aid.\nThis is a fully funded programme so the Sutton Trust will cover all costs, including travel, residential events, accommodation, and food.\nParticipants who complete the programme leave with increased confidence and admissions skills, whether they choose to pursue study in the US or not, with participants four and a half times more likely to receive an offer from a top university than their peers. Many participants go on to study in the US, with more than 500 Sutton Trust US Programme students being admitted to 74 US universities across the country since the programme began.\n“Being on the Sutton Trust US Programme, and ultimately studying in the US, are the two single most life-changing experiences I have had so far. Once a timid teenager, they have given me a platform to grow into the ambitious, curious and confident woman that I am today.” – Hollie from Liverpool, Middlebury College Class of 2019.\nYou can visit the Sutton Trust US programme website at https://us.suttontrust.com/ for more information and promotional materials. You can also contact the Sutton Trust US Programme at suttontrust@fulbright.org.uk\nSutton Trust’s partners, the US-UK Fulbright Commission are also the EducationUSA centre for the UK, and provide free, unbiased advice for anyone who wants to study at a US university – so even if students are not eligible for this programme, there is help and support available: Fulbright.org.uk.'\nIf any educator, parent, or student would like to discuss the above with Preet further, please contact preet.gill.mp@parliament.uk or telephone 0121 392 8426.",
