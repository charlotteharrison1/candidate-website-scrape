This will help identify how to reduce bills through measures such as improving or installing new energy features in the building, or changing how energy is used. This part of the scheme is now open for applications, and will remain open until August 2024.\nOrganisations with an energy assessment may then be eligible to apply for a capital grant of between £2000 and £150,000 to install the recommended energy efficiency measures in their premises. This part of the scheme will open to applications in January 2024 and grant rounds will also run until August 2024.\nGrant awards will be decided through a competitive process, seeking applications from eligible organisations. Further information on the eligibility criteria and details on how to apply can be found through the following links:\nVCSE Energy Efficiency Scheme - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)\nVCSE Energy Efficiency Scheme - Groundwork",

  "http_www_nigelhuddleston_com_/http_www_nigelhuddleston_com_news_emergency-budget-response/content_19.html": "This week’s Spring Statement is very concerning. The Government’s approach is economically incoherent and politically dishonest. The Chancellor is attempting to rectify a situation that is entirely of her own making.\nThis is not a moment of fiscal responsibility, but rather an exercise in damage control. The Chancellor is now scrambling to identify savings because, in the October Budget, the Government chose to increase spending by £70 billion, raise taxes by £40 billion and accumulate £30 billion in debt to finance it. As a result, the public is now bearing the cost of additional spending they neither voted for nor were informed about. Little of this extra expenditure was outlined in Labour’s manifesto.\nIt is classic Labour: spend other people’s money and then pass the bill onto them. As Margaret Thatcher wisely stated, “The problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.” This is precisely the situation Labour finds itself in.\nWhile I welcome the increase in defence spending — a policy long supported by Conservatives — it is clear that the Government is attempting to frame the announcements as difficult yet necessary choices. In reality, these choices are only necessary because of Labour’s mismanagement of the economy. The most telling evidence of this is the significant reduction in the economic growth forecast, which has been halved to just 1%.\nI will continue to hold this Government to account.",

The constituency lies entirely within the Wychavon District Council area, but does not include Inkberrow, Harvington & Norton, and most of the Dodderhill ward, all of which are in the neighbouring constituency of Redditch. Similarly, both Bredon Hill and the Pershore area falls within West Worcestershire.\nThe biggest towns in the constituency are Droitwich Spa and Evesham. The constituency is 35 miles long and stretches from Broadway on the border with Gloucestershire in the south to Hartlebury in the north - almost to Kidderminster. It takes an hour to drive from one end of the constituency to the other.\nThe constituency is predominantly rural. Agriculture, light industry, and services (such as retail as well as professional services) are the main private sector employers - and hospitality and leisure is also a major contributor to the local economy, particularly in the south around the popular tourist centres of Broadway and Evesham.\nThe Conservatives control both Wychavon District Council and Worcestershire County Council.\nTo find things to do in the local area, take a look at:\nVisit Worcestershire\nVisit Wychavon",
