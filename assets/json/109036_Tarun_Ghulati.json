  "https_www_tarunghulati_com_/https_www_tarunghulati_com_policy-ideas/content_7.html": "Independent Candidate\nfor Mayor of London\nPolicy Ideas\nAs Mayor of London, I will work tirelessly and selflessly for all Londoners. I want to hear from all communities about the issues impacting them. This is why I am engaging directly with communities and businesses across all sectors to work together to secure London's bright future.\nMaking London\nSafe For All\nSafety is paramount for our communities.\nLondoners do not feel safe anywhere, anytime, anymore. Women feel unsafe. London has failed its youth with gang warfare spreading. Criminal exploitation of children is increasing.\nHas the current Mayor of London forgotten he is responsible for the totality of policing?\nToo many Londoners are\nimpacted by crime. This must\nstop.\n- I will create dedicated units to tackle crime.\n- Increased and urgent focus on violence and crime against women.\n- Ensure visible on the beat community policing.\n- Re-open police stations where crime rates are high\n- Measure each police officer's performance strictly against crime reduction and prevention goals\nOne life lost is one too many\nGetting London Moving\nThis is hampering London’s economic growth,having been ranked as the most congested city in the world\nThe Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) is a disaster whilst Tubes, buses, roads are all clogged. The Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) are not helping.\nIs the current Mayor of London not aware his policies have brought London and Londoners to a standstill?\nCosts have increased for Londoners and businesses with these policies and low-incomehouseholds are impacted. A total revamp is essential.\n- I will scrap ULEZ.\n- LTNs will be abolished.\n- Congestion Charge will be removed over weekends and holidays.\n- Additional resources will be provided to minimise noise pollution.\nI will ensure the transport system is efficient, effective, fair and equitable for all.\nLevelling up for Londoners\nAround 25% of Londoners and over 33% of Children live in poverty,\nThis is shocking and totally unacceptable Children, women, people living with disabilities and long-term conditions, people from minority ethnic groups, lone parents and people who are socially excluded, such as rough sleepers and many others with low income levels are struggling to cope.\nHas the current Mayor of London forgotten his moral responsibility to ensure the wellbeing of all Londoners?\nThis is a top priority London is broken.\n- I will deliver genuinely affordable homes.\n- The voice of Londoners will be encouraged in new housing plans\n- Standards of temporary accommodations will be improved by working closely with boroughs.\n- Will fight for making childcare more affordable for claimants.\n- I will use my independent voice to lobby hard against the Government’s two-child benefit cap and for increasing child benefit.\n- I will ensure free school meals.\n- Will unlock employment opportunities by encouraging further investment in London.\n- Will increase funding for benefit, debt and welfare legal advice services and make them more effective.\n- I will work with the business community to create more flexible employment opportunities.\nI will bring back the smile for all Londoners.\nStrengthening\nLondon’s Communities\nCommunities are feeling isolated in London, there is a growing sense of social dislocation, inequalities created by poor policies have exacerbated the problem.\nLondon feels like a lonely place to live for many, lack of adequate community facilities, work, skills and employment opportunities affecting many, lower engagement with families unsure of housing, volunteering by fewer people, not enough government or council funding, youth are leaving their communities.\nHas the current Mayor of London not realised many of his policies have left communities struggling and made them insular?\nCreating cohesiveness and bringing communities together is critical\n- I will strengthen relationships between neighbours and neighbourhoods through a community cohesion strategy.\n- Will celebrate the diversity of London’s communities by championing the voices of young people through the creation of borough led youth councils.\n- Volunteers and volunteering will bea key plank strategy through a Mayor of London Volunteering fund.\n- I will use my independent voice to lobby hard against the Government’s two-child benefit cap and for increasing child benefit.\n- Sports and culture will be fostered like never before.\n- Sustainability and environment will be areas of focus.\n- Will create a Mayoral Statement of Community Involvement Happy communities mean thriving communities all working with the same goal for their own London.\nI will work tirelessly and selflessly across communities and boroughs.\nChampioning London\nThe leadership and ambition to spearhead and develop sustainable prosperity and redefine London’s pitch to the world has been lacking.\nLondon needs a Champion to continually showcase its unique strengths and sectors. The business ecosystem needs to be world leading and world beating. More Fortune 500 companies need to make London their Global Headquarters.\nThe current Mayor of London forgot he should have Championed London from the front?\nLondon is a great city with so\nmuch offer to everyone. It is competing with other cities on many fronts. Needs to be showcased.\n- I will Champion London globally and be a credible partner for business and strengthen its international competitiveness across all sectors.\n- Take strong borough-level action to handle inequality, develop skills and encourage investment.\n- Urgent steps to reduce emissions and increase focus on sustainability.\n- Ensure my levelling up agenda gives London a boost and makes it an investment destination of choice.\n- Invest in Infrastructure to ensure growth.\n- Entrepreneurial spirit will be invigorated and revived, Startups, Scaleups and SMEs will be fostered, will make London a leader in ethical and responsible technology, USA is currently funding around 60% of Venture rounds.\n- Ensure UK only funds have the resources, training and expertise to grow the investment ecosystem.\n- Tourism needs a refocus.\n- Commit to electric vehicles and steady investment in TfL.\n- Ensure a sensible approach and support towards net zero.\n- Remove all barriers to ensure London is the most digitally connected city.\n- Invest in people upskilling and ensure London is attractive for talent.\nAs London's champion I will not be afraid to make bold moves to secure our place as the best city in the world.\nSubscribe\nDon’t miss out: get important updates about London\n\"*\" indicates required fields",

He’s a relentless mentor, tirelessly guiding and\ninspiring the next generation across a staggering 44 countries to date. His efforts haven’t gone unnoticed, earning recognition from media outlets in more than 80 nations. But Tarun’s passion doesn’t stop there. He is a dream-weaver for startups and scale-ups, igniting their aspirations with a special focus on fueling growth in the United Kingdom, India, USA and other markets. What truly sets Tarun apart is his illustrious history.\nTarun Ghulati’s commitment to public service is ingrained in a legacy of unwavering dedication. His family heritage, steeped in service to society for over 140 years, sandwiched between three\ncenturies, the 19th, 20th and 21st, serves as a guiding light.\nTarun’s father, a former Secretary to the Government of India, is a passionate advocate for uplifting farmers and promoting organic farming. His tireless efforts continue to have an indelible impact on\nseveral Indian States, as evidenced by the four reprints of his farmers working manual. Tarun’s paternal grandfather, an erudite scholar who studied in the UK in the early 1900’s, rose to become a senior civil servant in undivided India, later with the Republic of India leaving behind a profound\nlegacy of public service.

I want to transform London by engaging with Londoners and utilise resources effectively and efficiently to ensure transformational and tangible change.\nI am standing as an independent candidate to become the next Mayor of London because I want to encourage the free flow of ideas and policies without party ideology and bias.\nLondon’s vision should not be blurred by party lines.\nLondon is about the people not the politics.\nThese are unprecedented and challenging times, that require mature, steady and growth driven leadership. As the Mayor of London, I will ensure London becomes the first choice for investment to ensure safety and prosperity for all. I want to make London the Greatest City and bring back the smile, the pride, and the mojo for all Londoners.\nStay Connected\nDon’t miss out: get important updates about London\nSubscribe\nDon’t miss out: get important updates about London\n\"*\" indicates required fields",
