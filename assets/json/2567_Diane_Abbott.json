There are serious allegations which Amber Rudd cannot simply brush away. Campaigners, the wider public and Parliament will not let this rest.\n- You can read my recent piece on why Labour will overturn the Tories’ disgraceful decision to deny an Orgreave Inquiry here\nA Labour Government will scrap the disgraceful bedroom tax\nThe Government faced embarrassment over the bedroom tax last week, when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Jacqueline Carmichael, saying she could not share a bedroom with her husband because of her disabilities, and Sue and Paul Rutherford, the grandparents of a severely disabled child who needs an additional room for the child's overnight carer.\nResponding, Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said: “I would like to pay tribute to all the families for their tireless work on bringing this issue to court. The true cruelty of the Tories bedroom tax has been exposed in today’s judgement,” adding that “the bedroom tax is a cruel and unnecessary policy. It is widely despised by the British public, who see it for what it is; a callous attempt to punish low-income, social housing tenants.”\nA Labour Government will scrap the disgraceful bedroom tax - ending the misery faced by thousands across the country.\nTeresa May needs to catch up - The Conservatives have presided over ballooning inequality\nResponding to Prime Minister Teresa May’s speech this Monday, Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Labour Party said:\n“Theresa May is trying to catch up with a changing world the Conservatives do not understand.\n“There can’t be a globalisation that works for all without taking on the billionaires club that controls this rigged system.\n“The Conservatives have presided over ballooning inequality. They’ve given tax cuts to the richest 1 percent while the incomes of 70 percent have stagnated or fallen.\n“Labour will take on the interests holding our country back. We will invest to rebuild and transform Britain, so no-one and no community is left behind.”\n- You can read Jeremy Corbyn’s speech this weekend responding to Donald Trump’s election here.\nNHS crisis deepens – Tories have no answers\nUnder the Tories, hospitals are facing financial crisis while patient care suffers. The latest combined performance data from NHS England show that:\n- Too many people are waiting too long in overcrowded Accident and Emergency departments.\n- The ambulance figures show that some of the most seriously ill emergency patients are waiting way beyond the target time.\n- The number of days lost to delayed discharges from hospitals is at a record high.\nAs my Shadow Cabinet Colleague Jonathan Ashworth put it, “The Tory mishandling of the NHS is nothing short of a disgrace: people are waiting longer, A&Es are in crisis, social care is being squeezed and staff morale is plunging.”\nThis Conservative Government is taking our health service backwards. These figures are bad news for patients and the Government needs to take urgent action.\n- Labour is holding a national campaign day of action for the NHS on October 26 – you can sign up for email updates and pledge to take part here.\nRefugees – Reports of children’s hunger strikes very worrying\nIt has been reported this week that three Afghan children are going on hunger strike to protest being held in France when they have relatives in Britain.\nIn response, I issued a press release saying “These reports are deeply disturbing. Amber Rudd should investigate them as a matter of urgency.\n“The break-up of the refugee camp in Calais has driven the issue off the headlines. But the crisis is unresolved.\n“The Government must tell all these children and all refugees entitled to be here when they can expect to be admitted. There has already been too little done to support vulnerable children, and too much harm done to them.”\n- You can read my recent Guardian article on the refugee crisis and “how unless they stop passing off refugees as somebody else’s problem, this government will go down as the one that watched while thousands suffered” here.\nback ⇢",

Tough laws are needed to end it\nCurrently the Criminal Finances Bill is going through Parliament. Labour has tabled amendments with the aim of expanding the bill to include Britain’s tax havens. We hold the position that they should publish the names of the individuals behind the shell companies registered there.\nIn its current state the Bill is lax on tackling this major issue and needs to be strengthened significantly. The quasi-autonomous status of Overseas Territories cannot be a barrier to our role in tackling international money-laundering. We must face up to our responsibilities and end the UK’s role in this global scandal.\n- You can read my full article on the issue here.\nSavage Tory Cuts have caused a crisis in the funding of social care\nThis week saw a number of news reports of proposed council tax rises to fund social care.\nThere is a crisis in the funding of social care caused by savage Tory cuts to the budgets of local councils. £4.6 Billion has been cut from adult social care since 2010, meaning 400,000 fewer people now have publicly funded care. Social Care failures also affect the wider NHS with record numbers of patients delayed on discharge. One third of those delays are due to lack of social care.\nAs my colleague Barbara Keeley MP, Shadow Minister for Social Care, commented “The right solution would be for Theresa May to admit the Tories have got it wrong and deliver the needed funding for social care. Asking taxpayers and councils to pick up the bill for the Tories’ failure is no substitute for a proper plan.”\nLeaders of local government and health organisations pleaded with the Chancellor to put the funding right in the Autumn Statement but he failed to do so. It is time for the Tories to deal with the crisis they have created and to develop a sustainable way of funding social care.\nNHS - Reports of seriously ill children waiting for hours for an intensive care bed\nThe Pediatric Intensive Care Society reported this week that some pediatric units are operating at 115% of capacity, with seriously ill children waiting for hours for an intensive care bed, and being transported as far as 120 miles from their homes to receive medical treatment.\nAs Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Health, put it \"It seems not a day goes by without another case of how the NHS is struggling to cope with the number of patients in our hospitals. What’s more, winter is only expected to make this worse, and Ministers don’t have a plan to ensure the NHS has the resources it needs.”\nMinisters failed to give the NHS and social care a single penny of extra investment in the Autumn Statement. Now, the Tories need to take urgent action to ensure that patients of all ages get the care they need.\nWe need to see some consistent principle in the UK’s foreign policy, not more shabby hypocrisy\nIn my previous role as Shadow International Development Minister, I highlighted how much more needed to be done to address the crisis in Yemen. And in October Labour called for Britain to suspend support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, until a lasting ceasefire has been brokered and until alleged violations of international humanitarian law have been properly investigated.\nThis weekend, my colleague Emily Thornberry MP, Labour’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, responded to Boris Johnson’s remarks about Saudi Arabia’s support for proxy wars in the Middle East, by pointing out that “For months, Labour has been arguing that what last year began as a UN-backed attempt to restore the government of Yemen has now descended into a brutal and indiscriminate proxy war, and a desperate humanitarian crisis, with the lives of hundreds of thousands of children at risk.”\nEarlier in the week, Kate Osamor MP, Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, responded to concerns voiced by the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, that the world is turning a “blind eye” to the conflict, saying: “The situation in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster, which has been far too neglected by the international community. The Tory Government has consistently refused to engage with the paradoxical nature of its engagement in the region: providing aid to assist a humanitarian situation which it is arguably complicit in exacerbating, through selling arms to Saudi Arabia despite the continuing risk that they are being used in breach of international humanitarian law.”\nInternational Students Benefit Us All. Government Policy Makes Us Poorer\nAs news broke this week that the Government is seeking to further restrict the number of international students coming to Britain, I have written a blog for The Huffington Post pointing out that “A number of stakeholders are opposed to the clampdown on overseas students, including Universities UK, the teaching unions, the National Union of Students, and many local authorities where education is a much-needed growth industry,” and concluding that “International students benefit us all. We should be trying to attract more of them, not driving them away.”\n- You can read the full article here.\nback ⇢",

The Western powers led by the US committed themselves to removing the Taliban, rebuilding the country and installing a functioning democracy with much greater equality. None of that has happened despite twenty years of bloodshed, destruction and death. We will soon see whether Britain and other Western countries will face up to their responsibilities to take in large numbers of refugees.\nSo, it is bizarre to see Western commentators as well as former Prime Minister Tony Blair criticise the decision to withdraw as ‘imbecilic’. Like the Bourbons they have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing.\nSome of us opposed the war at every stage, because it was wholly misconceived and morally indefensible. The idea of bombing and invading an entire country ostensibly to go after the former Western ally Osama bin Laden is preposterous. Yet this is what was claimed for the initial aggression against the people of Afghanistan. That NATO, purportedly a defensive organisation centred on the North Atlantic found itself at the centre of the action, only adds to the sense of the absurd.\nThe brilliant military strategists now clamouring for never-ending war failed to learn any lessons from history, either from the British Empire in Afghanistan or from the later failures of the Soviet forces. The Mujaheddin and other forces that the CIA unleashed against the Soviet-backed government in Kabul, and who gave rise to bin Laden and al Qaeda, were to prove the forerunners of the Taliban. The same Taliban that is now the nemesis of dreams of Empire.\nBut still those dreams persist. It is reported that Ben Wallace, no doubt under the instruction of his good friend Boris Johnson, was ringing around Western capitals in the hope that NATO forces minus the US could hold back the Taliban tide, even after the might of the US had failed to do so. The calls seem to have been given short shrift.\nIt is completely delusional for Western commentators, British officials and Tony Blair to believe there was a different course of action that could have saved Afghanistan from the insurgents. It was always unrealistic to believe that the machinery of war could lead to pacification of Afghanistan, let alone its development as a liberal democracy under military occupation. It is deranged to pretend that Britain could have played or could still play that role when the US could not.\nThere is almost a wilful disregard for the relative military capabilities of the US and of this country underlying these pretensions. There is too a complete disregard for the lives and views of ordinary Afghans.\nI was horrified by the situation in Afghanistan when I travelled there in 2010 as part of a parliamentary delegation. I wrote immediately on return that a timetable should be set for withdrawal. Soldiers told me that the Western forces were widely regarded as an army of occupation. Under those circumstances, we were never going to win hearts and minds.\nAt the same time, it is well-known that the Afghan terrain is ideal for an insurgent or guerrilla force. The US and its allies had unified their enemies and did not have the means to defeat them.\nIn addition, the level of widespread corruption was already apparent and the production of opium was soaring. Everything that the apologists for the war said would not happen was well entrenched. All the claims made by the architects of the war, such as Tony Blair were proving to be completely false. This was true 10 years ago, just as it was true 20 years ago.\nThe cornerstone of British foreign policy over decades now lies in ruins. Ever since Suez British governments have decided no truly independent foreign policy was possible and our fate was as an aide-de-camp for the US war machine. This meant that wherever that machine roamed, we had to be there, however dangerous it might be to British forces or our own interests, or however flimsy the pretext.\nIf there were no good reasons for the war, Britain would help invent them. Tony Blair, we can be sure, does remember ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and sexed-up dossiers. But he would do it all again, even if we now cannot ensure the safe return of our own citizens from Kabul, still less the safe passage of those who worked for this country.\nIt is no use bemoaning Biden, or abusing him personally as ministers now reportedly do. Trump also wanted to withdraw US troops and had a peace agreement with the Taliban to achieve that. The overwhelming majority in Washington wants out. And if the shareholders of arms manufacturers are unhappy, they may not have to wait too long for another major campaign, Iran perhaps, or China.\nIt would utterly stupid, or imbecilic in Blair’s word, to follow the US down its next road to war. The US will not protect this country from far more powerful enemies than the Taliban. The ‘special relationship’ did not merit even a phone call for advance warning of the pull-out.\nInstead, like other prosperous European countries we could adopt a pro-peace, pro-development foreign policy. We could welcome as refugees the Afghans we have so badly let down, far more than the government intends. We could cut offensive military capabilities and adopt a purely defensive posture. We could use the money saved to restore the aid budget, and increase social spending here. Above all, we could make our priorities based on principles of decency and mutual respect, not war-mongering and never-ending conflict.\nback ⇢",

The Tories have completely undermined the fire service with thousands of job cuts and by closing fire stations.\n“Ministers are recklessly complacent. Wildfires are often huge incidents requiring very large numbers of firefighters to tackle them. The UK has had more wildfires in the first half of 2019 than any year on record. As the effects of climate change worsen we need more firefighters and resources. It will be a complete dereliction of duty if ministers don’t make good their own cuts to the fire service.”\nback ⇢",

Furthermore, the Home Secretary and the Government propose to make a contribution towards legal fees only up to a fixed amount and will not reimburse for fees higher than that amount.\nThis is despite the fact that these legal costs, which are easily documented, were incurred in challenging wrongful loss of jobs, deprivation of public services including the NHS, loss of home, wrongful detention and wrongful deportation.\nThere will be also no compensation for private healthcare for persons living in this country who were unable to access the NHS care they were entitled to.\nJust over year on from the eruption of the Windrush scandal, it’s vital to keep up the pressure on this issue, both to find out the truth about what really happened, and in terms of the ongoing fight for justice for the victims of the scandal.\nIt’s particularly important to remember just what the Windrush scandal has involved, namely British citizens being wrongly deported, being prevented from returning home, being denied cancer treatment and vital healthcare, and many losing their jobs.\nNow, after having their lives torn apart, what the victims of the scandal are being offered in terms of compensation is totally inadequate, having already faced this long delay.\nLabour is clear that this compensation scheme announced bythe government has fallen woefully short of its expectation and of what is\nfair.\nIt does not go nearly far enough to try to remedy the injustice and hardship members of the Windrush generation have faced at the hands of Theresa May’s government.\nTo give a further specific example, a flat payment of £500 for people denied access to higher education is pitiful when research showed the value of higher education over a lifetime amounts to tens of thousands of\npounds.\nMoving forward, if we are to really learn the lessons of Windrush, and to make sure the scandal isn’t repeated, this means honestly assessing how false rhetoric on protecting our borders and immigration led directly to it.\nThe reality is that this scandal did not fall from the sky. It was a product of government policy.\nAnd In terms of government policy, it’s important to remember that the whole Tory party and the Lib Dems voted for the 2014 Immigration Act and implemented their ‘hostile environment’. As part of this, we had Theresa May as Home Secretary with her ‘Go Home’ vans and announcing that she would ‘deport first, appeal later’.\nAs Home Secretary, the current Prime Minister prided herself on developing policies that have resulted in British citizens who arrived as part of the Windrush generation losing their homes, jobs and livelihoods.\nAn important factor that needs to be recognised when talking about Windrush is that official policy, ministerial rhetoric and media coverage consistently fails to treat migrants as people.\nDespite various relaunches in both Amber Rudd and Sajid Javid’s tenures as Home Secretary, this fundamental element has not changed.\nThis government has been disgracefully slow to do the right thing by the Windrush generation. Now it won’t compensate people who were refused re-entry to this country. Now, they are still failing to address this scandal, which will continue until they end the hostile environment.\nLabour is clear. We will not rest until there is justice for the Windrush generation and we will end the failed ‘hostile environment’ approach for good. As part of this, we have committed to scrapping of the Immigration Act of 2014, which enshrined Theresa May’s ‘hostile environment’ into law.\nFurthermore, Labour has not only exposed these cruel policies of the Windrush scandal but has also outlined the steps that a Labour government will take to end these outrages and outlined what a fair immigration policy will look like in the future.\nLike on so many issues the Tories are failing on, the Tories have shown they simply can’t deliver when it comes to truth and justice for the victims of the Windrush scandal.\nIt’s time for the Tories to step aside and let Labour deliver a new, fairer approach.\nArticle printed in the Morning Star online\n· You can follow Diane at www.facebook.com/dianeabbott and www.twitter.com/hackneyabbott\nback ⇢",

How can the Minister continue to insist that a UK-replenished Saudi arsenal being dropped on Yemen is not an impediment to development?\"\nDiane also asked the Minister for International Development Justine Greening about whether the Government would be accepting into Britain child refugees who are currently in camps in Europe.\nYou can see a video of the debate here.\nKey services and jobs in Hackney could be under threat\nDiane Abbott MP has urged the Government to rethink new Home Office policy which would mean non-EU migrants having to earn more than £35,000 to stay in the country. Overseas workers who have lived in the UK for five years that fail to prove being paid this minimum threshold will face deportation.\nSpeaking to the Hackney Gazette, Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington said “This proposal is ill-considered, destructive and discriminatory. The figure is completely unrealistic – £35,000 is far higher than the average UK wage... It has the potential to rip the heart from communities like Hackney and cripple vital services – impacting countless health, charity, education and police workers, for a start.”\nRead the full story here\nThe Government must do more on the refugee crisis\nFollowing her recent trip to the refugee camp in Calais, Diane Abbott MP spoke to the Hackney Gazette about her visit, explaining that “there are thousands of people, including babies and very young children, living in freezing conditions with no education, limited food and healthcare.”\nShe added that “The government’s response to the crisis has been piecemeal, ineffectual and slow and it’s seen thousands stuck in a dehumanising limbo for far too long. This is a European crisis, and efforts to ease it need to reflect that – we need improved co-ordination between countries, and Britain needs to play its part,” and concluded that “This crisis is camped right on our doorstep and we have a clear moral obligation to work towards an effective, compassionate and sustainable solution.”\nRead the full piece here.\nUniversal Credit leaves working families worse off, IFS says\nThe introduction of Universal Credit (UC) will leave working families worse off on average, a Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week.\nUC, which combines six benefits into one monthly payment including Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), was intended to be more generous than the current system but the IFS said cuts to the programme meant this would not be the case.\nOwen Smith MP, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, responding to the new analysis by IFS on Universal Credit said: \"As was the case with Tax Credits, from this April low and middle paid working families will start losing as a result of these cuts - a single parent in full time work will be £3,000 a year worse off. So the Tories must use next month’s Budget to change course and listen to Labour’s demand to stop cuts to Universal Credit that will take an average of £1,600 from working families and risk causing a financial disaster for millions.”\nLabour holds George Osborne to account on the Google Tax Deal\nThis week, Labour has continued to question and scrutinise the Government on the recent Google tax deal. Writing to George Osborne, John McDonnell MP said “It has now been over a week since you announced on Twitter the Government’s tax deal with Google. Since then there has been public outcry and support from all side of the House of Commons at the decision to settle for such a derisory sum,” adding that “In fact, not one single fellow member of the Cabinet agrees with you that this was a “major success” And only yesterday on the Andrew Marr Show the Business Secretary has conceded on your behalf that this was “not a glorious moment”.\nYou can read the full letter here\nback ⇢",

We have had the denial of a full inquiry into Orgreave despite clear signals to the contrary from Theresa May and her team when she was home secretary, as well as the U-turn on her personal pledges on the third runway at Heathrow.\nThis is something of a pattern. It was initially denied that there had been any agreement or sweetheart deal for Nissan but now other car makers and other key industrial sectors are clamouring for special treatment. Unfortunately, the entire Brexit project is riddled with mendacity and it will not end well if we continue to give the government too much benefit of the doubt.\nMany of the lies and deceptions that have festered in British society for so long may not survive in the light of the coming negotiations.”\n- Read the full piece here\nJohn Healey MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Housing responded this week to new official statistics showing that fewer affordable homes are being built than at any time in more than two decades, saying: “These figures are disastrous. They show we are now building the lowest number of social rented homes since records began. And the number of affordable homes to buy has fallen by two-thirds since 2010.\n\"Public concern about housing is at the highest level for 40 years. Millions of families are struggling with high housing costs. Faced with this Ministers have turned their back on the way they can help most - by building low-cost homes to rent and buy.”\nThe NHS is supposed to be free at the point of need, not free at the point of ID\nJonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Health, commenting on reports this week that patients could be forced to bring two forms of identification to hospital to prove they are eligible for free treatment, said: “It’s testament to the desperate squeeze on our NHS finances that we have civil servants publicly talking about patients being forced to show not one but two forms of identification before they are treated. The NHS is supposed to be free at the point of need, not free at the point of ID.\n\"Day by day, further details are coming out of plans drawn up in secret all over the country to slash services and withdraw treatments... So rather than hiding behind this spun story, Jeremy Hunt needs to come clean, give the NHS the money it needs and rule out what many fear is a secret Tory strategy to cut services.”\nLabour announce £155 per week for WASPI women\nLabour has this week outlined our plans to help end the plight of the hundreds of thousands of women abandoned to live in poverty by the Tory Government’s changes to their state pension age.\nUnder the plan, Pension Credit will be extended to those who were due to retire before the chaotic pension age increase of the Conservative-led Coalition Government. This would alleviate the worst of the impacts for the most vulnerable women, and restore some of the dignity many of them feel they have been robbed of. It would provide support worth up to £155 per week to half a million of the most vulnerable WASPI women.\nThe Government’s changes have affected women who would normally have retired earlier under the 1995 Pensions Act. Labour plans to extend eligibility to pension credit to these women, ensuring that they are not forced into the Government’s punitive social security regime.\nLabour are also developing solutions for those affected who would not be entitled to means-tested Pension Credit under these proposals. It is however vital that action takes place now, to end the hardship faced by women who have worked all their lives, but find that they cannot retire as planned.\nSadly the Pensions Minister has issued a point blank refusal to do anything to alleviate the worse cases – claiming that the current social security system was sufficient to meet the needs of everyone. Labour are now acting where the government has refused.\nTories are turning back the clock on economic equality for women\nSarah Champion MP Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, commenting on research released this week by the Women’s Budget Group, showing that tax and benefit changes since 2010 will have hit women’s incomes twice as hard as men by 2020, said: “Last year the Government voted down Labour proposals to conduct a full cumulative impact assessment of their policies on women and since then the Treasury have refused to appear in front of the Women and Equalities Select Committee to give evidence on how the equalities impact analysis was conducted for the 2015 spending review.”\nLabour will not let the Tories off lightly with their warm words of equality and fairness when their policies systematically embed the very unfairness they say to want to tackle.\nInternational Students Are Welcome Here\nI have written a piece for The Morning Star on how the Tories’ hostile policies towards international students in our universities must be fought and how targeting international students, migrant doctors and forcing businesses to publish lists of foreign workers will create division, increase tensions and only make us poorer.\n- Read the full piece here\nback ⇢",

We expect our NHS workers to look after us. We even expect landlords to provide decent accommodation. But this government also expects them to act as border guards.”\nYou can read the full article here\nResponding to Paul Nuttall becoming UKIP leader\nOn Tuesday, the I Paper published an interview with myself where I argue that “I don’t think there’s any way forward for the Labour Party electorally from sounding Ukip-lite,” adding that “If you are attracted by Ukip arguments, you are going to vote Ukip. And in areas where they are not so upset about migration they are going to be baffled about what we are actually doing.” You can read the full interview here\nAdditionally, Labour released a video this week showing that Paul Nuttall, UKIP’s new leader, wants privatisation in the NHS and has argued that the “very existence of the NHS stifles competition”. You can watch and share a video exposing Paul Nuttall’s views on the NHS here\nU-turn as Government announces it will reverse 500 per cent increase in immigration & asylum tribunal fees\nThe Government announced this week that it will reverse its recent 500 per cent increase in immigration and asylum tribunal fees. In response, Richard Burgon MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: “This is a significant climb down by a Conservative Government which has done so much to deny access to justice to thousands of people, particularly those on lower incomes,” adding that “Labour opposed these measures in parliament when they came in just two months ago, and we are pleased the Justice Secretary has finally given in to all those who argued against these unfair fee increases.”\nAnalyses confirm Labour’s critique of the Autumn Statement as research confirms women are faring just as poorly under Hammond as they did under Osborne\nFollowing last week’s Autumn Statement, analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) confirmed that real wages would remain below their 2008 levels until at least 2021.\nAs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP put it, “This lost decade for living standards is unprecedented in modern British history and is a damning indictment of the total, abject failure of the Tories’ economic policy during their six wasted years in office.”\nAdditionally, research commissioned by Sarah Champion MP, Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, shows that women are faring just as poorly under Philip Hammond’s Autumn Statement as they did under George Osborne’s budget. As of the Autumn Statement, 86% of savings to the Treasury through tax and benefit changes since 2010 will have come from women. This is an increase in the burden on women from the last Autumn Statement when the figure was 81%.\nThe Conservative government have repeatedly refused to gender audit their own economic policies and announcements despite formal requests from the cross-party Women and Equalities Select Committee. As Sarah Champion said “Their silence on how their cuts affect women, and their refusal to gender audit their own policies, speak volumes. “\nThe Housing Crisis is Getting Worse and the Tories have no answer\nOfficial housebuilding figures this week have confirmed that the government are set to miss even their own inadequate housebuilding target by a big margin.\nIncredibly, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility analysed that the Autumn Statement will actually reduce the number of new homes being built over the next five years, meaning that 13,000 fewer affordable homes will be built by housing associations.\nAs Shadow Housing Minister Jon Healey said, “After we learnt last week that new affordable house building has fallen to its lowest level in 24 years, Ministers must now urgently sort out this mess and get Britain building again after six years of failure.”\nWith an unprecedented squeeze on NHS finances and now even fewer staff, it is clear that the Tories are failing our health service and its patients\nWith regards to the Autumn Statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) reported that NHS staffing growth will slow with the NHS set to have fewer staff this year than previously forecast.\nAs Jonathan Ashworth, Shadow Health Minister, said “The Chancellor failed to provide a single penny of extra investment for social care and the NHS,” and “with an unprecedented squeeze on NHS finances and now even fewer staff, it is clear that the Tories are failing our health service and its patients.”\nIn Hackney, and in over 500 other places Labour members took to the street this weekend to #CareforOurNHS - you can sign up for Labour’s campaign and get information here\nback ⇢",

Millions are facing the misery of poverty wages, a housing crisis and insecure work and the Tories bungling of Brexit is adding to a worsening economic outlook and feeling of insecurity about the future.With this overall context in mind, it was with great sadness that I heard this week that nine of my Labour MP colleagues had resigned from the party.\nAs Jeremy Corbyn said in response to the news, “Our opponents are the Tories, not each other, and it's disappointing that a small group of MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945.“\nWhilst this is much more work to do to win a Labour government, it’s important in light of this week’s developments to restate that at the 2017 General Election, Labour won people over on a programme for the many not the few of ending Tory austerity. We confounded the pundits and bucked the trend of declining votes for left-of-centre parties across Europe.\nThe basis of this step forward was a clear commitment in our manifesto to not only ending austerity, but also genuinely redistributing wealth and power, taking vital resources into public ownership, investing in every region and nation, and tackling climate change through a green jobs revolution.\nWhen millions are facing the misery of Universal Credit, rising crime, homelessness and poverty, now more than ever is the time to bring people together to build a better future for us all and make this progressive alternative a reality.\nIn the constituency I represent, Hackney North and Stoke Newington, I hear every day from constituents who are struggling to make ends meet, who are victims of the housing crisis or can’t find social care for themselves or relatives.\nAnd this situation isn’t going to get any better unless the Tories go. In fact, despite their spin to the contrary, their failed, ideologically-driven, austerity cuts are not coming to an end, but in fact being deepened.\nFor those millions the only solution is a Labour Government that will invest in and transform our country.\nI am old enough to remember the last big split in the Labour party – it led to the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981.\nThe new party was launched with an even bigger fanfare than the current group, it had almost universal approval from the media and it made amazing strides very quickly. Twenty eight Labour MPs defected to the SDP. Unfortunately almost all of them incinerated their careers. And, for all of the sensation of its launch, the lasting achievement of the SDP was to split the Labour vote and help keep the Tories in power for 18 years.\nSo anyone would be sad contemplating this week’s split. The danger is that it puts the possibility of a Labour government further away than ever but so many ordinary people are desperate for a Labour government.\nWhen Labour members think of how to respond to these developments, we must remember that the public will not be interested in what they may well regard as a squabble inside the Westminster bubble. Instead, they want politicians who are engaged in the reality of ordinary people’s lives.\nIn terms of one of the key claims of those who have left Labour this week in this regard, it\nis untrue to say that Labour has been complicit in a Tory Brexit.\nThe truth is that it was Labour in Parliament that campaigned for a meaningful vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal. I voted Remain, I represent one of the strongest Remain constituencies in the country and if a second referendum were held tomorrow, I would vote Remain again.\nBut I think that critics of Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on Brexit don’t appreciate how he has struggled to keep the party together on this issue. Labour represents the some of the most pro-Remain constituencies in the country (including mine, Hackney North) but it also represents some of the most pro-Leave constituencies in the country.\nThe reality is that the Conservative Government is bungling Brexit, while Labour has set out a credible position to bring people together, just as our alternative economic strategy to end austerity can also bring together communities across the country.\nIn contrast to Labour, the Tories are the party that has brought us record levels of violent crime; a struggling National Health Service; damaging cuts in local government; benefit cuts; the Windrush scandal and much more besides, tearing apart the very fabric of our society.\nWith the awful example of what happened following the split of the SDP in the 80s in our minds, we must strive to keep the Labour party together and continue to build on – and win support for – our programme for the many, not the few.\nIt is radical Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn that will see through the progressive transformation our society and economy need. Let’s make it happen.\nhttps://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/now-more-ever-time-bring-people-together\nback ⇢",

For all the key political players this is the end game. There have also recently been a slew of job loss and closure announcements from major manufacturers like, Honda, Nissan and Ford make it clear that this is not “Project Fear”.This is a succession of real time events that we actually need to be frightened of.\nOutside of peace and war, discussions hardly get more serious than these. So it is extremely important that political leaders are honest in this debate. How else can the public make informed judgements? Sadly, the Prime Minister has got into the habit of telling half-truths and complete untruths about Brexit.\nShe has posed false choices ‘my deal or no deal’ She repeats the same half-truths “‘there are substantive discussion with the EU on the backstop”. And she has resorted to complete distortion on the crucial matter of the customs union.\nIn her recent letter to the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, the Prime Minister berated him for his consistent demand that for membership of a customs union. And it is worth mentioning that it is a demand which the support of both business and trade unions. The Prime Minister writes: “As I explained when we met, the Political Declaration explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union - no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors and no checks on rules of origin (paragraph 23)”.\nThis would be reassuring if it were true. The only trouble is, that this is a false and misleading assertion. The Prime Minister has misquoted the Political Declaration, and the misquotation helps her argument.\nHere is paragraph 23 of the Political Declaration in full: “The economic partnership should ensure no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors, with ambitious customs arrangements that, in line with the Parties' objectives and principles above, build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement which obviates the need for checks on rules of origin.”\nWhat the Prime Minister has done is to claim that the Political Declaration ‘provides for the benefits’ of a customs union - when it does nothing of the sort. It is clear when paragraph 23 is quoted in its entirety that it is a hope or wish that this is the case. ‘Should’ is the crucial word.\nIt is an aspiration, and not something that will necessarily follow at all. It is also accompanied (for example in paragraph 26) by all sorts of wishes based for ‘facilitative arrangements and technologies’ which have so far proved elusive if not illusory in relation to the backstop in Ireland.\nWords matter. They particularly matter in Treaties and Political Declarations. The Withdrawal Agreement, widely known as ‘May’s deal’ clearly sets out the objective of leaving both the customs union and the Single Market. Leaving them both are part of the Prime Minister’s many red lines.\nThe Prime Minister’s claims on the Political Declaration are false. They are an attempt to obscure the decisive difference between her deal and Jeremy Corbyn’s policy.\nJeremy Corbyn is demanding that our economy is in a customs union and the closest possible relationship with the Single Market. The Prime Minister is willing to destroy tens of thousands of jobs and lower living standards as workers at Nissan, Ford and Honda are finding out. And she is willing to distort the truth to do so.\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-deal-theresa-may-eu-vote-commons-customs-union-labour-corbyn-a8789861.html\nback ⇢",

At the very least the Government should bring forward £2 billion of emergency funding for social care and make clear as soon as possible how this money is going to be used to increase capacity and take some of the pressure off NHS hospitals, so that patients and their families never have to go through a winter like this again.\nWhilst reports of any additional money for social care are of course welcome, the reality is that it is the Tories who have spent the last 7 years cutting billions from council budgets. This has meant the loss of £5 billion for adult social care.\nAs well as putting £2 billion into the budget for social care, there is also an urgent need for a longer-term funding plan to get social care out of the current crisis and on to a more stable footing.\nTory failure on living standards see earnings fall by £1,100 a year, or £21 a week at the same time as exploitative zero hours contracts make it harder for families to make ends meet\nLabour analysis, using House of Common’s Library endorsed modelling, shows that average real earnings are set to fall by just under £1,100 a year, or £21 a week, as a result of rising inflation and lower wage growth.\nThe combination of higher prices and lower wages is that living standards are being squeezed.\nThis analysis comes on the back of IFS analysis last year which showed that the “outlook for living standards has deteriorated rather sharply”, between Budget 2016 and Autumn Statement 2016, describing the prospects for real earnings growth as “dreadful”.\nThe Resolution Foundation has also said that the “outlook for living standards in 21st century Britain does not look promising” and that “weak and regressive nature of income growth in the years ahead should\nconcern us all”.\nAn additional analysis from the Resolution Foundation has shown that nearly one million workers are now on zero hours contracts, confirming unprecedented levels of insecurity among working people.\nThe truth is that Theresa May has failed working people; with a lower National Living Wage than promised just 12 months ago and massive cuts to Universal Credit still in the pipeline. The next Labour government\nwill implement a real Living Wage, ban exploitative zero hours contracts and reverse pernicious cuts to working people.\nWe can build a radically fairer, more democratic, and more prosperous society - John McDonnell’s pre-budget speech\nThe aforementioned rising cost of living crisis and unacceptable squeeze in funding for our public services are both results of the Tories’ ideologically-driven austerity, which is a political choice not an economic necessity.\nAs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell put it in his pre-budget speech lastweek “instead of rising to the challenge I fear the approach from this government on the economy is to continue the failures of the past.”\nDespite some cosmetic changes, this remains a retrograde step from the Trump Presidency\nAs Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Emily Thornberry MP, said this week in response to the US administration’s updated travel ban, “Despite some cosmetic changes, this remains a retrograde step for the United States. By abdicating its responsibilities under international law, the administration continues to send a terrible message to the rest of the world on the refugee crisis. While it remains to be seen whether or not this new executive order will stand up in court, nothing changes the fact that these measures are unnecessary, divisive and wrong.”\nThe police continue to do their best even though the Conservatives are cutting our police force by millions of pounds — and thousands of officers\nLast week, saw the release of the HMIC’s PEEL: Police effectiveness 2016 report, which clearly shows that the police are doing their best despite this Tory Government’s actions.\nHer Majesty’s Inspectorate says that some forces are struggling to respond to shrinking resources. Some are artificially downgrading the severity of calls, others are not able to properly carry out their core functions of crime prevention, public security and apprehending criminals. Some are setting quotas for specialist police or failing to register organised gangs in their area, because that would require further action.\nWe should be clear, the primary responsibility for this is not individual forces or officers. The fault lies with the Tory government who have cut 20,000 police officers and who are now cutting police\nbudgets across the country.\nback ⇢",

It will take more than a speech and a slogan for Theresa May to convince people that she wants to tackle division in society. Whilst Teresa May made a speech in favour of a shared society on Monday, spiralling inequality and division remain in Britain.\nThe Tories should be judged on what they have done in government: over the last six years they have systematically failed to stand up for the majority. Under the Tories those at the top have been given tax breaks while everyone else suffers, working people have had vital support cut and our NHS is being run into the ground.\nWhilst Teresa May promised a new focus on mental health issues, as Andrew Gywnne MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister Without Portfolio, said: “Mental health is a case study in Tory failure. Repeatedly the Tories give speeches saying they will give mental health parity with physical health, but their record is dismal: spending on mental health fell by £600 million in the last parliament, money intended for children’s mental health goes to other priorities and there are thousands fewer mental health nurses than when the Tories came to power.”\nYou can watch Jeremy Corbyn take on Teresa May at #PMQs on the ‘shared society’ and the crisis in the NHS here\nThe Tory record on mental health is one of failure\nDespite Theresa May’s speech this week, the reality is that the Tories have been in Government for six years and during that time have failed to ensure that mental health is given the same priority as physical health.\nThe Government has failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health services, and people are being let down as a result.\nFunding for mental health fell by over 8 per cent over the last parliament, there are now 6,600 fewer mental health nurses compared to 2010 and thousands of patients in crisis have to travel out of area for a psychiatric bed. Additionally, much of the extra funding meant for children’s mental health services has actually been used for other NHS services.\nAs Barbara Keeley MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Mental Heath said: “This Tory Government’s record on mental health is one of failure,” and whilst “They might talk about equality between mental and physical health, but we are yet to see their rhetoric become reality.”\nThe Tories Must Take Responsibility for the crisis in the NHS\nThe crisis in our NHS is unprecedented with people lying on trolleys in corridors waiting to be seen and hospitals having to close their doors, unable to admit patients.\nThis winter we are seeing a third of hospitals reporting they need urgent help to cope with the numbers of patients coming through the doors, A&Es have had to turn patients away more than 140 times in December because they couldn’t cope and several hospitals have admitted they couldn’t offer patients comprehensive care.\nAstonishingly, the Red Cross has announced it is providing humanitarian assistance to NHS trusts that simply do not have the resources to cope. As Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said: “The Red Cross being called in to help in our hospitals is just the latest staggering example of how the NHS is now being pushed to breaking point. For the Red Cross to brand the situation a ‘humanitarian crisis’ should be a badge of shame for government ministers. “\nThen this week Jeremy Hunt suggested that the four hour A&E target no longer apply to minor illnesses.\nThe fact is this government have repeatedly failed to put the necessary resources into our health service, while they have cut social care and wasted billions on a top-down reorganization to accelerate privatization.\nAs Jeremy Corbyn put it “ The health service is at breaking point. But this crisis is not due to an outbreak of disease. It is a crisis made in Downing Street by this government – a crisis we warned them about.”\nThe Conservatives failed to find a single penny for the NHS in their autumn statement. Now, Labour is demanding that Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt have to take both responsibility and urgent action to tackle it.\nAn important ruling from the European Court protecting our rights\nYou may have missed the news over the seasonal break that key aspects of UK legislation relating to the powers of the state over citizens have been struck down by the European Court. This government and its predecessor have been deemed to be over-reaching in relation to those powers, infringing the rights of all citizens.\nYou can read my piece on how this legislation relating to the powers of the state over citizens have been struck down by the European Court and we will seek to work with the Government for a major legislative rethink here.\nback ⇢",
  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_articles_item1712/content_75.html": "The Fight for Abortion Rights\nThe country was outraged recently at the draconian decision to imprison a woman for two years for the unlawful termination of her pregnancy. This decision, which will see a mother of three jailed under a Victorian-era law, highlights an uncomfortable fact that in the UK civil rights protections are far more vulnerable than we might imagine.\nThis decision came nearly a full year after the US Republicans completed their decades long campaign to overturn the US Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling, Roe vs Wade. This landmark ruling granted the federal right to women’s reproductive healthcare, including abortion. Women's healthcare in the US was plunged into chaos, as 13 Republican dominated states activated ‘trigger laws’ which came into effect the moment Roe vs Wade was overturned. Today, US abortion law is a complex minefield for women trying to exercise their right to choose, with many forced to clandestinely travel out of state, often for life saving healthcare. Perhaps most heartbreaking was the story of a 10-year-old girl, forced to travel out of state to abort a pregnancy arising from rape.\nIn comparison to the US, the situation in the UK on abortion rights has appeared far more progressive. Scratch beneath the surface however, and we find that the law protecting the right to abortion in the UK is shaky at best. This week's decision to imprison a mother of three for a late abortion highlights the pressing need to strengthen abortion rights and banish Victorian-era anti-choice legislation once and for all. Any apathy or complacency from progressives about the legal footing of issues of reproductive rights in the UK must come to an end. We urgently need fresh legislation to fully decriminalise abortion; and we need only look to the US to see what awaits us if we do not.\nWe must also ask why this woman was even charged with a crime in the first place! The code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles that should be followed when deciding whether to prosecute a criminal offence. One of the key questions that must be answered by a prosecutor before charging someone is “Is it in the public interest for the CPS to bring the case to court?”. Clearly, it is not in the public interest for the CPS to have even brought charges in the first place. The law cited was archaic (The 1861 Offences against the Person Act) and there is no legitimate “public interest” that should empower prosecutors to pry into any woman’s right to access reproductive healthcare.\nFinally, progressives and feminists should consider that the jury in this case chose to convict this woman, rather than acquit her. We must learn from this is that the public case for abortion rights needs to be restated. We should not assume that the issue of abortion rights is settled, and that the situation cannot get worse. The UK does have a small but significant zealous anti-abortion lobby. On this, we can take inspiration from the incredible campaign run by Irish feminists to “repeal the 8th amendment” who obtained a huge mandate for the right to abortion in a 2018 referendum, with over 66% of voters supporting the campaign. This achievement was even more historic considering that as late as 2002, Irish voters rejected by referendum the right to an abortion, even in cases of a threat to the life of a woman.\nThe fight for reproductive healthcare is far from over. But by discarding complacency and taking inspiration from feminists all over the world, past and present, we can ensure no woman is ever jailed for trying to access healthcare again.\nback ⇢",

We will recruit thousands of real police officers to the frontline. For all their big talk about recruiting more police officers, the Tories seem to be relying on taking people out of police administration and putting them in a uniform.”\nI added that, “Unlike this government, we aren’t encouraging more school exclusions. Children should be in school, otherwise they will be schooled by gangs. We will tackle mental health care underfunding and inequalities. We will build new homes and outlaw zero hours contracts. We will tackle the causes of crime,” and that “when I travel up and down the country talking to people about their concerns about crime and public order, they often mention the cuts to the Youth Service. Labour is listening. Soon we will soon be announcing details of an entirely new Youth Service to address the issues of: educational exclusion; a lack of role models: inequality and deprivation among our young people. My brilliant colleague the Shadow Minister Cat Smith will be leading on this.”\nI also attacked the Tories’ election approach, arguing that “They think that can win votes with dog-whistle racism. Led by a man who described veiled Muslim women, as looking like letter boxes or bank robbers. And Boris Johnson has still not got round to apologising.” In contrast to the Tories, Labour will always stand for unity, not division.\nYou can read my full speech at https://labour.org.uk/press/diane-abbott-speech-labour-party-conference-2019\nLabour will scrap Universal Credit\nJeremy Corbyn announced this week that Labour will scrap Universal Credit, calling the flagship Tory welfare reform “inhumane” and an “unmitigated disaster”.\nSpeaking at a rally in Chingford and Woodford Green, the seat currently held by Iain Duncan Smith MP – the architect of Universal Credit – Jeremy set out Labour’s plans to replace Universal Credit with a social security system that focuses on “alleviating and ending poverty, not driving people into it”.\nIn government, Labour will immediately end the worst aspects of Universal Credit, including:\n- Ending the benefit cap and the two child limit, which alone will stop up to 300,000 children being pushed into poverty;\nImmediately suspending the punitive sanctions regime, which has been ineffective at supporting people back to work and has instead pushed people into poverty and reliance on foodbanks;\n- Ending Universal Credit’s “digital only” requirement, which excludes people who cannot access the internet or are not computer literate, and recruiting 5000 additional advisors to deliver this change;\n- Switching to split payments and fortnightly payments, including an automatic interim payment to end the five week wait.\nAs well as scrapping Universal Credit, Labour will replace the Department for Work and Pensions with a Department for Social Security, marking a radical shift from a system that “punishes and polices” people to one where social security will support people in finding work and treat them with “dignity and respect”.\nBoris Johnson’s language was nothing short of disgraceful\nJeremy Corbyn spoke in Parliament this week in response to the urgent question raised by Jess Phillips MP on the Prime Minister’s use of language, following Boris Johnson’s behaviour in the House on Wednesday.\nJeremy correctly said that “The Prime Minister’s language and demeanour yesterday was nothing short of disgraceful,” and that the “language that politicians use matters – it has real consequences.”\n“No one is above the law” – the Supreme Court’s decision\nCommenting on the Supreme Court’s decision last week that the proroguing of parliament was “unlawful, void and of no effect”, Shami Chakrabarti, Labour’s Shadow Attorney General said that “No one is above the law. Not even Boris Johnson and his arrogant, entitled chums are above the law. They have been getting away with things all their lives, but today they have been called to account.”\nBoris Johnson should be ashamed of himself. He needs to reflect on this judgement and consider his position.\nDevastating impact No Deal Brexit could have on the NHS\nA report from the National Audit Office has highlighted the risks if the UK leaves the EU with no deal with regards to the impact on the health and social care sector.\nAs Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said “Here we have another body warning of the devastating impact a no deal Brexit could have on the NHS.”\nFrom the supply of medicines and patient access to care, to the impact on the health workforce: no part of the health service will be left untouched.\nIt is scandalous that by stubbornly refusing to rule out No Deal, Boris Johnson is putting patients’ health and lives at risk.\nLabour will scrap prescription charges\nIt was announced at Labour Conference that the next Labour government will abolish prescription charges in England as part of the party’s plans to expand universalism in public services.\nCurrently, prescriptions are free for patients living in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – but cost £9.00 per item in England. This is a particular burden on people with long term conditions like asthma and chronic kidney disease who can fork out up to £104 a year on medication, or even if more if they do not opt in to the NHS pre-payment discount scheme.\nResearch has shown that prescription charges put people off from collecting prescribed medicine. A survey of health professionals by the Royal College of Nursing found that 87% said they have had their patients skip their medication because of the cost of their prescription. Asthma UK also found that over three quarters of people with asthma in England struggle to afford their prescriptions and over half had cut back on their medication because of the price. One in three sufferers with rheumatoid arthritis have not collected a prescription due to the cost: women are three times more likely than men to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.\nLabour will put public health before private profit – Jeremy Corbyn’s speech at Labour Conference\nJeremy Corbyn used his speech at Labour Conference to announce Labour’s plans to put “public health before private profit” by ensuring that pharmaceutical companies make vital drugs available at prices that the National Health Service can afford.\nJeremy raised the case of Luis Walker, a nine-year-old boy he met on Monday who is living with cystic fibrosis and is being denied the medicine he needs – Orkambi – because its manufacturer refuses to sell the drug to the NHS for an affordable price.\nHe criticised the pharmaceutical industry and drug companies for putting “profits for shareholders before people’s lives” in the case of Luis and thousands of others suffering from illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C and breast cancer.\nHe then launched ‘Medicines for the Many’, a radical programme of reforms to make life-changing drugs available at affordable prices and create a health innovation system that will put public health before private profit.\nPromising to take on the big pharmaceutical companies which deny life-saving and life-changing medicines to ill patients by charging extortionate prices, he announced plans to secure generic versions of patented medicines at a price that is affordable for the NHS, make public funding for research conditional on the result drugs being priced affordably for all and create a new, publicly-owned generic drugs manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to our NHS.\nYou can read Jeremy’s full speech at https://labour.org.uk/press/jeremy-corbyns-labour-party-conference-leaders-address/\nLabour’s Bold Vision to Tackle the Climate Emergency\nRebecca Long-Bailey was right to use her Conference speech to warn that “The far-right are ready to capitalise on climate change, the threat of resource scarcity and economic despair. And they will mobilise if we allow the cost of taking action to fall on the shoulders of the poor, workers and consumers to reinforce their messages of nationalism and exclusion.”\nBut, as Rebcecca also pointed out, millions of people across the world took to the streets just prior to Labour Conference demanding climate justice, because they know that politicians need to wake up, act faster and provide social justice if we are to save the planet.\nAnd Labour agrees. We stand for government intervention to rapidly decarbonise our economy and push aside decades of neoliberal policy to create the industries of the future. Quality, unionised, green jobs, a proper industrial strategy, public ownership of our water and energy, and intervention in the economy, to make sure that the technologies of the future are manufactured, assembled and installed here.\nYou can read Rebecca’s full speech at https://labour.org.uk/press/rebecca-long-bailey-speaking-labour-party-conference/\nLabour stands for a shorter working week and expanded free public services as part of a new society\nOutlining Labour’s commitment to “transforming lives, increasing fulfilment”, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has committed Labour to reducing the average working week to 32 hours within a decade and eliminating in-work poverty in the first term of a Labour government.\nAlongside Labour’s pledge on free personal care, a shorter working week forms part of a radical set of policies that will enable people to live rich, fulfilling lives with the time and resources to spend in a clean, safe and pleasant environment.\nPromising to “lay the foundations of a new society”, John McDonnell pledged a three-pronged approach to transforming the economy: expanding free universal public services, driving up wages and driving down living costs, and strengthening the social security system.\nLabour is committed to reducing the working week by setting up an independent Working Time Commission, based on the Low Pay Commission, to recommend increases in minimum holiday entitlements, and rolling out collective bargaining to enable trade unions and employers to negotiate how to meet the target in each sector.\nAs John said, “It’s not just about a fulfilling life at work, we should work to live, not live to work.”\nYou can read John’s full speech at https://labour.org.uk/press/john-mcdonnell-speaking-labour-party-conference/\nReckless Tory cuts have consequences\nYou can read my latest column on why now is the time to stop cuts to our fire and rescue services at https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/reckless-tory-cuts-have-consequences\nback ⇢",

  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_parliamentary-report_item1706/content_72.html": "NEWS THIS WEEK - from Diane Abbott MP\nAusterity - Liberal Democrats and David Cameron have learnt nothing\nAs John McDonnell MP, said this week, the Liberal Democrats’ “well being budget” shows that “the Lib Dems have a staggering cheek. Apart from stealing the well being idea from Labour, they were part of the government that created every austerity measure, cutting benefits and our public services and causing large scale poverty and human suffering in our communities.”\nPeople haven’t forgotten the pain they inflicted on us and the lies they told last time they were in government, and neither have they forgotten about David Cameron’s record, saying he should have “ripped the plaster off” earlier in his premiership and introduced steeper cuts in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\nAstonishingly this week David Cameron claimed that austerity should have gone further.\nAs John also said, “Cameron clearly has no idea of the scale of human suffering his austerity cuts inflicted on our communities. This confirms how cut off this privileged class of Tories are from the everyday lives of our people.”\nInternational students treated abominably by the Tories\nA report from the Public Accounts Committee has said that the Home Office “rushed to penalise” international students accused of cheating in the English language test scandal without checking the reliability of the evidence. It also says that revoking visas before verifying evidence led to “injustice and hardship for many thousands of international students”.\nAs I have said before, these international students have been treated abominably. Some used their whole families’ savings to pay to study here, and were then deported on faulty evidence.\nLabour welcomes international students here and the contribution they make. They are owed an apology by this government. Until the Tories’ whole ‘hostile environment’ is ended, similar scandals will recur.\nBoris Johnson must apologise for shameful comments about child abuse\nI issued a Press Release in my capacity as Shadow Home Secretary this week in response to Boris Johnson denying comments he made regarding investigations into historic child abuse cases, in which I said “Boris Johnson’s original comments were so shameful and hurtful to the victims of historic child abuse that it is no wonder he now wants to deny he ever said them.”\n“The Prime Minister must apologise, sincerely and profusely, for the harm his disgusting comments caused, and now for lying to the people about it.”\nAs has been widely reported, in March this year, Boris Johnson said “£60m I saw was being spaffed up the wall on some investigation into historic child abuse.” Yet this week, Boris Johnson denied saying it.\nPriti Patel’s suggestion that we could maintain access to all our security arrangements if we crash out of the EU is simply not plausible\nHome Secretary Priti Patel claimed on Marr last week the UK could stay part of all international security agreements in the event of a no deal Brexit.\nThe Home Secretary seems deeply confused about the UK’s security arrangements in the event of a no deal, and needs to clarify the situation urgently.\nThe reality is that her suggestion that we could maintain access to all our security arrangements if we crash out of the EU is simply not plausible.\nBoris Johnson is happy for us to stop cooperating fully with our neighbours on security. Not only will we lose access to real-time information about security threats if we crash out of the EU, but we may also have to destroy some of the data we already have.\nThis is why Labour has led efforts to get No Deal off the table. This government would knowingly compromise the safety of its citizens – it has no business running our country.\n‘String of high-profile failures’ in outsourcing – Labour will end this racket\nAn Institute for Government report this week analysed ‘a string of high-profile failures’ in outsourcing. The ‘string of high-profile failures’ discussed in this report are not just one-offs – they reflect a broken model for delivering public services, which prioritises profit over people.\nThe report notes that “a string of high-profile failures has put Britain’s outsourcing model under intense scrutiny.” It says that, despite claims that outsourcing achieves 20%-30% in cost savings, “we found little evidence that such savings are available today, whether for services outsourced for the first time or on second- or third-generation contracts.”\nIt’s becoming clearer by the day that we’re at a crossroads on outsourcing, as the Institute for Government says, and it’s staggering to look back at the last 40 years of this failed experiment and see so little strong evidence that it works.\nOnly Labour will end this racket and make sure our public services are run in the interests of the many, not to enrich a privileged few.\n3/4 of UK universities are very or extremely concerned about the impact of No Deal\nA Universities UK report this week showed that three quarters of surveyed UK universities are ‘very’ or ‘extremely concerned’ about the negative impact a No Deal.\nAs Angela Rayner MP, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said “Boris Johnson’s reckless No Deal Brexit would be disastrous for our universities.”\nNearly one in five university academics are EU nationals and they all face uncertainty and anxiety about their future. A chaotic and damaging No Deal Brexit will also have a devastating impact on the ability of our universities to recruit students from EU countries and access research funding.\nYet the new Education Secretary has been unable to give universities even the most basic reassurance that he has any credible plan.\nThat is why Labour will continue to take all necessary steps to stop Boris Johnson forcing us into a No Deal Brexit that no one voted for.\nGovernment’s Prevent review far from independent\nThe government has now published its terms of reference for its review into Prevent.\nThe reality is that this review will also be far from independent, as it relies on Home Office support, while the reviewer has previously stated his strong support for Prevent.\nAs I said in my Press Release on the matter, “This is a strange review. You cannot possibly analyse something without looking at the evidence of how it has operated in the past. And the fact that this crucial information being ignored tells us the government already accepts Prevent has been an abject failure.”\nback ⇢",

They are right to do so – as I argued on Question Time last Thursday, Theresa May must be willing to tell President Trump that he is wrong - her failure to do so is shameful.\nWe simply cannot turn a blind eye to Donald Trump’s values. This is a man who even compared to other right-wing Republican Presidents is quite extraordinary.\nAs Jeremy Corbyn has said “Let no one be in doubt that I will oppose, and the Labour Party will oppose, all those who fan the flames of fear at home and abroad… His invite should be withdrawn until the executive orders are gone and every element of them repealed.”\nLabour has taken a clear lead on this issue, with Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry saying after the Prime Minister met Trump last week that, “The Prime Minister referred to a special relationship based on our shared history and interests, but she has to realise that it is also a relationship based on shared values, and if the President is going to discard those values, whether by embracing torture or ignoring climate change, then she must be willing to tell him frankly that he is wrong. Her failure to do so today - even behind closed doors - was nothing less than shameful.”\nTheresa May continues to deny the NHS Crisis\nThis week we saw reports of increases in waiting times for hip operations as the crisis in the NHS deepens.\nIt is shocking in 21st Century Britain that patients in some parts of the country will only qualify for knee and hip replacement operations on the NHS if they can prove pain so exceptional that it prevents sleep.\nRationing of this kind is against the best traditions of the NHS and now there are concerns that if the Government continues to deny sufficient funding to the NHS, rationing of treatments could become more widespread.\nIn the same week, we saw other reports that GPs are drawing up plans to charge patients for evening and weekend appointments.\nThis would allow wealthier patients to jump the queue. It is an intolerable consequence of Government under-funding of General Practice and the Tories’ wasteful re-organisation of the NHS.\nAs Shadow Secretary of State for Health Jonathan Ashworth said, “The fairest, most efficient and most equitable way of delivering healthcare is to ensure it is publicly funded and free at the point of use.”\nDay-after-day we see further revelations about the reality of Tory mismanagement of the NHS. The Prime Minister simply cannot keep blaming everyone other than her own Government for the scale of this crisis.\nThe latest crime statistics show the true scale of the challenge our police officers now face due to Tory cuts\nThe release of police workforce statistics, this week showed that with over 20,000 officers lost since 2010, the Tories are risking public safety with these extreme cuts.\nAs I said in a Press Release issued as Shadow Home Secretary, “They slashed police budgets in the last Parliament and are reducing funding even further now… The latest crime statistics show the true scale of the challenge our officers now face. This is the worst time to cut the police.”\nTory Government Blames Migrants For Its Own Failings\nWhen the Tories attack migrants to distract from their own failings the overwhelming majority of the population is worse off twice over. First, it means they are getting away with cuts, rising inequality and falling living standards. They are also getting away with attacking our communities and those we all rely on.\nThere is a widespread anxiety that the economic outlook will deteriorate. If so, we should expect the Tories to expand their scapegoating tactics. Labour will pin the blame where it really belongs.

He claims Labour's change would kill an agreement with the US. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott explains why she's standing firm - saying Tories are putting us at risk, and smears won’t change that.The security Minister Ben Wallace used one of the Sunday newspapers to accuse me and Jeremy Corbyn personally, saying we were wrecking a government bill that would help combat paedophiles who operate internationally, or who flee justice in this country.\nThis is an outrageous claim, both muddle-headed and nasty. It is a Labour amendment to the government’s Bill. I am happy to stand by it because it protects human rights and the rule of law.\nOur amendment would prevent authorities in this country sharing data with overseas agencies where there is a risk of the imposition of the death penalty. More than 50 years ago parliament as a whole passed a law which ‘opposes the death penalty in all circumstances’.\nThat is the law of the land. It means we do not co-operate with any government if the consequence could be capital punishment. Parliament has for a long time believed that the death penalty is so abhorrent, and the risks of a miscarriage of justice so awful, that we outlaw it. Our ban applies to all countries where the death penalty is still on the statute books.\nBut government Ministers are desperate to cosy up to Donald Trump’s administration in the US, where the death penalty is still imposed. Our amendment simply blocks data sharing co-operation with all countries if the death penalty is a risk.\nThe reason Ministers seem to be so keen to tear up our laws and ignore our human rights is because they are in a terrible mess in refusing to rule out a No Deal Brexit. Among other things this will end all our very close co-operation with all the EU countries in the areas of security and justice. Under Tory plans, we will actually be severing the agreement which allow us to co-ordinate with the EU on combating terrorism, organised crime, people traffickers, and fugitives from justice, including paedophiles.\nThere is almost nothing this government is doing that is not associated with Brexit, and its madcap refusal to rule out crashing out with No Deal. And because this is such a major threat to all of us Tory Ministers are resorting to ever more outrageous claims and smears to justify their actions.\nIt is this government which is putting our security at risk. And it is resorting to the lowest form of insults to cover up for that fact.\nback ⇢",

Then come back and show us how it is done.\" has appalled people around the world. Trump is a Republican, but even many of his own party colleagues have condemned his remarks. The British Conservative Party is the Republicans sister party. But Britain’s own Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has been forced to reflect publicly on the number of times he has been told to go home: “I’m from an immigrant family, I know what it’s like to be told to go back to where I came from\".\nAnd\nthe whole horrible episode has climaxed with a huge crowd at a Trump rally\nchanting “Send her back! Send her back!” in reference to congresswoman Ilhan\nOmar.\nThe\nfirst thing to reflect on is how far downhill American rhetoric on race has\ndescended under the impact of Trump’s white nationalism. In the 2008 American\npresidential election, which was obviously very racially charged, there was a\nbig Republican rally where a supporter told the Republican presidential\ncandidate John McCain that she was “scared” of an Obama presidency. McCain\nreplied promptly “I have to tell you that Obama is a decent person and a person\nyou do not have to be scared of as President of the United States”. Even more\nstrikingly at the same rally in response to another supporter who said she\ncouldn’t trust Obama because he was an Arab, McCain shook his head firmly and\nsaid “No ma’am. He is a decent family man and a citizen who I just happen to have\nstrong disagreements with on fundamental issues”.\nIt is a world away from a\nRepublican presidential candidate firmly pushing back on his own supporters\nracism to the current Republican President deliberately whipping up that very\nracism.\nBut\nwe should not look at these recent events as evidence of some special Trump\nbarbarism. Since her election to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 2013,\nCecile Kyenge an Italian of African descent, constantly faced racist abuse.\nWhen she became Italy’s minister for integration, as the country’s first black\nminister, it got worse. A fellow Italian MEP, Mario Borghezio, called her\nappointment “a shitty choice” by a “bongo-bongo” government. A former\nvice-president of the Italian Senate, Roberto Calderoli, said in a public\nmeeting: “When I see pictures of Kyenge I can’t help but think of the features\nof an orangutan.” There seems to be something about a strong black woman in\npolitics that racists find triggering. I had some experience of this in the\n2017 election. Even the Conservative party, itself by singling me out in\nposters, Facebook advertisements and speeches made me wonder what dog whistle\npolitics they were actually playing.\nSo\nTrump’s white nationalist politics are not an aberration. His top supporter and\nadvisor, Steve Bannon, is advising a number of right-wing European parties\nincluding the French Front National and the soon to be British Prime Minister\nBoris Johnson. The fear must be that, here in Britain, images of Trump\nsupporters chanting “Send her home” will give renewed legitimacy to all the\nPowellite and National Front rhetoric of the nineteen seventies about repatriation.\nThe American writer Adam Serwer has said: “The president’s belief is that\nAmerican citizenship is conditional for people of colour, who should be\ngrateful we are even allowed to be here.” This is a view that will resonate\nwith many on the right of politics in this country. The same American writer\nalso said “If multiracial democracy cannot be defended in America, it will\nnot be defended elsewhere.” This is what is so alarming about Trump’s chanting\nsupporters. And it is a call to arms for progressives here in Britain.\nWe\nmust resist white nationalism even when it is dressed up as a phoney workerism.\nThere were a number of perfectly intellectually defensible, Tony Benn era,\narguments for coming out of the EU. But underlying some Leave sentiment was a\nLittle Englander nationalism, which should be rejected. Trump shows us that it\nis only a short step from a country happy to elect their first black president,\nto crowds baying to send an American Congresswoman “back” because she happens\nto be black. Everyone in every mainstream political party in this country, has\na responsibility to make sure we don’t go down that road.\nPublished in the Huffington Post\nback ⇢",

Aren’t they fantastic.\nWe live in extraordinary times. In Boris Johnson we have a Prime Minister who: wasn’t elected by the public; has yet to win a vote in parliament, has no majority, has no support for his only apparent policy of crashing out of the EU without a deal.\nAnd whose own brother has resigned from his Cabinet. The first ever ministerial resignation to spend LESS time with your family.\nBut we live in extraordinarily serious times: violent crime is rising; there is a crisis of policing; a government in chaos over immigration policy.\nAnd this entire conference knows that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be a disaster for this country. That it would take years to recover from.\nNo Deal is a Boris Johnson project on behalf of Donald Trump. We would be subordinate to a United States currently led by one of the most right-wing presidents of modern times. The danger would be: no action on climate change; more wars; a sell-off of our public services like the NHS and an Americanisation of working conditions.\nAs the government’s own documents tell us, No Deal could create civil unrest, public disorder AND undermine our ability to tackle crime and terrorism. International crime is rising. But a No Deal Brexit would mean that: we would lose the European Arrest Warrant; we would lose real time access to important Europe wide databases on criminals, terrorists and missing persons. AND justice and security co-operation would be threatened.\nNOBODY who takes the security of this country seriously could support a No Deal Brexit.\nBy contrast Labour will defend the safety and security of all our citizens. And that includes: job security; a secure home; safe streets; and security from international crime. The Tories have failed on all fronts. Just ask the victims of crime, or the people who watched their neighbours’ burn to death in Grenfell Tower.\nEven Tory ministers now admit that there is a crisis of rising crime, and that police cuts have contributed. They are promising to recruit more police. But Boris Johnson and the others did NOTHING to stop the 20,000 cuts to police officers the Tories have made since Two-Thousand-And-Ten.\nAnd let’s not forget the LibDems. They would rather the public didn’t remember that their leader was in the Cabinet when most of those police cuts were made. AND the cuts to NHS. AND the cuts to welfare.\nThere is no question that the cuts in police numbers have contributed to the rise in crime. But other contributors are the cuts to education, the increase in school exclusions, all the zero hours contracts, all the homelessness and inequality, all the cuts in mental health services. Have also played their part.\nAnd these are all TORY policies. When they say they will lead the fight against crime – do not believe a word of it. They are the ones who have CREATED the conditions for rising serious and violent crime. Senior police officers are increasingly going on record and saying that cuts to public services have created an environment where crime flourishes. Cuts have consequences. You cannot keep people safe on the cheap.\nLabour in government will address the ravages of austerity at every level. It is well-known that we have already committed to recruiting thousands of extra police officers. We will recruit THOUSANDS of real police officers to the frontline. For all their big talk about recruiting more police officers, the Tories seem to be relying on taking people out of police administration and putting them in a uniform.\nUnlike this government, we aren’t encouraging more school exclusions. Children should be in school, otherwise they will be schooled by gangs. We will tackle mental health care underfunding and inequalities. We will build new homes and outlaw zero hours contracts. We will tackle the causes of crime.\nAnd when I travel up and down the country talking to people about their concerns about crime and public order, they often mention the cuts to the Youth Service. Labour is listening. Soon we will soon be announcing details of an entirely new Youth Service to address the issues of: educational exclusion; a lack of role models: inequality and deprivation among our young people. My brilliant colleague the Shadow Minister Cat Smith will be leading on this.\nThe Tories are insulting our intelligence if they think the public will simply forget who caused this crisis of law and order.\nThey insult us too with their election platform. They think that can win votes with dog-whistle racism. Led by a man who described veiled Muslim women, as looking like letter boxes or bank robbers. And Boris Johnson has STILL not got round to apologising\nThe Tories’ rhetoric on immigration is just as false as it is on law and order. They promised to cut net migration to 100,000 a year. They lied. It never happened. They claimed international graduates should leave the country after finishing their degrees, because they were overstaying. The Tories have now done a U-turn to allow graduates to stay and work.\nThey said they would end the ‘hostile environment’ and end the scandal of Windrush. They have emphatically not ended the suffering of the victims of Windrush.\nThey said they would treat the EU 3 Million fairly. They have not done so. And the situation of EU migrants is a Windrush scandal in the making.\nWe WILL end the Windrush scandal. We WILL ensure justice for Grenfell. And We wIll uphold all the rights of the EU 3 Million. We will tackle the scourge of knife crime and the underlying causes of crime. We will repeal the 2014 Immigration Act and end the Tory ‘hostile environment’.\nElection after election, Tories weaponise immigration, they weaponise anti-foreigner sentiment, and they use coded and un-coded racism to distract from their attacks on the livelihoods and living standards of ordinary working people, whatever their colour. But Labour under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn will not play the Tories game. We want to bring communities together.\nThe fact is that immigration is a net benefit to this country. Our businesses, our universities, our public services, would be worse off without it. Our NHS would collapse without immigration. And removing Freedom of Movement rights already granted, would be against the law.\nLabour thanks all the migrants who have come here: helped to build and run our NHS; sustain social care; serve in the public sector; work in industry and have enrich our society\nAnd I’ll let the Tories into a secret. The British public increasingly agrees with Labour Party and its positive view immigration. Back in 2011 most people when polled said immigration generally had a NEGATIVE impact. Earlier this year pollsters found that increasing numbers of people were saying the OPPOSITE and that immigration has generally had a POSITIVE impact. The Tories are selling snake oil. But the British public aren’t buying it. The haters are still very noisy.\nBUT, haters gonna hate.\nBritain has changed. Labours leadership has changed. But it’s still the same old rabid Tories – just more extreme than the last lot.\nBoris Johnson and his Tories have no vision for our country. Only division.\nOurs will be a great reforming Labour government. We will welcome refugees, including child refugees.\nWe will proudly uphold the torture ban and treat the victims of torture with humanity, not detentions and deportations.\nWe will end indefinite immigration detention, and limit it to the 28 days MPs were originally promised.\nAND we will close Yarl’s Wood and Brook House detention centres and review the ENTIRE detention estate.\nWe will fund our police forces properly. And work to give our communities genuine security.\nWe will hold public inquiries into historic injustices – into Orgreave, into blacklisting.\nWe will release all papers relating to the Shrewsbury 24 trials and the 37 Cammell Laird shipyard workers.\nI owe everything in life to the Labour movement. There was a post war generation of socialists who campaigned against colonialism. There was the NHS orange juice and cod-liver oil. There was my free university education. And above all the chance to serve as Britain’s first black woman MP.\nWe are on the verge of a general election. And I believe that, under Jeremy’s leadership, with our policies, and your commitment we will win!\nback ⇢",

As Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander MP put it “Cameron dodged the questions but truth is he's wasted 9 months picking a fight with people who keep our NHS running.”\n#LabourINforBritain\nThe Prime Minister announced the terms and date of a referendum on Britain’s EU membership thi week.\nThe #LabourINforBritain campaign will point out the positives brought by our continuing EU membership, including explaining how millions of British jobs are linked to our EU membership, £26.5 billion is invested in Britain by EU countries every year and British workers benefit from EU agreements on workers’ rights, including the right to holiday pay, paid maternity and paternity leave, anti-discrimination laws, equal pay and protection for agency workers.\nMeanwhile, London Mayor Boris Johnson has announced that he will campaign for Britain to leave the EU.

McDonald on the developing humanitarian crisis in Greece.\nYou can watch the debate here and read the debate transcript here.\nLabour forces delay to Chancellor’s crude housing benefit cuts\nThree weeks ago Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked David Cameron whether he would carry out an impact assessment of his planned cuts to supported housing benefit, which thousands of elderly and vulnerable people depend on (see video here.) Now, the government has announced a delay to a cut to housing benefit which Labour has warned will affect thousands of elderly and vulnerable people.\nResponding to the Government announcement John Healey MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Housing, said “The Chancellor’s crude cuts to housing benefit are set to close thousands of specialist homes for elderly and vulnerable people [but] just weeks after Ministers insisted they were pressing ahead with these damaging plans, they have now backtracked and said they’ll delay the implementation of these cuts,” adding that “this is a victory for common sense and overdue recognition that the Chancellor’s cuts plans are in complete chaos.”\nOsborne’s failure to deliver on new housing stock is blowing out the Housing Benefit Bill\nData released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has revealed that nationally private rental prices paid by tenants rose by 2.6% in the 12 months to January.\nThe ONS data – which showed the situation was even worse for private renters in London, where rental prices increased by 3.9% - comes on the back of a little noticed official benefit expenditure forecasts slipped out by the Department for Work and Pensions in February. These revealed that the total amount of Housing Benefit the government now expects to pay over £8.5 billion (in today’s prices) in housing benefit to private landlords in 2020-21, £350m more than it forecast at the time of George Osborne’s summer budget.\nSeema Malhotra MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who challenged George Osborne on his support for housebuilding during Treasury Questions last week, said: “British families are now literally paying the price for George Osborne’s failure to deliver enough affordable housing to buy and rent, “adding that “it’s bad news for public finances too [as] housing Benefit paid to private landlords is soaring because of lack of housebuilding.”\nTory austerity leads to alarming rise in child poverty\nA report issued by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has contained the alarming figures that by the end of this Tory government one in four children will be living in relative poverty with a rise to 2.6 million children living in absolute poverty.\nResponding to the report, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP said \"As the report clearly states, the government’s planned tax and benefit changes are a major reason for these rises in relative and absolute poverty over the next 5 years. If you could take out the Tory planned regressive reforms then you would be able to take out the Tory increases in child poverty too.”\nWomen to lose out in pension changes\nLabour has repeatedly called on the government to bring forward proposals for transitional arrangements for women adversely affected by the speeding up of the state pension age. This issue is of growing prominence as women affected by both the 1995 and 2011 Pension Acts begin to retire in July this year. Over the next four years, women’s state pension age will rise by nearly three years.\nLabour supports the equalisation of the State Pension age for women to 65. What we don’t support is the unfair way this Government is implementing the changes. With little personal notice, the Government brought forward the timetable for change. Women’s State Pension age will now be 65 by 2018 and 66 by 2020, instead of 65 by 2020 as was previously promised.\nSo recently Labour held an opposition day debate and forced a vote on transitional state pension arrangements, making it clear that it’s not good enough for the Tories to just look the other way. We need to keep up the pressure on Ministers to address this injustice. Inaction is no longer an option.\nInternational Development Matters – The stealth aid raid: militarising Britain's development budget\nI have written an article expressing my concerns that with regards to our International Development budget “people will find themselves to be sadly mistaken in thinking that the £12 billion they pay each year in taxes towards Britain’s aid budget is deployed only to reduce poverty in the developing world” as concerns grow that the Government is militarising Britain’s development budget.

This marks an astonishing cut of 40% in real terms.\nOf those that responded, 88% had seen at least one youth centre in their area close.\nThey also reveal since 2011 a 51% drop in the overall number of youth centres supported by English local authorities and a 42% drop in youth service staff.\nSeparate Labour research has previously found £880m of cuts to youth service spending since 2010 – £70 per child – and that half of councils have cut spending per young person by more than three-quarters.\nWhilst it is important to understand that the comparison made here is not a direct, like for like comparison, as council and policing areas differ, the APPG’s study also suggests that four areas worst-hit by youth spending cuts also saw some of the biggest knife crime rises.\nThe research makes clear that police forces serving areas with the biggest cuts have also seen some of the highest increases in knife crime, such as West Midlands Police, the Metropolitan Police, Cambridgeshire Police, and Thames Valley Police.\nSpecifically, West Midlands Police has seen an 87% increase in knife crime offences since 2013/14. There has been a 47% rise for the Metropolitan Police, a 95% increase for Cambridgeshire Police, and a 99% increase for Thames Valley.\nChildren's charity Barnardo's, which supported the research, said the figures were \"alarming but sadly unsurprising,\" adding that “taking away youth workers and safe spaces in the community contributes to a ‘poverty of hope’ among young people who see little or no chance of a positive future,” and that, “the government needs to work with local authorities to ensure they have enough funding to run vital services and restore children’s sense of hope.”\nThe report follows the Tory peer Seb Coe recently condemning the government’s big cuts to youth services, saying that “We’ve strangled the life out of the youth services in this country, yet we are surprised that we have big problems in our inner cities.”\nAdditionally, Sir Keith Mills, deputy chair of the London 2012 Olympics organising committee, has also noted the link between the rise in gang violence and cuts to youth clubs and youth access to sports programmes.\nAnd earlier this year, Gavin McKenna, a former gang member who now runs the Reach Every Generation group, said austerity was fuelling knife crime, and commented that “Youth clubs are missing, [and] there’s no safe place in their communities to go.”\nThese cuts to youth services, of course, go alongside the Tories devastating, and continuing, cuts to our police, axing 21,000 officers.\nYet ministers continue to refuse to accept that their cuts to police forces have had any impact either on crime levels or the ability to apprehend the criminals.\nThe reality though is that these cuts have directly led to an unfolding crisis in our police services, with (to give just one example) the Greater Manchester chief constable Ian Hopkins recently saying that 60 per cent of crimes are not investigated.\nThe overall picture is that the Tories have overseen nearly a decade of the most savage cuts to policing, education, mental health and youth services, and remain in denial about how their reckless austerity policies have led to this crisis.\nSo, whilst the Home Secretary can say ‘public health approach’ to knife and violent crime in as many speeches as he likes, until his government actually implements a fully resourced, genuine, cross departmental public health strategy, - alongside an end to the cuts - this is just hot air, and nothing will change.\nIt’s also important to note that the Tories are increasingly isolated when it comes to their continual denials regarding the consequences of their cuts, as more and more of the public simply don’t believe them.\nReturning to the theme of this week’s report, as the APPG Chair Sarah Jones MP said, youth services cannot just be \"nice to have,\" and “we cannot hope to turn around the knife crime epidemic if we don't invest in our young people.”\nIn my constituency, when I speak to young people there, they all tell me they need more safe spaces and more positive activities. It is vital that we invest in our future and that’s why the APPG is quite right to call for the government to review youth funding cuts.\nLabour in government will introduce legislation to guarantee quality youth services for all of our young people and we will give our councils the funding they need to invest in our public services.\nFor the safety and security of all our communities, it’s time to end the reckless cuts and invest in our future.\nPublished: Morning Star Online\nback ⇢",

Without that plan, we have had unnecessary uncertainty, speculation and a running commentary on the Government’s likely approach.”\nLabour will hold the Government to account on Brexit following Wednesday’s debate in parliament.

A&E departments are facing immense pressure, around 3.9 million people are on the waiting list and this situation could deteriorate over the winter months.\nThe Tories are to blame for the deepening crisis in our NHS.

We will also ensure that work will always pay under Universal Credit, to put an end to in-work poverty.\nTories have the wrong plans for Britain’s railways but Labour will end the railway rip-off\nThere has been public outcry over the last week in response to Government plans to give responsibility for rail tracks to private train operators. Train operating companies, some of which run abysmal services, should not be invited to take responsibility for the repair and maintenance of Britain’s railways.\nAdditionally, this week we have heard the news that rail fares are to rise by 2.3 per cent on average from next year.\nAs Andy McDonald MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary said “It is time for our railways to be run under public ownership in the public interest, when franchises expire, with affordable fares for all and long term investment in the railway network.”\nLow income black and Asian women hit hard by Tory austerity\nNew research by the Women’s Budget Group and the Runnymede Trust has shown that low income black and Asian women will lose more money than any other group up to 2020 as a result of the Tories’ economic policy.\nAs Dawn Butler MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Diverse Communities, said “This equality impact assessment is a damning indictment of this government and shows that black and Asian women are being disproportionately affected by this government’s policies.”\nRather than learn from her mistakes as Home Secretary on Immigration, Theresa May now seems committed to repeating them\nI issued a press release this week in my capacity as Shadow Home Secretary in response to latest immigration data, saying “The Tories made a promise to the British people on net migration that they knew they could never keep, eroding public trust. But rather than learn from her mistakes as Home Secretary, Theresa May now seems committed to repeating them.\n“We now know that at the same time she was cutting the border force, she tried to force schools into objectionable schemes that would hurt children in a failed effort to meet that target.\n“We should welcome overseas students and the contribution they make to our universities and wider society, and yet the Tories seem determined to discourage them.\n“Scandalously, the number of asylum applications from Syria has gone down, even though we know the crisis there is deepening.\n“And now Theresa May is refusing to provide certainty about the future of EU nationals who have lived and worked here for years.\n“Rather than making unworkable promises, using our neighbours as bargaining chips, or forcing schools to act as border guards, Labour will have a fair migration policy that benefits us all.”\n- This week, I have also written a piece on how Labour is for fair migration policies that benefit the population as a whole, plus a policy of investment that will improve the living standards for the overwhelming majority of people.

It was the first organisation of it’s kind at the time and I am very proud that it is still continuing strong today.\nAs ever, ‘Black Women Mean Business’ remains a not-for-profit group with a simple agenda; to support, encourage and celebrate black women involved in business as well as black entrepreneurship in general.\nWe hold fantastic and varied events throughout the year, including conferences, receptions, workshops and discussion forums, to advance our aims. Over the years, i have been greatful for all the inspirational guests and business leaders who have spoken at our events. These include Iyanla Vanzant, renowned US motivational speaker; Trevor Phillips, current head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission; Brenda Emmanus, Television presenter and leading businesswoman; Kanya King, MBE, founder of the MOBO organisation and awards; Moria Stuart, pioneering newspresenter and reader; Kwame Kwei-Armah actor. The ‘Black Women Mean Business’ events are trully a great opportunity for networking and discussing ideas with and amongst black businesswomen.\nCurrently, there are around 500 women members of ‘Black Women Mean Business’, many of whom are actively involved in a range of small to medium businesses. Recently however, groups that are looking to increase diversity in their particular business sectors, such as the teaching and the fire service sectors, have also begun to make contact with us. As a result, ‘Black Women Mean Business’ is now expanding to work with organisations who encourage diversity inside the workplace too.\nFor more information on this initiative, visit\nwww.bwmb.org\nDiversity in the Workplace\nThe Employability Forum is an organisation working with refugee and migrants to help them into work in the UK. The organisation is currently working on a project to increase diversity within the teaching profession in London.\nLondon Schools\nand the Black Child\nLondon Schools and the Black Child (LSBC) is an initiative I started during the 1990s as a way to try and tackle the problem of educational under-attainment amongst London's Black students.\nThis initiative is still going strong and, to date, has had many pleasing successes. Perhaps the biggest of these being the 2003 launch of the 'Aiming High' programme, the first ever government programme for supporting educational achievement among Afro-Caribbean pupils.\nEvery year, with the Mayor of London, I co-host a London-wide conference to bring together teachers, children, parents, educators and relevant groups. Together we discuss the obstacles and solutions for increasing educational attainment in London and beyond. As well as this, I also host an anunal, London-wide awards to recognise and celebrate those black students who have manage to excel and impress academically.\nSince begining the LSBC initiative, i have witnessed amazing changes in black educational attainment across London and the UK. The achievement gap has been steadily narrowing and black children have made serious progress in schools. In addition, more black teachers are being recruited to industry than ever before, helping London's teaching workforce to look more like the communities they serve.\nI am very proud of these achievements, but there is still very much to do. It is still the case that black boys are more likely to be excluded from school than their peers, and studies continue to highlight the disproportionately negative treatment black children are given in the education system, from pre-school assessment right through to the crucial secondary years. These are issues I continue to campaign for through the LSBC initiative.\nFor more information on this initiative, visit\nwww.blackeducation.info\nThe Diane Abbott Foundation\nThe Diane Abbott Foundation undertakes research into the causes, and manifestations of, racial disparity in the United Kingdom. It brings together the work of the London Schools and the Black Child and Black Women Mean Business to provide training, mentorship, counselling and advocacy for black children in the school system and black business women.\nThe Diane Abbott Foundation is an independent registered charity that was created to formalise, extend and increase the capacity of Diane Abbott MP's work around inequality in education and employment.\nOur activities are regulated by the Charity Commission. The decision on how our funds are used is made by a board of independent Trustees. The foundation’s primary aim is to provide advocacy and advice, give grants to organisations that work with or for the benefit of Black British people, and sponsor and undertake research into racial disparity.\nFor more information on this initiative, visit\nhttps://dianeabbottfoundation.org",
  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_articles_item1709/content_60.html": "The Nationality and Borders Bill is a reactionary law in search of a problem\nThe latest legislation from this government tramples on our history of being a country that accepts refugees. It also flies in the face of the spirit of international law and may be in breach of its letter too. It will criminalise some of the most vulnerable people on the planet: people desperate enough to cross open seas in dinghies. All of this is completely unnecessary, the result of a frenzy of xenophobia from this government and the more sensationalist tabloids.\nSome ministers admit it will not address the issue of asylum seekers trying to cross the Channel. The draconian legislation follows the serial failures of the British government to reach an agreement with their French counterparts. They are both guilty of failing to care humanely for desperate people. But it is unfathomable how the British government imagined that there could be co-operation without serious negotiation. The Tory version of post-Brexit ‘Global Britain’ means never having to negotiate, or if forced to, never sticking to agreements.\nThere should be no doubt that the legislation is draconian. It is reported that the Bill will contain measures for life sentences for anyone convicted of ‘people-smuggling’. As the Mr Bigs in these operations don’t actually set sail themselves, this will be punishing small fry at most, or even people who have retuned to fetch other family members.\nBut the act of seeking asylum itself will be criminalised if refugees do not arrive directly at the ports and airports with full documentation. This completely ignores the plight of those seeking refuge. It is not certain that all of us could lay our hands on all necessary documents if we suddenly had to flee a country, still less if bombs were raining down, or some ISIS offshoot had just invaded your town or city, or civil war had broken out over dwindling water resources.\nAll of this is compounded by the reported plans for an asylum processing centre in Rwanda. Until recently most asylum seekers in this country came from Syria. More recently, the top countries that refugees are fleeing from to this country are Iran, Iraq, Albania, Eritrea, and Sudan. The idea that Rwanda, or any country could be an alternative for people seeking asylum here is completely inappropriate. People are seeking safety, not trial by ordeal.\nMany of us, campaigners, MPs and others have long argued for the establishment of safe and legal routes for refugees from a number of crisis or war-torn areas. This would allow the smoothest access for people who are facing persecution or worse. It would also overcome the need for desperate journeys across the Channel.\nBut the government is doing the opposite. Punishing asylum-seekers and establishing an overseas processing centre to deny asylum are undoubtedly in breach of the spirit of international law. There is a right under international law to seek asylum. It remains to be seen whether the government will fall foul of the law itself, in breaching the right to asylum.\nFurther legislation is planned that will also attempt to make the government less accountable to the courts. It seems clear that at least part of this motivation for this is so as to bypass the objections of immigration lawyers, who try to ensure the rights of asylum-seekers are upheld.\nInevitably, for such a terrible policy, the entire framework for this policy is based on a falsehood. The government claims that we are being swamped, because the numbers crossing the Channel have risen. But the numbers are tiny in comparison to overall migration.\nThe Refugee Council estimates that 9,000 people who would be able to make a successful asylum claim will be denied if the government’s proposals are adopted. That alone is shameful. These numbers are minuscule.\nCurrently 5.6 million people from the EU are entitled to seek settled status in this country, although they are facing the usual thoughtlessness and incompetence from the Home Office. In addition, the government says it will grant leave to remain to holders of British National Overseas passports from Hong Kong, meaning that potentially hundreds of thousands of extra people could come to this country.\nThe government’s plans are addressing a non-existent problem. It is a part of its reactionary and authoritarian social policy, with no regard for fundamental human rights.\nback ⇢",

However to say that because the vote went the wrong way we are going to ignore the votes of millions of people up and down the country, would be a blow to democracy.\nThis does not mean that we have to accept Brexit in the haphazard way in which it is being handed to us. I like many are rightfully concerned about Theresa May’s Brexit. A Brexit in accordance with Tory values.\nI was in Parliament for the Maastricht Treaty, which was just a revision to the EU Treaty. We debated it for forty-two days. MPs have been given just five days to debate coming out of the EU all together. This demonstrates how arrogant Theresa May is, how much she does not want to involve Parliament, and how much she wants to bulldoze things through.\nThe passage of this Bill has been a challenge for Labour. Our MPs represent the top six most passionately pro-leave constituencies, and the six most passionately pro-remain constituencies.\nFollowing the decision taken by the Shadow Cabinet on voting for the Article 50 Bill, I voted for the Bill as a loyal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and a loyal member of the Shadow Cabinet.\nLabour will continue to oppose Theresa May’s intention to carry out a ‘Hard Brexit’. We will continue to fight for jobs and living standards, to protect workers’ rights and environmental standards and the rights of EU citizens, which are all under threat.\nSale of the student loan book is a bad deal for students and the tax-payer\nThe Government this week announced the sale of the student loan book. The Tories have tried to do this before, but abandoned the idea when they realised it was a bad deal for students and a bad deal for the tax-payer.\nAs Angela Rayner MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Education, said \"This Government never learn any lessons – this sale will do nothing to ease the burden of debt piled on students by the Tories who have trebled tuition fees and scrapped maintenance grants.”\nLabour has committed to restoring maintenance grants to help young people from all backgrounds have access to University and will oppose this sale of the student loan book.\nThe Government’s disappointing proposals fall far short of what is needed to tackle the housing crisis\nGovernment announcements on renting this week fall far short of what is needed and show the Tories are failing to get to grip with the housing crisis.\nAffordable housebuilding has fallen to the lowest level in 24 years, with the number of homes being built for social rent now at the lowest level since records began.\nAs we all know, here in London and Hackney, the crisis is becoming more and more acute.\nLast year, ministers even voted down Labour’s efforts to ensure that private rented homes were simply fit for human habitation.\nNow ministers continue to do next to nothing to help people who rent from a private landlord and have consistently blocked Labour’s attempts to change the law to control costs and give renters security.\nTory Policies mean that NHS recruits are driven away before they’ve even started\nUCAS figures published last week show that applications for undergraduate nursing degrees starting in September 2017 are down 23 percent compared with the previous year.\nThe Government have been warned repeatedly that cutting bursaries and funding for student nurses would cut off the future supply of NHS staff, yet the Tories have failed to change course.\nThese measures have come alongside misguided reductions in training places under the Tory Government and a permanent pay squeeze, meaning that the NHS is becoming dangerously short of staff.\nPatients are seeing wards closed, operations cancelled and treatments delayed, but the Tories are still burying their heads in the sand about the crisis in the NHS.\nBritain on course for the biggest increase in inequality since Thatcher\nA Resolution Foundation report issued last week showed that Britain is on course for the biggest increase in inequality since Thatcher.\nAs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell put it, “this report is damning of the unfair economic policies of this Chancellor, as the gap between working families and a wealthy few gets wider, with the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer. It demonstrates to us all once again that the economy under a Tory government will be rigged for those at the top, with poor and middle income households facing their worst Parliament for income growth since the 1960s.”\nLabour called on the Government at the Autumn Statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor, going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority.\nIt is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the majority – in contrast to this, Labour is committed to making our economy work for the majority people, with proper investment to ensure no one and no community is left behind.\nThe inadequate housing system for refugees is a disgrace\nA report from Parliament’s Cross-Party Home Affairs Select Committee has delivered a devastating critique of the system of housing for those who apply to be a refugee in 21st century Britain.\nMy colleague Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Committee, described some of the conditions as simply a “disgrace,” with reports of people being placed in accommodation with infestations of mice, rats and bedbugs. Findings also confirmed there is inadequate support for victims of rape and torture.\nAs many of us have felt for some time, the committee also found that the “dispersal” scheme used to place asylum seekers around the country simply doesn’t work. As the scheme is voluntary, some local authorities are not taking part, meaning that applicants are more concentrated in a small number of areas, including some of the most deprived areas.\nFor example, while there are 1,042 asylum seekers housed in Bolton and 1,029 in Rochdale, there are none at all in Theresa May’s Maidenhead constituency and only 88 housed in the Hastings and Rye constituency of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.\nback ⇢",

But they rarely involve our most vulnerable children, victimisation of their teachers, TV shows about the mistreatment of the elderly and vulnerable in care homes and offshore financial funds worth hundreds of millions. But all of that, and more, has come to light at the Leaways school in Hackney.\nI have taken a close interest in this dispute, appearing on picket lines, producing a video and speaking at a public meeting in support of the teachers. Leaways is a privately-owned special school for autistic children and others with special needs. It reportedly charges £50,000 per pupil, a cost which is largely met by the public sector. Unfortunately, having been there, it is little more than a converted warehouse and it is surprising that it passes any suitability test as premises for teaching some of our most vulnerable children.\nThe school is owned by the Kedleston Group, and ultimate ownership is with an offshore fund based in a tax haven in Jersey, presumably to avoid tax on profits. The owners, the Brosnan family of Irish financiers, are no strangers to controversy. They featured in a BBC Panorama documentary showing patients being slapped and restrained under chairs at Winterbourne View, a Bristol care home operated by Castlebeck – a company then owned by Denis Brosnan's Jersey-based Lydian Capital. Paul Brosnan was chairman of Castlebeck at the time and resigned in the aftermath. Another family-owned firm was involved in the death of a 2-year old at one of its nurseries. So, itis also surprising that the family could pass any ‘fit and proper person’ test.\nThe NEU union is right to fight for recognition and against victimisation of its representative. It is a basic right to join or organise a union, and it seems inappropriate that any public money is provided to an employer that tries to ban or bust unions. Hackney Council should examine its relationship with Leaways as a matter of urgency.\nBut it also highlights the problem of public services like education being turned over to offshore private sector interests whose motive is profit, not public good. This has been government policy for many years, and the events at Leaways show just how damaging it can be. The services provided by outfits like Kedleston can and should be provided better and cheaper in the public sector.\nback ⇢",

She is a British teenager who fled her home in Bethnal Green, aged 15, with two school friends to join Isis in Syria. They caused a sensation at the time. The CCTV images of the three girls were featured in every newspaper and media outlet. One of the three friends is now dead, the other is still with ISIS. But Shamima has surfaced in a refugee camp asking, via interviews with journalists, to go back to her family in Bethnal Green.\nShe is now nineteen. And anyone seeing this sad teenager on the television, mouthing her ISIS “lines to take” will see a groomed and abused young women. She has seen unimaginable horrors. Furthermore two of her children have died and she nurses a third in her arms, terrified this one will also die. Anyone can see that she has been groomed. Anyone that is, apart from tabloid newspaper editors and our Home Secretary, Sajid Javid. As far as the tabloid press is concerned, their hostility is a little surprising. You might think society had got past blaming groomed young teenagers for their fate after the big child sex exploitation scandals in towns like Rotherham. But Shamima is being treated as cruelly and dismissively as those other young victims originally were.\nHowever the tabloid editors are just selling newspapers. Home Secretary, Sajid Javid is responsible for the rule of law. And his attitude to the law in Shamima’s case is deeply troubling. International law is clear. Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says: “Everyone has a right to a nationality. No-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality” On Monday of this week Sajid Javid seemed to accept this. He told the House of Commons “We must of course observe international law. And we cannot strip someone of their British nationality if doing so would leave them stateless” But by Wednesday, after a barrage of media and commentary hostile to Shamima, he appeared to do a u-turn and announced that he is stripping her of her British nationality.\nIt is claimed that he can do that because she is entitled to Bangladeshi nationality by descent, and so will not be left stateless. The trouble is she has never been to Bangladesh, does not hold a Bangladeshi passport, and the Bangladeshi government is quite firm that they will not be giving her one. Furthermore the Home Office last year lost two cases where it tried to strip people of British nationality on the basis that they were entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship by descent. This case will also ultimately be decided by the courts. So the Home Secretary has effectively left Shamima stateless, contrary to international law. In the meantime, Shamima is trapped in a refugee camp in Syria hoping her third baby won’t die like the others.\nThere are plenty of good reasons to allow Shamima to return home. She could be questioned on how she was groomed. She is potentially an important source of information about ISIS and their recruiters. And she could be interrogated more generally and, if appropriate, put on trial. This is certainly the view of the President of the United States. Donald Trump has said “The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back the over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial” Stripping Shamima of her nationality in, what appears to be, a wholly arbitrary fashion solves\nnothing.\nThe suspicion has to be that Sajid Javid has stripped her of her nationality to appear tough in the eyes of the right wing media and his own party members. He must believe this can only help him in the event of any forthcoming Tory leadership election. And he must be gambling that by the time the court proceedings are finished any leadership election is long over.\nQuestion. When can a desperate groomed teenager, with a week old baby, be left thousands of miles from home without any help?\nAnswer. When it interferes with the leadership ambitions of Sajid Javid\nhttps://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/diane-abbott-shamima-begum-grooming-14033947\nback ⇢",

There is no doubt that she was a striking figure in a Parliament much more overwhelmingly male and elderly than it is today. And there is no doubt also that most of the serried ranks of Tory men sitting behind her in the chamber of the House of Commons were terrified of her. On the Labour opposition benches, we would speculate as to why that might be. Many of us concluded that it was because of the fraught relationship some of these upper class men may have had with their nannies.\nIt is also beyond question that Margaret Thatcher was a transformative figure. But the issue is that was the transformations she wrought in British politics, the economy and society all for the good. Part of the reason why, at the distance of forty years, the Thatcher years have something of a rosy glow is the extent to which New Labour quietly accepted much of her policy thrust. Her Chancellor Geoffrey Howe said “Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible.” What Margaret this shows us is that a genuinely radical leadership can create lasting change.\nOne of the transformations often ascribed to Margaret Thatcher was attitudes to women in politics. But the truth is that, although there was symbolic value to Margaret Thatcher being Britain’s first woman Prime Minister (and it was very much part of her “brand”) in practise Margaret Thatcher did next to nothing for women in politics, including in the Tory Party. At many points in her premiership she had fewer women in her cabinet than her male Tory predecessors. This is by contrast with her successor Theresa May who, whatever her other faults, has systematically promoted talented women. Just recently she has promoted a woman to Secretary of State for Defence. Margaret Thatcher, however, seemed always to want to be the queen bee surrounded by flocks of docile men (although Michael Hesteltine had other ideas)\nWhere Margaret Thatcher did achieve real transformation, although a malign one, was the levels of inequality which spiralled in her era. Until she became Prime Minister Britain had become a steadily more equal nation. The process had begun during the post-war years. The data available shows that the share of income going to the top 10% of the population fell over the 40 years to 1979, from 34.6% in 1938 to 21% in 1979, while the share going to the bottom 10% rose slightly. But as soon as Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979 this process of narrowing inequality reversed sharply. Inequality rose considerably over the 1980s, reaching a peak in 1990. There are many aspects of Margaret Thatcher’s policies which may have increased inequality, but her systematic weakening of trade unions (what she described as “flexible labour markets) was undoubtedly part of it.\nBut perhaps the most fundamental way in which Margaret Thatcher transformed the British economy was the way in which, on her watch, the process began where speculation and financial trading became more important to the economy than industry. Some of\nthis was inevitable; employment is always changing.\nBut the Thatcher de-industrialisation was ruthlessly executed. It reached its peak with her year-long confrontation with the National Union of Mineworkers. Margaret Thatcher defines miners as “the enemy within” She won, but to this day decimated mining communities struggle with the social and economic consequences. More widely, unions have never recovered the same power.\nIn the Big Bang, banking deregulation, tax cuts and ‘loadsamoney’ culture she fostered were the origins of the 2008 global financial crisis. While Norway built up an enormous sovereign wealth funds with the proceeds of North Sea oil, Thatcher and Lawson frittered it away with tax cuts. This led directly to the unsustainable ‘Lawson boom’, which ended with yet another crash.\nIn fact, contrary to widespread assertion, Thatcher’s economic record was an extremely poor one, much worse than the preceding comparable period when Britain had become ‘the sick man of Europe’. In 30 years between 1949 and 1979 real GDP more than doubled. But in 30 years from 1979 to 2009, which were the Thatcher-Major-New Labour years, the economy grew at a considerably slower rate. In terms of per capita GDP, which goes to people’s prosperity, the contrast is even more stark. In the 30 year before Thatcher real per capital GDP almost doubled, but in 30 years of her era it only grew by a little over half.\nMargaret Thatcher is mostly remembered for the poll tax, the miners’ strike and the Falklands war. Her transformative effect on the British economy deserves to be equally well remembered. Remembered but not admired.\nPublished: Politics Home\nback ⇢",

Almost everything\nAlthough the Windrush scandal has been widely discussed since January 2018, there is still no proper government compensation scheme in place. Tory ministers have also repeatedly refused to allow an interim system of hardship payments.\nThis is despite the fact that people entitled to be here, British citizens, have been denied jobs, homes and public services. Some of them were wrongfully kept in immigration detention or even deported. Because this is an ageing cohort, some of the victims have already died before there has been any redress.\nSimply providing compensation for the losses incurred should be the least this government can do. It is quite true that successive governments treated the Windrush victims badly, including unfortunately Labour governments. But it was this government which introduced the 2014 Immigration Act, which is the legal basis for the ‘hostile environment’.\nIt is this Tory government policy which led directly to the scandal, just as many of us warned at the time that it would. The ‘hostile environment’ demands that a whole range of public sector workers, nurses, teachers, police officers and DWP officials act as internal border guards, along with others in the private sector such as bank workers, landlords and employers. If they were unable to see the relevant documents, they were supposed to report the victims as potential illegal immigrants. Of course, many in the Windrush generation, who actually come from all over the Commonwealth, were never provided with that documentation in the first place.\nIn order to redress a burning injustice like this, the government should take an open-handed and fair-minded approach. Instead it does the opposite. When the compensation scheme was first announced, the Labour party argued that it should be set on a statutory footing, like the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. One effect would be to ensure that the levels of compensation would be comparable to awards in civil cases.\nBut the government rejected this approach. This seems to be driven by petty and vindictive penny-pinching. In effect, it is treating victims of its own policies, the Windrush cohort and their descendants, as less worthy than victims of crime by a third party. The treating of Windrush victims as second-class citizens continues.\nTo give some examples, for those refused re-entry to this country, people who may have travelled abroad for a holiday, or family occasion, there is no specific compensation at all. Legal costs, which may be considerable, will not be met in full. It will be extremely difficult to recover unpaid tax credits, because HMRC doesn’t really do compensation at all.\nFor those denied free higher education, they will have to pursue the relevant college or university and the Home Office will not pay them the compensation. For those deterred from entering higher education because of these unjustified fees, there is nothing at all. And so it goes on, one injustice piling upon another. In fact it has become increasingly clear that, in some cases, the Home Office itself will not be paying out any actual compensation. Instead it will be relying on third parties like the DWP to make good any financial loss caused by the Home Office’s own hostile environment policy.\nThere has been talk in Westminster that the government may try to introduce this, wholly inadequate, compensation scheme into primary legislation. It has even been suggested that ministers cannot authorise payments without legislation, which is simply untrue.\nThe truth is that ministers would be trying to railroad\nthrough a shoddy scheme in the dying days of a failed parliament. They then want\nto claim this as a legacy for a Prime Minister who actually bears a great\nresponsibility for the injustice in her time as Home Secretary. This would be preposterous.\nLabour\nopposes this shameful treatment of the Windrush victims. They deserve much\nbetter than this. Labour will continue to campaign for fair, speedy and just\ncompensation scheme. The Windrush generation deserve no less.\nback ⇢",

Labour will end the government’s failed policy of outsourcing vital services, writes DIANE ABBOTT\nSince then, the public have footed the bill for the £148million spent wrapping up Carillion’s accounts, despite the Tories insisting that “shareholders and not the taxpayer (are) taking the burden on this”.\nBut it’s not just Carillion.\nThere has been a string of outsourcing disasters across whole swathes of our public services in recent years, at both a central and local government level, and for too long the public have paid the price for outsourcing.\nRecently therefore, as part of our local election campaign, Labour has pledged to end the scandal of outsourcing services involving contact with people ‘at risk.’\nWe have outlined new guidelines for central and local government managing contracts for services which come into contact with ‘at risk’ people and exercise coercive state powers.\nThese kinds of services include assessments for sick and disabled people claiming social security, failures over substandard housing for our Armed Forces NHS care, the treatment of people in detention centres and prisons.\nExamples of these failures recently in the news have included the outsourcing of assessments for Personal Independent Payments (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA.)\nThese have led to nearly 300,000 claimants, six per cent of all those assessed, only receiving the correct award after challenging the decision; a breakdown in trust among disabled people, many of whom are concerned assessments are not being delivered fairly; and contractors failing to meet any key target on levels of unacceptable reports in any single period, with almost a third of PIP assessments considered not up to scratch.\nIn another example, Birmingham Prison has recently been taken over by the government from the private firm G4S, after inspectors said it had fallen into a \"state of crisis\".\nLabour’s plans mean that whenever a relevant contract expires or is terminated, central or local government will be required to assess whether a service involves significant contact with ‘at risk’ groups, exercise of coercive powers, or risk of infringement of people’s rights.\nIf the answer is “yes,” statutory guidance will be to bring the service back in house except in the cases outlined in detail at Labour.org.uk\nSome have falsely claimed that insourcing will be more expensive in response to the announcement, but in fact this doesn’t create costs for councils or departments that wouldn’t otherwise be incurred. When contracts expire, councils or departments already have to decide whether to open up outsourcing contracts for tender or to bring the service inhouse.\nIndeed, insourcing has, in many cases, been cheaper than the outsourcing option.\nAs Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour’s Shadow Communities and Local Government Secretary, said when announcing the policy, “Labour is proposing a radical new settlement that gives people the power to end outsourcing and decide for themselves how best to deliver the services they need.”\nThese latest announcements follow on from how the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour Party has consistently argued for an end to the Tories failed and ideologically-driven obsession with outsourcing and privatisation in recent years.\nIn my work as Shadow Home Secretary for example I have exposed and opposed in recent years how in the area of immigration detention we pay ten million pounds a year to private contractors to run Yarls Wood and Brook House detention centres.\nWe also had the grotesque spectacle of G4S being rewarded for failure at Brook House and at Tinsley House. A firm which oversaw the appalling, brutal treatment of detainees, and was exposed in the Panorama programme, got more money and a longer contract from the Tories.\nIn another shocking example of the human misery that can be caused by the Tories’ obsession with outsourcing, it was also revealed in that the Home Office paid Capita bonuses for deporting more people, explicitly incentivising Capita to profit from Theresa May’s ‘deport first ask questions later’ approach.\nIn contrast to the Tories, Labour will end this rotten system. We will take the millions that are used annually to fund Yarls Wood and Brook House immigration detention centres, and put this directly back into services to support the survivors of modern slavery, trafficking, and domestic violence.\nThis Government and its predecessors have long had an obsession with enriching the private sector from the public purse. This is despite whatever the cost, either financially, in shoddy service or in human misery.\nWith Labour this will end – as part of us rebuilding and transforming Britain, for the many not the few.\nhttps://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/we%E2%80%99re-ready-smash-privatisation\nback ⇢",

The Government have cut local government to the bone since 2010 and they continue to impose cut upon cut, hitting the most deprived areas the hardest.\nIt was recently confirmed that Hackney's central government grant for the next financial year will be reduced by a further £36m, bringing the total government reduction to £130m - or 35% - since 2010.\nCommunities and local Government Secretary, Greg Clark announced a £300million transitional grant for councils suffering the harshest cuts. Yet 85 per cent of the grant goes to the Tory authorities, which have suffered the least since 2010. Labour councils are to receive just 4% of the grant.\nSteve Reed, Labour’s Local Government Minister, said “Councils in poorer areas have suffered much harsher cuts since 2010 but they are getting next to nothing.”\nJEREMY HUNT IMPOSES CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS\nJeremy Hunt’s decision to impose a contract on junior doctors has led to an unprecedented situation in the NHS. He has completely failed to listen to junior doctors and has deliberately conflated the issue of the junior doctors contract with delivery of seven-day day services. Rather than helping to resolve this difficult dispute he is gambling with patient safety.\nFollowing the announcement, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said “More strikes now look likely. If that happens, it will be clear that the blame lies with the government, not the doctors.”\nHe has appealed to Jeremy Hunt that “even at this late stage, to go back and negotiate with the BMA”\nThe Labour party recognises the huge contribution junior doctors make and the years of training they go through to look after us.

  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_articles_item1635/content_43.html": "The latest Tory Immigration Bill will deepen the exploitation of workers\n26 Jan 2019\nThis week will see the second reading of the Tory Government’s latest Immigration Bill. It is extremely short. But the White Paper it is meant to enact represents one of the most serious threats to all workers fordecades.\nThe TUC and others have already raised concerns that as this bill risks limiting the rights of existing EU workers in the UK, mounting to literally millions of people, and more than a million UK citizens in the EU. And that it will severely increase the rates of exploitation in work.\nThe risk of super-exploitation will be built into the legal system. The new Immigration Bill introduces an entirely new work visa of just 12 months for what Tory Ministers persist in calling ‘low-skilled’ workers, who are in reality underpaid workers.\nThe government’s intention, as shown in its White Paper is not to severely limit or even substantially curb the flow of migrants. On the contrary, just like the never met ‘net migration target of under 100,000 people a year’ the government’s policy amounts to a permanent campaign against migration and migrants as a scapegoat for the effects of their own austerity policy.\nThe new system will no doubt be accompanied by lots of blood-curdling rhetoric about migrants, while at the same time encouraging just as many migrants to come, if not more. One of the White Paper’s central promises is that employers will be able to recruit all the ‘low-skilled’ workers they need. The euphemism used is preserving ‘access’ for business, which is mentioned 77 times in the White Paper.\nThe real difference is that under the new scheme, many migrant workers who come here will in effect have virtually no rights, to employment protection, health & safety, sickness pay, maternity leave and so on, simply because they will be temporary workers and under threat of deportation in 12 months’ time. The suspicion is that this time limit was itself chosen because anyone here for under one year does not officially count as a long-term migrant in the data.\nThese workers will be almost impossible to organise, or find it very difficult to organise themselves. They will have no right legal right to bring family members here, in breach of the UN’s right to a family life. They will be prey to the most unscrupulous employers.\nIt is widely known that some employers exploit overseas workers either because they are unaware of their rights or may not have the correct papers. Institutionalising that super-exploitation through immigration law potentially creates an entire cohort of low-paid, minimal rights overseas workers. If anyone overstays they can be forced by the worst employers to go ‘off the books’, with no National Insurance paid, no entitlement to sick or holiday pay and potentially below minimum wage rates.\nThe system is designed to attract the most desperate workers in the first place, workers who know in advance they will have to leave after 12 months, who will be separated from their families, and who are low paid. The Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes seems unsure whether employers will be asked to police this system, having given two entirely contradictory replies to this question in parliament. But anything which gives this power, effectively delegating the right to deport to bad employers, is a recipe for workplace exploitation of the worst kind. It runs counter to the government’s own claims to be tacking all forms of modern slavery.\nThe risk to the entire workforce of this country, especially those on lower pay, should be clear. The government has discussed setting a visa threshold at £30,000 a year, which is clearly an income threshold not a skills one. The government insults nurses, social care workers and most other workers by calling them low-skilled, when they are actually underpaid.\nEven for those in full-time work, the average pay is still below the suggested £30,000 level. If it were set at that level, all the first six grades for NHS nurses will be not be included as skilled. High-earning derivatives traders of course will be waved through!\nAny worker whose time-limited work visa has lapsed and reports abuses to the authorities could face prison or deportation. This in turn could have a negative impact on the pay and conditions on of all workers in all the sectors of the economy, or all grades earning below £30,000. The terrible effects of zero hours contracts on the wider workforce could pale into insignificance by comparison.\nThere is an argument for some strictly regulated short-term work contracts, to deal with seasonal work such as agriculture. The Tories scrapped the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme in 2013. The decline in seasonal pay and conditions in agriculture since means employers have struggled to employ sufficient workers in subsequent years. Crops have been left to rot. Labour is committed reintroducing the Scheme.\nIf there are other sectors, such as hospitality that also have seasonal spikes, we will listen. But there seasonal workers too, such as students and in all cases proper pay and conditions are required, and will be enforced by a Labour government.\nThe Tories are in a terrible mess on Brexit. Unwilling to confront real choices rather than fantasies, they have even begun to discuss a general election. Good. What we need is a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn.\nBut we should also be clear. Despite their ridiculous claims, the Tories will never be the party of the workers.\nThey will boast their Immigration Bill helps workers. This is entirely false. Their real agenda is an immigration system which intensifies the exploitation of migrant workers, and lowers pay and conditions for all.\nback ⇢",

But ministers arrogantly persist in claiming to have protected spending.\nThe substantial reductions to police budgets since 2010 already pose a threat to public safety, now these further cuts will simply apply more pressure on an already overstretched police service.\nAs I have argued in the media and in the House, Labour will be pushing ministers keep the promise they made and protect police spending.\nSocial care: Government must come forward with immediate funding and sustainable vision\nTime and time again, this Government has ignored warnings of the social care crisis, from health, social care and local government experts and from MPs across the political spectrum.\nThe latest Local Government Finance Settlement is no different to what’s come before.\nAs my colleague Teresa Pearce, Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, put it “It is all smoke and mirrors – pushing numbers around but not offering any new money. Shifting the burden on to council tax payers creates a postcode lottery in social care services. Wealthy areas will prosper whilst poorer communities will struggle. This was made clear by the revelation of the sweetheart deal offered to Surrey County Council behind closed doors, whilst the rest of the country suffers.”\nThe brutal cuts handed down by this Tory government will leave local councils facing a £5.8billion funding gap in just two years’ time. Libraries, youth centres and Sure Start centres have closed. Child protection services are creaking. Frail elderly people and vulnerable disabled people are being left lonely and isolated.\nThis is a crisis made in Westminster but, as per usual, the Tories are pushing the blame on to councils, communities, carers and families.\nIn the forthcoming budget, the Government must come forward with immediate funding, as well as a long-term, sustainable and strategic vision for social care.\nNHS trusts are already in a deficit of £886m\nFigures released this week show NHS trusts are already in a deficit of £886m and yet still the Prime Minister is burying her head in the sand when it comes to the extent of the NHS crisis.\nTheresa May’s sustained underfunding of the NHS is stretching the finances of NHS hospitals beyond their limits. Even with the £1.8bn that was set aside in the ‘financial reset’ last summer hospitals have already run up a deficit of £886m this year. It will take a heroic effort by NHS staff to meet even the predicted year-end target in the face of chronic neglect by the Government.\nThe Government needs to be honest about what this crisis means for patient care. It means cuts to frontline staff, longer waits for treatment and services at risk of closure. The money which had been set aside for NHS transformation funding, which should be improving services and bringing the deficit down in future, has instead had to be used to manage this year’s figures.\nMinisters are in denial, but the staggering decline in the NHS’s financial performance is a direct result of decisions they made. Cuts to social care have driven up hospital attendances while the Government’s inept workforce planning has forced hospitals to drain resources on expensive agency staff.\nThe Government urgently need to provide a long-term, sustainable financial package to guarantee the NHS services which patients need for the future.\nLabour will deliver a real living wage so that every worker earns enough to really live\nRebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, responded strongly this week to the release of the list of employers who have failed to pay the national minimum and living wage, saying “It is frankly disgraceful that a record number of employers have failed to pay their workers the basic minimum wage and hopefully the repercussions of being publicly named and shamed will act as a deterrent for other unscrupulous employers. However, the fact remains that the current so-called National Living Wage is that in name only. The Chancellor even announced a cut in the rate at the Autumn Statement last year, leaving 2.7 million people over £1,300 worse off by 2020.”\nCrippling cuts have demoralised and damaged the capacity of child protection services to protect vulnerable children\nAs Shadow Home Secretary this week I issued the following Press Release commenting on the Government’s announcement of measures to protect children and young people from sexual abuse, exploitation and trafficking:\n“This Government’s hypocrisy is startling. Councils will face a £1.9 billion funding gap in children’s services by 2020 and whilst this £40 million injection is welcome, it barely scratches the surface.\n“The reality is that the crippling cuts have demoralised and damaged the capacity of child protection services to protect vulnerable children.\n“Coupled with the shambolic handling of the Inquiry into Historic Child Sex Abuse, the treatment of the victims of child sex abuse and vulnerable children is inadequate and irresponsible.\n“We must ensure children are safe and it is unclear how the Government can prove they take this task seriously with their planned £1.9 billion funding gap.”\nRoyal Mail\nI recently met with Public Affairs team from the Royal Mail to discuss the decision to franchise the post offices in Stamford Hill, Stoke Newington, Finsbury Park and Dalston Kingsland.\nI expressed my strong concerns to them and have asked Royal Mail to ensure current services will not be lost.\nWe now need to feed into the consultation process and loudly saw we need to protect our services.\nStoke Newington Fire Station Visit and Opposing the Tory Cuts to Our Fire and Rescue Service\nI was pleased to recently visit Stoke Newington Fire Station on Church Street, one of the oldest in the borough, meeting with the brave fire fighters who have served our borough for many years.

Schools don’t need this and parents, communities, teachers and school leaders don’t want it and now we find that it’s going to cost over £1 billion, money which could be better spent driving up standards.”\nLabour’s four point plan to rescue the UK steel industry\nLabour announced this week our four point plan to stabilise the steel industry and provide security for steel workers.

We are the party that listens to you and makes Britain better. Let’s do that, together, in 2017.”\n* You can watch the video here\nIn her six months as Prime Minister Theresa May has shown no regard for the state of the NHS\nThis week saw warnings from Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, that seven day doctor services are unrealistic and from Dr. Mark Holland, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, that the NHS is facing potentially the worst January in its history. These are yet more warnings from health professionals of the impact that Tory cuts and neglect are having on one of our country’s most important institutions, and the scale of underfunding and understaffing.\nAs Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary put it, “Record levels of delayed discharges, the crisis in social care, postponing operations, cuts in the public health budgets have all stored up problems for the NHS, to the point where the leader of the national body for acute hospital staff is warning that this could be the worst January in the NHS’s history.\n“In her six months as Prime Minister Theresa May has shown no regard for the state of the NHS. The Tories have broken their promises on the NHS and their policies are failing our health service and patients. In 2017 the government simply must not carry on ignoring the warnings. Instead they need to come forward with a genuine plan to give the NHS and social care the resources they need to deliver the very best care every patient deserves.”\nTory cuts to Corporation Tax Damage Our Public Services\nNew analysis by the Labour Party, using official data, shows cuts in Corporation Tax under the Tories could have paid for much needed teachers, police officers and nurses.\nThe cost of Corporation Tax cuts worth almost £15 billion by 2021 is equivalent to the cost of employing 10,000 teachers, 10,000 police officers and 12,000 nurses, full-time, every year, for a decade.\nLabour is calling on the Government to reverse these deeply unfair tax giveaways and start properly investing in our vital public services.\nRequiring voters to produce specific forms of photo ID risks denying millions a vote\nOver the seasonal break, the Government announced plans to require voters to show proof of identification before casting their ballot.\nIn response, Cat Smith MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Voter Engagement and Youth Affairs, said: “Labour supports measures to tackle electoral fraud and will be backing a number of the reasonable proposals planned by the Government. However, requiring voters to produce specific forms of photo ID risks denying millions of electors a vote. “\nA year ago the Electoral Commission reported that 3.5 million electors - 7.5 percent of the electorate - would have no acceptable piece of photo ID. Under the Government’s proposals, these voters would either be denied a vote entirely, or in other trial areas, required to produce multiple pieces of ID, ‘one from group A, one from group B’.\nThe Homelessness Crisis and Labour’s Alternative\nNew figures show homelessness amongst vulnerable groups has risen dramatically in Tory Britain. Since the Tories came to power the number of families accepted by local authorities as homeless where a person in the household is vulnerable through mental illnesses has gone up by 53 per cent. Over the same period the number of households with dependent children accepted as homeless has increased by 62 per cent, and the number being classed as vulnerable through a member of the household having a physically disability has increased 49 per cent.\nSince 2010 homelessness has risen dramatically on all fronts with almost 60,000 households becoming homeless last year.\nAs a first plank of a new national rough sleeping strategy, a Labour government would double the number of homes ‘ring-fenced’ for people who have slept on the streets, renewing a housing scheme started by Conservative Peer and former Housing Minister Sir George Young for London in 1991.\nThe Clearing House scheme run by homelessness charity St Mungo’s on behalf of the Greater London Authority provides 3750 flats in more than 40 housing associations across London for people who have a history of rough sleeping.\nUnder Labour’s plan, 4,000 permanent new reserved flats or houses would be created, and the scheme extended beyond the capital. Labour is challenging the government to implement the proposal by striking an agreement with housing associations to make the accommodation available now, and provide funding for replacements.\nThe number of rough sleepers in England fell dramatically over Labour’s time in government due to a series of government initiatives, and there were only 464 rough sleepers recorded in 2009.\nSince 2010 the number of rough sleepers has doubled – with 3,569 people recorded in 2015 under a new annual measure introduced in 2010.\nWhile charities say these statistics do not come close to providing a comprehensive measure of the number of people sleeping rough, which is likely to be much higher than official figures, they do confirm the rapidly rising level of need.\nEU Nationals Have a Right to Remain Here\nLabour continues to demand that Theresa May give clarity to those EU citizens who were already here on 23 June and abandons her continuing refusal to guarantee that after Brexit the EU nationals who live in the UK will be able to remain. In particular, we have called on the government to pass a domestic law, dealing with the status of these individuals, which would get cross-party support, and could be passed very swiftly.\nI have recently written on why the Prime Minister needs to stop treating those already living and working here as bargaining chips, and you can read my piece for The New Statesman on the issue here\nback ⇢",

Coming, as it did, just before the Christmas recess it was a very poor present to Parliament.\nThe reason for the delay was clear. Ministers talk about a new, open, even global Britain after Brexit. Yet they have run a ceaseless propaganda campaign against migrants and migration. Ministers seem unaware that people and the labour they provide are the most important factor in producing goods and even more so in services. We are supposed to believe we can build a new, global Britain at the same time as erecting new hurdles to the skills, the experiences, the languages and the diversity that migrant workers can bring.\nThe Tories are split down the middle. As was vividly revealed yesterday. The Home secretary Sajid Javid questioned on the BBC refused to talk about the target of reducing immigration to the tens of thousands. But within hours of her Home Secretary’s radio interview the Prime Minister was still insisting on her commitment to the target. It seems some Tories, like the Prime Minister, want simply to campaign against migrant workers and migration. Others, like her Home Secretary, seem to want to do this and to meet the needs of our economy at the same time. The Prime Minister’s approach is pure dog whistle. Her Tory Party critics on this issue are no better. They simply want their cake and eat it.\nFurther, the Government is attempting to introduce an entirely new system of immigration before we have the slightest idea what our new relationship will be, or what even our Transition arrangements will be.\nSurely, this puts the cart before the horse? Our arrangements with the EU should be based on our economic needs, our prosperity and the needs of our public services. Our immigration policy should fit in with that. Instead, the Government intends that our immigration policy takes primacy, and all our future trading, security, and other co-operation with the EU fits in to that. This is the mess they are in, that they have led the country into.\nMinisters can’t agree on the £30,000 salary threshold and have now gone to “consultation”. What have they been doing these past months? A £30,000 limit is not a skills-based system at all, as the Home Secretary must know. It is a threshold which excludes trainee nurses, research scientists, speech therapists, as well as skilled construction workers, agricultural workers and many more.\nSome obvious questions arise. Will the new system mean a levelling down, so that migrants from the EU are treated to the same hostile environment as those from outside the EU? What is the impact assessment of the damage that will be done to our GDP and GDP per head? And who in the Home Office or Government will carry the can, when our prosperity is damaged by these illogical new rules, to go with the existing illogical ones?\nSome in the media like to suggest that Labour is not clear on Brexit. Or that it isn’t clear on the issue of immigration. Nothing could be further from the truth. Over the Summer I devoted three separate speeches to Labour’s new immigration policy.\nIf I summarise the key points here, they serve to clarify everything that remains wrong about this Government’s approach.\nLabour will honour all its existing legal and moral obligations to all non-EU migrants, the ‘Windrush Generation’. We will also honour the similar obligations we have made to the millions of EU citizens who have already made their homes here. This Government is committed to doing neither.\nWe have committed to put our economic needs and our public services first. Our negotiations with the EU are the priority. Instead, the Government puts is constant campaign against migrants first. It is important to note that the net migration target has never been legislation, and its absence here provides no reassurance at all. That target has never once been met. But it has not stopped Ministers from claiming this is the centre piece of their policy.\nWe have pledged to end indefinite detention, to close the abominable Yarl’s Wood and Brook House centres and to uphold the right to a family life. The Government commits to none of these.\nWe offer a genuine skills based immigration, to allow the recruitment of overseas workers to meet the skills and labour shortages we have in the public and private sectors, while increasing training and enforcing the minimum wage and other protections. The Government offers none of these. It is split over introducing an income-based system, and we have already seen employers up in arms over the dislocations this will cause.\nMinisters airily suggest they can determine the labour component of our economic needs, and for our public services. Its entire track record speaks to the contrary.\nWe have waited a long time for the Government’s immigration white paper. But it was not worth the wait. Once again, they have put bogus ‘clamp-downs’ on migration ahead of the real needs of our economy, prior to any settlement with the EU, against the interests of our public services, our research capacity, agriculture, and the very people we need to attract.\nIf this was a Christmas present, Parliament should be searching for the receipt and asking for its money back.\nback ⇢",

Crucially, his very first act as Secretary of State must be to come to Parliament on Monday to announce the full reversal of cruel Tory cuts that will see 370,000 disabled people lose £3,500 a year.”\nMeanwhile the Tories appear to be falling apart, with growing divisions on Europe and other aspects of George Osborne’s unfair budget (see below.)\nOpposing Osborne’s Unfair Budget\nThis Budget was a test for George Osborne. Could he meet his targets, could he deliver a fair Budget, could he invest to build an economy for the future? On all three counts he has failed. As Jeremy Corbyn said in his response this budget is a culmination of six years of Tory failure.\nOsborne’s Budget had unfairness at its very core. Tax cuts for the wealthy, paid for by those who can least afford it.\nUltimately Osborne has failed to balance the books, failed to invest in the economy and failed to improve the lives of working families across the country. Labour is standing up for a fairer economy that equips us for the future. The next Labour government will invest in a high skill, high wage economy that will provide a real future for the next generation.\nYou can watch Jeremy Corbyn respond to the budget here.\nGovernment Defeated on Trade Union Bill\nOn the evening of the Budget the government suffered a crushing defeat in the Lords over the Trade Union Bill. Labour Lords led the charge and voted by 320 to 172, a majority of 148, to defeat the government. This is the second time that our Lords have defeated the government on the Trade Union Bill.\nThe plans will now return to the House of Commons for further debate and Labour will continue to stand up for working people and oppose these attacks on our right to organise.\nInternational Development Matters – Yemen\nThis month we learned that British sales of arms to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen will be the subject of a full-scale inquiry in Parliament. The government is also facing a High Court challenge to examine whether its actions break British and EU arms export laws.\nThe British government has licensed £6.7 billion of arms to Saudi Arabia since David Cameron took office, including £2.8bn since the bombing of Yemen began in March 2015.\nThe cross-party committee conducting the inquiry is also likely to look at the role of the Department for International Development (DfID) in sanctioning arms sales. It has emerged that DfID was not consulted on the arms sales to Saudi Arabia, even though it has a major aid programme in Yemen.\nAdditionally, DfID itself is due to report before Easter on the broader aid implications of the government running an aid programme in Yemen while its arms sales help fuel civil war in that same country.\nOn the Labour side of the House of Commons, we are in no doubt that Britain’s arms trade with Saudi Arabia is undermining the humanitarian efforts of DfID, which gave £106 million in aid to Yemen in the past year.\nYou can read an article I’ve written on the issue for The Morning Star here\nInternational Development Matters- Tax Avoidance\nOn the eve of the budget, I wrote a Guardian piece on why Osborne must do more to crack down on tax havens – for poor nations’ sake, in which I explained that “the IMF calculates that every year around $200bn of untaxed income is taken out of poor countries by the international corporations operating on their territory.

These are some of the worst figures we have seen, with experts saying that standards are being pushed back fifteen years or more.\nThe BBC has also published leaked figures showing January’s A&E performance to be the worst since records started.\nIt’s making Theresa May’s utter disregard for the dire state of the NHS all the more disgraceful, and in this context, these are hollow words from Jeremy Hunt. On his watch the NHS is suffering from the biggest financial squeeze in history and social care is at tipping point.\nGovernment advisor Lord Carter has extraordinarily called NHS conditions ‘warlike’ and now Sir Robert Francis says there is an ‘existential crisis.’\nThe Government now need to listen to the experts and explain fully in the Budget in a few weeks time how they will put the NHS and social care on sustainable footing. As Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary said “The Prime Minister can’t just put her head in the sand and ignore these astounding warnings. This is clearly not just a 'small number of incidents’ as she glibly suggested.”\nThe Tories need to tackle the social care crisis\nIt was revealed last week that Surrey County Council is now not going to hold a referendum on 15 percent council tax rise to solve the shortage of funding for social care, with much speculation about the discussion they may have had with central Government.\nWhat we do know is there is an unprecedented crisis in social care, with care providers handing contracts back to councils, 1.2 million elderly people living without the care they need and delayed discharges causing huge pressure on the NHS.\nAcross the country, people are facing steep rises in their council tax bills, whilst the provision and quality of social care is declining. Council tax rises are nothing more than a short-term sticking plaster for a problem that needs long-term solutions. And they create a postcode lottery in social care, because they raise the least money in areas with the greatest need.\nAs Teresa Pearce, Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said “The Government should not be trying to deal with the national social care crisis through backroom deals with sympathetic Tory council leaders in an attempt to avoid negative publicity.”\nThe Government must come forward with a long-term strategic rethink of social care funding, as well as urgent funding to stem the crisis which is hurting elderly and disabled people right now.\nGovernment must show caution and concern about the way the Saudi campaign is being conducted\nThis week saw yet more revelations regarding arms exports to Saudi Arabia, following Boris Johnson giving a reassurance that the Saudi-led coalition was improving its targeting processes and ensuring that any incidents where non-military targets had been bombed were being properly investigated.\nAccording to the independent Yemen Data Project, in the 55 days between Boris Johnson writing his letter and the end of 2016, Saudi forces bombed 60 residential sites in Yemen, including houses, markets and refugee camps. At this time of heightening humanitarian crisis, they bombed 46 sites of economic infrastructure, including farms, water tanks and food trucks, and 48 sites of physical infrastructure, including roads, bridges and ports. They also managed to bomb three schools and a university. Not a single one of these 160 incidents has yet been investigated by the Saudi authorities.\nAs Emily Thornberry, Shadow Foreign Secretary, put it “If this is what Boris Johnson calls the Saudis ‘improving processes and…taking action to address failures’, then I would sorely hate to see the opposite.. It should not be left to the courts to rule whether the export licences for these arms sales should have been granted. It should be for this Government to show some long-overdue caution and concern about the way the Saudi campaign is being conducted, the devastating humanitarian crisis that campaign is helping to cause, and the blatant failure to ensure any proper, independent investigation of these alleged crimes against international law.”\nBy stopping the Dubs Scheme the Government is shutting the door on the most vulnerable\nGovernment statements last week regarding the ‘Dubs scheme’ for children refugees showed they are shutting the door on the most vulnerable, and wriggling out of the government’s obligation to accept child refugees.\nWe need to be clear that internationally agreed principles and the Dubs Amendment were never conceived as a “one-off.” For this reason, Labour cannot accept this decision. This seems to breach the spirit of the law passed with cross-party support. Accepting 350 unaccompanied child refugees is far short of the expected 3,000.\nThere will no doubt be legal challenges to this decision. This government is not above the law.\nThe Government should continue to commit to meeting their international treaty obligations and our own laws.\nLabour commits to meeting the obligations of the Dubs Amendment - we will restore the scheme and accept some of the most vulnerable children in the world.\nback ⇢",

It has no regard to the fair treatment of those citizens, or of securing the same rights for British citizens in the EU. That includes all those who live, work or study either in this country or in the EU, now and in the future. The new scheme obliges EU citizens (except Irish citizens) to apply for one of two types of status, settled or pre-settled. EU citizens, many of whom have lived and worked here for many years and may have children or spouses who were born here may be at risk of detention or deportation if their application is flawed, or if it is not processed in time.\nSo far, no EU member state has responded in kind. But there must be a risk that one or more will do so. The measures are not designed either to offer fair treatment to EU citizens who came here in good faith. And they are clearly not designed to foster good will, even though it is clearly in the interests of this country to do that.\nThe Windrush scandal gives us an insight into the gross inefficiencies that are all too prevalent in the immigration, and the wilful neglect of our own citizens’ rights which has been promoted by this government.\nThis was not, as Ministers often claim, a failure of paperwork. It is a shameful policy of treating our own citizens who were never previously asked for that paperwork, as if they are criminals. There is a clear risk that the Government’s idea of ‘fairness’ will be to treat EU citizens in something like the disgraceful way non-EU citizens have been treated in the ‘Windrush scandal’.\nThe deadline for the settlement applications is 30 June this year. The ordinary caseload of immigration officials already seems too great. Three-quarters of appeals against immigration decisions are already successful. Clearly, something is going very badly wrong if that is the case, especially when the vast majority of appeals are made without legal aid of any sort.\nUnder the government’s plans literally millions EU citizens will now have to have applications processed in a matter of months. On all known indicators, there can be little confidence that this deluge of applications will be processed correctly and on time. It is a recipe for chaos. The Immigration Minister seems unsure whether employers will be asked to monitor EU citizens’ status, and has provided wholly contradictory answers to this basic question. In truth, just like the Windrush victims, this government wants to use employers, landlords and pubic services as internal border guards.\nThis is all completely unnecessary. Our immigration system is already a mess. Yet the government is attempting a massive change to that system in advance of an unknown settlement with the EU on our whole future legal, trade, security and other arrangements with the EU. Immigration should follow, not lead this process.\nWorse, the entire scheme is misconceived. Any changes to the immigration system should come after the changes to our relationship with the EU. Our immigration system should fit into that, not the other way round.\nThe government’s approach is effectively to prepare a No Deal immigration system, to exclude EU citizens, place the onus on them to prove their right to be here and to threaten them with deportation if they fail. It is hard to imagine how this will preserve good-will with the EU member states. Given the role of those citizens in contributing to our society and our economy, this is also a huge act of self-harm.\nIt is wrong and should be stopped.\nback ⇢",

It makes it clear that in the years running up to this scandal there was no shortage of concern raised from many fronts, saying the distress suffered by many was “both predictable and forewarned,” and yet the government continued to prioritise it’s anti-immigrant ‘hostile environment’ approach.\nIn terms of difficulties being forewarned, it cites a 2014 report by the Legal Action Group, which flagged up the potential adverse impact of immigration policy on certain groups, including Jamaicans who arrived pre-1973, and that Caribbean ministers raised Windrush cases with the government at a 2016 forum, while inspection reports highlighted issues including the possibility people were being sanctioned because of incorrect data.\nShockingly, the report makes it clear that Home Office processes have not only led to wrongful detentions and deportations of members of the Windrush generation, but also that there was a failure in duty “to be proactive in identifying people affected.”\nIt also makes it clear that the full scale of the scandal has still not been established.\nKey findings include not only that up to four years ago the Home Office was aware about possible problems and “did not act on credible information about issues that may have contributed to the Windrush situation;” it ignored a 2016 recommendation to \"cleanse\" a database of individuals wrongly flagged as being here illegally; does not know now how many members of the Windrush generation have been wrongly affected by policies that were supposed to target illegal migrants and is showing \"a lack of curiosity\" about the effect on people not of Caribbean heritage.\nOn how these mistakes relate to broader government approaches to immigration, it criticises the use of deportation targets, saying “these targets would have influenced how enforcement staff carried out their work, in a way that may have increased the risk of wrongful removals.”\nThe report also outlines how the Home Office failed to protect the rights of the Windrush generation when it implemented its “hostile environment” approach, despite acknowledging in 2014 there were about 500,000 people who would find it harder to prove their status and would be negatively affected by new requirements to prove eligibility for services.\nThe report also shows us the scale of the scandal already revealed, and what may yet be revealed or indeed never found out.\nCurrently, the Home Office has reviewed the cases of 11,800 individuals from the Caribbean and identified 164 people removed or detained who might have been resident here before 1973.\nAdditionally, because there is no data to record those decisions, officials are unlikely to ever be able to establish how many victims of the scandal were incorrectly denied a job or a home to rent.\nWith regards to the charge that the government is showing \"a lack of curiosity\" about the effect on people not of Caribbean heritage, the report reveals that the government has no plans to review 160,000 files relating to non-Caribbean Commonwealth nationals to see who may also have been wrongfully detained or\nremoved.\nWhilst the Home Office has said it would be disproportionate to undertake this, the NAO understandably finds this approach “surprising” given there was an “onus on the department to use its own data to identify people affected.”\nIt is utterly wrong that the Government is trying to limit the Windrush scandal solely to victims from the Caribbean when it affects everyone who came here from the Commonwealth before 1973.\nIn terms of how we move forward, it is also quite unacceptable that the Home Office’s own practices continue to deepen the crisis, and a real change of approach is needed.\nWithin this context, ministers’ repeated assurances that they are on top of this scandal are clearly worthless.\nWe must all keep campaigning for justice for all the victims of this scandal, and ensure it doesn’t fall off the news agenda.\nThe Government urgently need to finally take charge of this shambles, start treating all the Windrush generation fairly and legally and end the hostile environment. Otherwise, this scandal will only continue, and more injustices and scandals will inevitably follow.\nback ⇢",

Apart from stealing the well being idea from Labour, they were part of the government that created every austerity measure, cutting benefits and our public services and causing large scale poverty and human suffering in our communities.”\nPeople haven’t forgotten the pain they inflicted on us and the lies they told last time they were in government, and neither have they forgotten about David Cameron’s record, saying he should have “ripped the plaster off” earlier in his premiership and introduced steeper cuts in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis\nAstonishingly this week David Cameron claimed that austerity should have gone further.\nAs John also said, “Cameron clearly has no idea of the scale of human suffering his austerity cuts inflicted on our communities. This confirms how cut off this privileged class of Tories are from the everyday lives of our people.”\nInternational students treated abominably by the Tories\nA report from the Public Accounts Committee has said that the Home Office “rushed to penalise” international students accused of cheating in the English language test scandal without checking the reliability of the evidence. It also says that revoking visas before verifying evidence led to “injustice and hardship for many thousands of international students”.\nAs I have said before, these international students have been treated abominably. Some used their whole families’ savings to pay to study here, and were then deported on faulty evidence.\nLabour welcomes international students here and the contribution they make. They are owed an apology by this government. Until the Tories’ whole ‘hostile environment’ is ended, similar scandals will recur.\nBoris Johnson must apologise for shameful comments about child abuse\nI issued a Press Release in my capacity as Shadow Home Secretary this week in response to Boris Johnson denying comments he made regarding investigations into historic child abuse cases, in which I said “Boris Johnson’s original comments were so shameful and hurtful to the victims of historic child abuse that it is no wonder he now wants to deny he ever said them.”\n“The Prime Minister must apologise, sincerely and profusely, for the harm his disgusting comments caused, and now for lying to the people about it.”\nAs has been widely reported, in March this year, Boris Johnson said “£60m I saw was being spaffed up the wall on some investigation into historic child abuse.” Yet this week, Boris Johnson denied saying it.\nPriti Patel’s suggestion that we could maintain access to all our security arrangements if we crash out of the EU is simply not plausible\nHome Secretary Priti Patel claimed on Marr last week the UK could stay part of all international security agreements in the event of a no deal Brexit.\nThe Home Secretary seems deeply confused about the UK’s security arrangements in the event of a no deal, and needs to clarify the situation urgently.\nThe reality is that her suggestion that we could maintain access to all our security arrangements if we crash out of the EU is simply not plausible.\nBoris Johnson is happy for us to stop cooperating fully with our neighbours on security. Not only will we lose access to real-time information about security threats if we crash out of the EU, but we may also have to destroy some of the data we already have.\nThis is why Labour has led efforts to get No Deal off the table. This government would knowingly compromise the safety of its citizens – it has no business running our country.\n‘String of high-profile failures’ in outsourcing – Labour will end this racket\nAn Institute for Government report this week analysed ‘a string of high-profile failures’ in outsourcing. The ‘string of high-profile failures’ discussed in this report are not just one-offs – they reflect a broken model for delivering public services, which prioritises profit over people.\nThe report notes that “a string of high-profile failures has put Britain’s outsourcing model under intense scrutiny.” It says that, despite claims that outsourcing achieves 20%-30% in cost savings, “we found little evidence that such savings are available today, whether for services outsourced for the first time or on second- or third-generation contracts.”\nIt’s becoming clearer by the day that we’re at a crossroads on outsourcing, as the Institute for Government says, and it’s staggering to look back at the last 40 years of this failed experiment and see so little strong evidence that it works.\nOnly Labour will end this racket and make sure our public services are run in the interests of the many, not to enrich a privileged few.\n3/4 of UK universities are very or extremely concerned about the impact of No Deal\nA Universities UK report this week showed that three quarters of surveyed UK universities are ‘very’ or ‘extremely concerned’ about the negative impact a No Deal.\nAs Angela Rayner MP, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said “Boris Johnson’s reckless No Deal Brexit would be disastrous for our universities.”\nNearly one in five university academics are EU nationals and they all face uncertainty and anxiety about their future. A chaotic and damaging No Deal Brexit will also have a devastating impact on the ability of our universities to recruit students from EU countries and access research funding.\nYet the new Education Secretary has been unable to give universities even the most basic reassurance that he has any credible plan.\nThat is why Labour will continue to take all necessary steps to stop Boris Johnson forcing us into a No Deal Brexit that no one voted for.\nGovernment’s Prevent review far from independent\nThe government has now published its terms of reference for its review into Prevent.\nThe reality is that this review will also be far from independent, as it relies on Home Office support, while the reviewer has previously stated his strong support for Prevent.\nAs I said in my Press Release on the matter, “This is a strange review. You cannot possibly analyse something without looking at the evidence of how it has operated in the past. And the fact that this crucial information being ignored tells us the government already accepts Prevent has been an abject failure.”\nback ⇢",

But now, we find from a ministerial statement timed to avoid news coverage that this is not the policy after all.\nIn fact, the government will not be ending freedom of\nmovement for at least 3 years. EU citizens who come here after the Brexit date\nwill be able enjoy freedom of movement rights for 36 months. This will apply to\nanyone who comes here before the end of 2020.\nThe Tories were simply unable to deliver on their\nreactionary promise. They did not care about the terrible impact that\nabolishing freedom of movement will have on recruiting to our public services,\nespecially the NHS, as well as the effects on our businesses and our\nuniversities. After all, this is the Prime Minister who famously said, “F**k\nbusiness”.\nBut they did have to take account of the law. And there is no law which has been passed by parliament to remove freedom of movement. Unless and until that happens – and Labour and other opposition parties have voted repeatedly against the Tories’ Immigration Bill – the current law stands, which is to allow EU citizens their treaty rights of freedom of movement.\nThe Tories never had anything in place that would supersede those rights, either legally or practically. And the practical effect of removing these rights is not just devastating to the many people involved, but is a gigantic act of self-harm. As my colleague John McDonnell said in another context, this government offers a unique combination of right wing extremism and bumbling incompetence.\nWe should be clear that we have all benefited from freedom of movement. It has helped to recruit to our chronically understaffed NHS and other public services, and workers with all types of skills have contributed to our economy as well as to our cultural and social life. The public finances have been boosted. It is often forgotten too that some immigrants themselves create jobs by establishing or expanding businesses.\nWhat is certain is that we should do nothing which makes us\nworse off. Clearly, that means opposing No Deal Brexit. But it also means\nhonouring the commitments we have already mad to all the EU citizens who have\ncome here. And not making any changes to our immigration system that will make\nthem or us worse off.\nThis is not the approach of this government. It will\ncontinue to make false, unworkable promises on curbing immigration. The aim is not to deliver on the promises,\nany more than the promise to cut net migration to under 100,000 annually has\never been met. It is instead to permanently rail against foreigners and\nmigrants.\nWe are told that the government intends to run a grotesque\nracist, xenophobic election campaign, which they insultingly call a ‘northern\nstrategy’, as if all northerners share the Tories’ racism.\nThey don’t. We will fight this obvious scapegoating, trying to avoid responsibility for a crisis of the Tories’ own making. And we will win, by matching unity and prosperity against division and racism.\nWe need a government that rejects this ugly division. We need a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn.\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-immigration-policy-freedom-movement-conservatives-priti-patel-a9094126.html\nback ⇢",
  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_articles_item1713/content_57.html": "Why We Need Our Ticket Offices\nAfter weeks of speculation, rail firms backed by the government, have announced plans to close almost 1000 ticket offices up and down the country. These closures represent yet another attempt to slash jobs on the railways in pursuit of ever greater profits.\nClearly the governments vision for the railways of the future will be one that is completely automated. No doubt ministers dream of days when everything from ticketing to the driving of the trains themselves can all be done by computers. The problem is that this dream is just that. As has been pointed out ad nauseum by the railway unions and industry experts, automating existing train services is impossible without extraordinary central government investment in infrastructure.\nEven automating ticketing is not as easy as it seems. For many travellers, contactless or online booking has reduced their reliance on ticketing offices. But 1 in 8 are still paid for at ticket offices. Estimates suggest that over 110 million train journeys were made possible by train station ticket offices and the reasons why are varied. Station staff are essential when automatic ticket barriers fail, for travel advice when an expert opinion is required, to support elderly passengers who might otherwise be digitally excluded, supporting vulnerable passengers in need of protection, supporting young children who may have become separated from their parents - the list goes on and on.\nAmong the most callous aspects of closing these ticket offices would be the casual disregard for the needs of disabled passengers. Ticket offices are a vital first point of contact, staffed by people who can support a huge range of needs in the flexible and resourceful way that is natural to an experienced person, but impossible to an automated machine system. Ticket staff support disabled passengers in everything from buying tickets (23% of disabled passengers do not use the internet) to using station facilities and boarding or disembarking from a train.\nThe wide scope of disabled people who will suffer from the closure of ticket offices is perhaps most easily seen in the huge array of disability charities who are opposed to this move. Transport for All, which runs the #NotJustTheTicket campaign, is backed by over a dozen charities supporting deaf people, people with visual impairment or blindness and other disabled people in opposing these closures.\nRather than fixating on how many jobs the government can axe, ministers could turn their attention to other more pressing issues on the railways. They could spend their time ending 30 years of failed railway privatisation that has led to crumbling infrastructure, sky high fares subsidised by the taxpayer and repeated public bailouts. They could replace outdated infrastructure like ancient signalling systems, uncomfortable and poorly air-conditioned trains, achieve full railway electrification and refurbish stations to increase capacity and ensure wheelchair accessibility across the UK rail network. In my own constituency, a key railway station (Dalston Kingsland) with 3.5 million entries and exits in 2021-2022, has no step-free access, forcing disabled travellers to use alternative routes.\nThe government's attack on ticket offices is a double tragedy, cutting existing support while failing to build the railways Britain deserves. It's one we must resist.\nback ⇢",

It must not be allowed to divide us, to change who we are or to erode our democracy.\nUnited together, we can always defeat those who threaten us – in contrast, demonising whole communities, as some on the far-right have sought to do, will not make us any safer in these difficult times.\nBy standing in unity since the attack Londoners have defied the hatred of the terrorists and those who would seek to divide us.\nGreater restrictions and rationing are a direct result of Tory underfunding of the NHS\nThis week saw reports that NHS England is to develop new guidelines in order to stop GPs from prescribing certain medicines.\nAs Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth put it, “We have long warned this underfunding would lead to greater rationing of services and treatments. Ministers need to explain what [the] restrictions will mean for those eligible for free prescriptions such as the elderly, pregnant and those on low incomes. Of course, NHS bosses are right to demand the best possible value for money from the medicines they buy so that every penny can go towards patient care. But let’s be clear: the greater restrictions and rationing proposed today are a direct result of Theresa May’s underfunding of the NHS.“\nWe need to be clear that this Government has forced the NHS through the longest period of financial squeeze in its history, with hospital bosses recently warning it will be ‘mission impossible’ to achieve the standards of care the public demand given the scale of the underfunding.\nHolding the Tories to Account on Brexit\nThis week, the Prime Minister will inform the European council that the UK intends to leave the EU.\nOn Monday, Shadow Minister for Brexit Keir Starmer set out six key tests for any final Brexit deal. They cover the impact of Brexit on our future relationship with the EU, our economy, national security, fundamental rights, immigration and the distribution of power and opportunity across the country.\nThey are the yardstick by which Labour will hold the prime minister to account throughout negotiations and how we will judge the final deal she returns with.\nUKIP loses Its only MP Douglas Carswell\nCommenting on Douglas Carswell’s decision to leave UKIP this weekend, Labour’s Shadow Minister and Elections Chair, Andrew Gwynne MP, said: “UKIP are tearing themselves apart. Their only MP has quit,= their biggest donor has fled and their leader was utterly rejected by the voters of Stoke-on-Trent a few weeks ago. Under Paul Nuttall UKIP now has no MPs and no future.”\nThis episode exposes the truth of UKIP: they’ve got nothing to offer the voters and they’re a divided party with extreme policies, such as privatising the NHS.\nIt is crucial that there is effective judicial oversight of the security services’ access to encrypted messages\nIn response to the controversy over encrypted messages in the wake of the terrorist attack at Westminster, Labour opposes an open access trawl of all messaging. Good counter-terrorism measures are nearly always intelligence-led.\nIn the cases of suspects or perpetrators of serious crime or terrorism, it is crucial that there is effective judicial oversight of the security services’ access to encrypted messages.\nFighting terrorism is a serious business, and should not be used for political grandstanding.\nback ⇢",

It should have been obvious that they would need to consult first, or at least wait until after their review on self-employment had finished, before announcing such drastic changes.\nAdditionally, this week we have also seen analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) that shows real wages will be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007.\nAs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP put it, “this lost decade for living standards is a damning indictment of seven years of Tory economicfailure.”\nTheresa May’s sustained underfunding of the NHS is directly impacting on the quality of patient care and the NHS performance statistics\nThe release of a King’s Fund report on understanding NHS financial pressures this week has shown that the Tories’ sustained underfunding of the NHS is directly impacting on the quality of patient care. We all know we have an ageing population and rising demands on the NHS yet Tory ministers have completely failed to put in place the plans for the NHS to respond to those demands.\nAs Shadow Health Minister Jonathan Ashworth put it, “The King’s Fund say that district nurses are under increasing pressure, which is affecting both their welfare and patient care. The Government’s decision to make savings by cutting back preventative healthcare and public health services is staggeringly short sighted and will end up costing the NHS and the country far more in the long term.”\nMeanwhile, the latest NHS performance statistics show an unprecedented winter crisis, in which almost a thousand people waited over twelve hours on trolleys, compared to just 17 in January 2011. The Government once again missed its four hour A&E target and seems content with a 504 per cent increase in the number of patients waiting over four hours for admission since January 2011.\nLast week’s Budget announcement should have been an opportunity to genuinely place the NHS on a sustainable footing. And yet the Chancellor’s mere offer of £100 million for capital funding simply isn’t enough, meaning the NHS will continue facing its biggest financial squeeze in history and head-for-head investment will fall again next year.\nMore evidence of the Tories secret deal with the leadership of Surrey County Council\nThe release of FOI letters by Surrey County Council this week showed that despite Theresa May’s claims to the contrary, there is more evidence of the Tories secret deal with the leadership of Surrey County Council.\nWhat makes this even worse is that the Government keeps on squeezing local councils’ funding to unbearable levels. For example, we are seeing a reduction of £139 million in the government’s annual grants to Hackney – a cut of 45 per cent – in the period 2010/11 to 2020/21.\nAdditionally, there is a huge crisis in social care and what we need from the Tories is a long term sustainable plan, rather than sweetheart deals for Tory councils.\nIt is time for the Government to come clean. We need full disclosure of the terms of the deal and reassurance that all councils will be treated the same way not just the lucky few the Tories favour.\nThe growing national housing crisis is entrenched and endemic in London but the Tories have no answers\nResearch from the Trust for London charity this week was a timely eminder that the growing national housing crisis is entrenched and endemic in London, and that the Government is doing next to nothing to\nresolve it.\nFor those on the London Living Wage of £9.75 an hour, the only type of housing that is affordable in London is housing association or council rented property but both are under attack from right-to-buy and forced sale schemes.\nIn contrast to the Tories, the Mayor of London is showing the way by insisting on high levels of shared ownership, London Living Rent and enuinely affordable social rented homes in new developments.\nBut, as Shadow Minister for London Andy Slaughter MP put it this week, “to get the volume and type of housing that Londoners can afford to rent or buy requires major initiative by central Government, not the vacuum in policy revealed in the recent White Paper.”\nLabour supports the demand for Orgreave justice\nI was pleased to speak alongside Richard Burgon MP and others at a protest outside the Home Office on Monday supporting the demand for justice for the striking miners at Orgreave and their families.\nThe truth must be told. But the Tories are refusing to hold a proper Inquiry. The Government is stonewalling despite previously indicating that a full Inquiry was on offer.\nback ⇢",

Of course, it’s highly regrettable we lost any seats, but our 84 losses were completely dwarfed by the Tory wipe-out of over 1,300 losses. They were routed and Labour would be the largest party in a general election, based on these votes.\nhttps://twitter.com/hzeffman/status/1124342323477929985\nAs far as the possibility of a general election is concerned, we would say bring it on! When we went into the 2017 general election, the polls had us 20 points behind. We made up those 20 points in the course of that election because we get more fair and balanced coverage under law. We are definitely not frightened of a general election, we believe we can win.\nThe key issue and what we were picking up on the doorstep was Brexit. A dominant national is unusual in local elections and sadly people were blaming the political class as a whole for the impasse of Brexit.\nPreviously, the Lib Dems were decimated because of their involvement in the Tory coalition for austerity. They’ve now come full circle as a receptacle for a protest vote. But we have seen these Lib Dem surges in local elections before and they don’t usually translate into real gains in a general election.\nThere is too a strange claim from the anti-Corbyn press about lack of clarity on Brexit. It is even echoed inside the Labour Party. Yet we have been clear that what we really want is a general election, there’s nothing in these results to get us to swerve from that.\nIn the event that we are unable to force a general election, we are prepared to look at the circumstances in which a second referendum would be a way out of the current deadlock. But there is an important point that we have a more challenging position than either the Conservatives or Lib Dems. We represent some of the strongest pro remain areas, like my own constituency of Hackney North, but we also have some of the strongest leave areas like some of those constituencies in the North and the Midlands and what we are seeking to do as a party is to hold the whole country together. It is easy for some people to jeer, but when this whole Brexit debate is over, there will be a country to bring together. It is deeply troubling that Theresa May never mentions the 48% of people that voted remain, equally the Lib Dems never mention the 52% that voted to leave and why they wanted to leave. But what we have sought to do is difficult, and you get jeered at by journalists and others who are deeply hostile to a Corbyn-led government, is try and hold the country together.”\nIt is regrettable that some colleagues fail to understand our position but we’ve set it out over and over and it reflects the unanimous position of the party at conference. By no means do we rule out a second referendum. But we’re not a ‘second referendum in any circumstances’ party. We are a party that wants what is best for the country. It’s easy if all you’re going to do is talk to leave voters, It’s easy if all you’re going to do is talk to remain voters – but for a national party seeking government, we have to hold people, the country and our the party together.\nThis is actually a more courageous and principled stance than those who want to speak to only one set of voters. Jeremy Corbyn has gone into some of the strongest leave voting areas in the country and said to them, that if you are struggling, if you are unemployed, if you have concerns for your children’s future, your issues are the same in leave areas as they are in remain areas. We have not done what the Tories have done which is try and scapegoat migrants for this crisis. We have shown courage and we have shown principles and will continue to do so.\nThe deal that Theresa May is currently offering is not a good deal. We have repeatedly voted against it. And the Tories have not moved from their original red lines and the deal that they insist on is not in the interests of the country, of jobs, or wages, or the NHS.\nI have never seen the Conservative party in such a state as this. The last time there was anything similar was when they were getting rid of Mrs Thatcher. Their party is now a shambles, a collection of factions, schemers and plotters. They do not have the votes in parliament for any deal which Theresa May could conceivably bring forward. We will argue for our vision, of a customs union and a close relationship with the Single Market. If we cannot achieve these, increasingly, it seems the only way out of the current impasse is either a general election or a second referendum.\nPublished: The Independent\nback ⇢",

Despite all this time having passed since Grenfell, not one person has been held personally accountable, let alone criminally liable for the negligence that allowed such a devastating fire. Many survivors of the fire continue to live uprooted lives, dealing with the trauma of losing loved ones and with some having faced additional housing insecurity after the fire.\nBut the fall-out from Grenfell has extended far beyond the residents of Grenfell tower. In the wake of the fire, it was discovered that the building’s cladding, that had been added during refurbishment carried out between 2012 and 2016 was extremely flammable. The buildings original fire safety system, which centred on containing any fire to the flat that it originated from, was undone by the cladding that wrapped around the building, making a path for the fire to spread. Since then, flammable cladding has been discovered on buildings up and down the country, plunging homeowners into uncertainty and disrupting everyone from new families looking to move into a bigger home to the recently bereaved, trying to execute a will.\nThe campaign for justice for the Grenfell survivors goes on, and the need to learn the lessons has never been more urgent. In recent years we have seen other major fires, like the recent fires in Shadwell, which highlighted how overcrowding and some dangerous e-scooters are increasing the risk and deadliness of fire. The deadly Lakanal House fire of 2009, which preceded Grenfell, took the lives of three adults and three young children, one aged just 20 days. An Inquest into the Lakanal House fire found that deaths from this fire could have been prevented with proper fire safety checks.\nIf we truly want to honour the memories of those lost at Grenfell, as well as those who have died at Shadwell and Lakanal House, we need action. The Grenfell survivors have waited too long for Justice, and developers need to stop shirking responsibility and risking lives in pursuit of a quick buck. Michael Gove is right to put pressure on cladding companies and developers. His threat to ban recalcitrant developers who refuse to cooperate with the cladding removal scheme from building new homes is a good start, but it’s a threat the government must be willing to stick to and represents only the first step of what is needed. It’s also action that had to be dragged out of the government after years of tireless campaigning by Grenfell survivors and reflects only a small part of what is needed. Four of the twelve recommendations from Phase 1 of the Grenfell Inquiry are yet to be implemented, including the key recommendation of personal emergency evacuation plans for disabled residents. Instituting tougher standards on fire safety, tackling overcrowding in housing, reversing the disastrous cuts to the Fire Service, installation of sprinkler and other fire systems and prosecuting those responsible.\nWe need this and so much more to even begin to honour the memory of the victims of Grenfell and to ensure it never happens again.\nback ⇢",

It was recently revealed that, one year after the government recognised its “appalling” mistake in classifying thousands of legal UK residents as illegal immigrants, only 13 Windrush victims had been granted emergency financial support by the government by the end of April.\nThe very real effects of the Windrush scandal on people’s lives meant that many of those affected were pushed into poverty because of the combined effect of being forced out of their jobs and being told they were ineligible for benefits and healthcare that they were of course fully entitled to.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that lives have been destroyed.The Windrush scandal exposed a moral failure at the heart of this rotten government, and ever since it has failed repeatedly to put this grave injustice right.\nThe Home Secretary told the House of Commons last year that the government would “do whatever it takes to put it right” when it came to Windrush, yet the reality is that the Tories have been extraordinarily lax in carrying out their repeated verbal commitments to find out who are the victims of this scandal and what will be done to correct it.\nIn the aforementioned recent example of this, while the government finally agreed to launch a hardship fund at the end of last year, by the end of April only 91 people had applied for help and only 13 had received support, with 41 being rejected outright.\nThe scheme simply isn’t fit for purpose.The government has failed the Windrush generation, it has failed in its duty to protect its own citizens. As I said in the House of Commons, the government has to begin to acknowledge communities’ grave concerns about how it has failed when it comes to compensating victims of the Windrush scandal. Community voices up and down the country are clear in saying that it is not working.\nMy fellow Labour MP Helen Hayes is one of many who have heard this in their own constituency, and has eloquently explained why. She said last week that community groups in her constituency had described problems with the compensation scheme, pointing out that “the form is too complex, advice is neither accessible nor specialist enough, and the burden of proof is far too high,” adding that the government must “provide immediate funding for specialist legal advice to be available not just by phone but in person for every Windrush citizen who needs it.”\nYet the government refuses to understand that the compensation scheme simply isn’t working. It is also a matter of urgency that the government reconsiders some of the worst aspects of the current scheme, which are an insult to the victims.\nOne clear example of this is that it will currently not compensate those who may have been wrongly deported, with the relevant document saying “it is difficult to determine whether inability to return to the UK is a loss.” This position is ridiculous. Clearly someone being deprived of their home, job, family and community is a loss. When we look at all these developments, and continue the fight for justice, it’s important to remember that the Windrush scandal is a product of the government’s failed “hostile environment” approach to immigration, and that this whole approach needs to change if something like this isn’t to happen again.\nThe “hostile environment” approach is based on treating people as if they were illegal immigrants and shifting the burden of proof of to them to prove otherwise. Specifically, when it came to the Windrush scandal, many elderly victims were unable to produce what was deemed the necessary documentation.\nMillions of people, here in Britain, in the Commonwealth and around the world, have been appalled at the treatment of the Windrush victims, and yet the Windrush scandal continues to rumble on, over one year on.\nIt is clear that the Tories simply cannot be trusted. Again and again, the government has failed the Windrush generation, it has failed in its duty to protect its own citizens, failed to properly examine how it created this scandal and continues to fail to address properly and openly the effects of that scandal.\nWe must keep up the pressure for justice for the victims of the Windrush. It is also time for the government to end the hostile environment for good. Unless and until it does, the reek of the Windrush scandal will forever be associated with this rotten government.\nIn contrast to the Tories, Labour will ensure that the Windrush generation gets the justice they deserve. And in government, we will end the Tories’ hostile environment to prevent these injustices being repeated.\nback ⇢",

You can read the full letter and a report here.\nA Welcome U-Turn on Disability Cuts But Still an Unfair Budget\nGeorge Osborne's Budget was built on failure with unfairness at its very core. He proposed the slashing of Personal Independence Payments, which would have seen hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities left on average £3,500 a year worse off. That’s £3,500 that would have been spent on getting support going to the toilet, getting dressed and leaving the house.\nBut thanks to our collective pressure, Osborne announced a U-turn on the cuts within a mere matter of days.\nHowever, the Tories still remain committed to their failed - and ideologically-driven - austerity. As Jeremy Corbyn pointed out at Prime Ministers' Questions, no mainstream economic experts back further austerity and austerity has meant that forecasts for growth, wage-growth and investment were down in last week's budget.\nFurthermore, we’ve had no answer on how the Tories plan to fill the £4.4 billion black hole left by their forced u-turn on disability benefits. Given a record of unfairness which saw them raise VAT after promising they had ‘no plans’ to do so, millions of people will be worrying about where the axe will fall and who is going to be left to pick up the bill for George Osborne’s mess.\nWith only vague promises of “no plans” to make further welfare cuts, we must continue to fight for an economy where prosperity is shared by all.\nRise in homelessness further blow to Cameron’s ‘compassionate Conservatism’\nJeremy Corbyn took David Cameron to task at PMQs this week in response to to new government data revealing that homelessness has risen by a third since 2010 and the number of disabled people made homeless has increased by 39 per cent.\nAs John Healey MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Housing and Planning, said “Hard on the heels of the Budget backtrack on disability benefits, this huge rise in homelessness is a further blow to the credibility of David Cameron’s claim to ‘compassionate Conservatism’. \"\nThese figures are just the tip of the iceberg of the housing crisis but they are a condemnation of Conservative housing policy and the harsh impact it is having on those who are most vulnerable.\nIt is clear that the Government’s failure to control housing costs and crude cuts to housing support over the last six years are making the problem much worse.

Until the pay, status and prospects for progression in these sectors improve, the gender pay gap will not be eliminated.

Philip Hammond has to answer how, if he wants to further slash corporation tax rates, our country fund our NHS and social care that are in crisis after six years of Tory Austerity.\nDespite the Prime Minister’s pretence at having a plan, the truth is that she is making it up as she goes along.\nLabour is demanding a plan from the Government to ensure it is accountable to Parliament throughout the negotiations and a meaningful vote on the final deal the Government proposes.\nCrime figures confirm Theresa May’s record as Home Secretary as one of failure\nCrime figures released last week confirmed Theresa May’s record as Home Secretary as one of failure.\nInstead of preparing the police for crime in the 21st century, the Tories slashed their budgets by a quarter, with the loss of over 19,000 police officers and 6,000 community support officers.\nNow further deep cuts in funding threaten even more losses to frontline officer numbers, just as we are beginning to see the true scale of crime.\nAs I said in my press release as Shadow Home Secretary, “Working people deserve better than Tory failure – only Labour will stand up for safer communities and for the victims of crime.”\nNHS crisis is one that’s been made in Downing Street\nTheresa May needs to wake up to the crisis in our NHS– that was the clear message from Labour campaigning here in Hackney North and Stoke Newington on Saturday, and our members on the streets and doorsteps across the country as part of Labour’s national campaign day.\nDay after day experts and health professionals calling for the Government to take action, and more statistics showing how the crisis is deepening.\nThe latest NHS weekly performance data shows that there were 52 temporary diverts from one A&E to another in the week ending 15 January 2017.

Council tax will not plug the growing funding gap in the long-term, and it will create a postcode lottery in services, leaving the poorest councils struggling to get by.\nRefugees – The Government needs to live up to its moral and legal obligation to help people fleeing persecution and war\nThere were numerous reports this week that plans by councils to settle refugees have stalled without Government resources.\nMany councils across the country are willing to step up and take their share of refugees.

Some have been helped (by mental health services) but many have not.”\nShe added that “the type of trauma we have does not go away. There have been several suicides and while it is often difficult to ascertain causes, the people that I know of, five, who have lost their lives in the past seven months were affected to varying degrees by what happened.\"\nTo give another example, in March, independent research found cancer-causing chemicals and other potentially harmful toxins close to Grenfell Tower in fire debris and soil samples, with the research finding “significant environmental contamination” from a range of toxins, including in oily deposits collected 17 months after the tragedy from a flat 160 metres from the site.\nAnd, as has been widely reported, many survivors haven’t been properly rehomed, and the government has consistently failed to meet its own deadlines in this regard.\nTwo years on from the tragedy it is therefore unfortunately clear that not only has not enough been to secure justice for the community, but also that many lessons have not been learnt in terms of the danger of another Grenfell occurring.\nOn the latter point, earlier this week, it was revealed that almost 60,000 people are still living in tower blocks covered in the highly flammable material that was used on Grenfell Tower.\nSpecifically, there are 24,800 homes in high-rise blocks that are still covered in Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) cladding. This incorporates about 16,400 homes in privately-owned buildings and 8,400 in the social housing sector.\nACM panels were widely blamed as one cause of the rapid spread of the fire at Grenfell and have since been banned by the government.\nDespite this, more than eight in 10 yet to have the cladding taken down – a figure that rises to more than nine in 10 for privately-owned blocks.\nAn urgent deadline for the removal of this cladding must now be set.\nIn addition to this, many more may people may be unknowingly be living in dangerous buildings covered in ‘non-ACM’ flammable materials, as the Government has still not properly tested suspect cladding of this type.\nWhilst the government began testing non-ACM cladding last month, it has faced criticism for opting for a less comprehensive type of test than the one that was applied to ACM panels after the Grenfell fire.\nWith regards to this, ministers should now agree to fund the removal of other types of cladding that could be just as flammable.\nFurthermore, in terms of the risk of the tragedy being repeated, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) recently argued that that “the government has done nothing to adequately prepare fire and rescue services for a similar incident,“ with General Secretary Matt Wrack saying that “two years on, the government still has not provided the planning and resources necessary to prepare firefighters for what are now completely foreseeable risks.”\nIn particular, the FBU has drawn attention to new evidence that reveals a postcode lottery of preparedness across the country, with some fire services planning to send as few as two fire engines to a high-rise fire.\nThis is deeply worrying - there is no reason why which part of the country a building is located in should determine the safety of its resident.\nWhilst 40 fire engines were sent to Grenfell Tower on the night of the fire, the data collected by the FBU reveals that resources outside of London are so stretched that fire and rescue services would not be able to mobilise anywhere near that scale.\nFinally, whilst the government seems incapable of understanding this simple reality, in the area of our fire and rescue service, as in other areas, it is important to understand that cuts have consequences, especially for public safety.\nFBU research shows that cuts to fire and rescue services have continued after Grenfell, despite calls from the FBU to halt austerity measures in the wake of the tragedy. English fire funds from central government have been cut by another 15% from 2016/17 to 2019/20.\nNearly 12,000 firefighters have been axed since 2010 meaning that one-in-five firefighter jobs have been cut.\nResponse times to emergencies are getting longer (with fewer firefighters at the early stages of incidents), greater risk to the public and fires deaths are creeping back up.\nCuts have also impacted on the number of fire safety inspections fire services undertake. Home fire safety checks have fallen by 25%. The number of fire safety inspectors has fallen by 28%.\nThese funding cuts must stop, the government must set a deadline for the removal of all dangerous cladding, and those effected by the Grenfell catastrophe must have justice.\nback ⇢",

You really can’t trust the Tories to tackle it.\n“We need to follow the evidence, which is that a public health approach is desperately needed to ensure we are steering vulnerable young people away from knife crime.”\nback ⇢",

Over the last six years, they have systematically failed the majority of people and they have no plan to change course on the key issues that matter.\nUnder the Tories those at the top have been given tax breaks while everyone else suffers, working people have had vital support cut and our NHS, local government services and others are being run into the ground.\nYou can read my recent column in response to Theresa May’s speech here.\nNHS Crisis - Theresa May needs to take responsibility\nFirst, government Ministers blamed patients for the deepening crisis in our NHS, then Theresa May blamed the NHS England Boss Simon Stevens and now she is blaming family doctors.\nAs our Shadow Health Minister Jonathan Ashworth put it, “Instead she tries to tell the British people that the NHS crisis is nothing more than just a ‘small number of incidents where unacceptable practises have taken place’. Patients, their families and hardworking over stretched NHS staff will be shocked at the Prime Minister’s casual dismissal of the realities of what’s happening on the ground.”\nTheresa May has supported £4.6 billion of cuts to social care, refused to offer any help for social care in the Autumn Statement and even stubbornly dismissed pleas to bring forward £700 million of social care cash.\nFurthermore, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed out this weekend the Tories ideologically-driven obsession with privatisation further hits the NHS, where private provision has more than doubled since 2010.\nAs Jeremy put it, “Privatisation fails our most valued national institution: the NHS. It saddles us with an expensive and unnecessary internal market. It puts tax avoidance, not patient care, at the heart of its management. It also promotes excessive boardroom pay and grotesque inequality.”\nTheresa May’s response to this crisis has been dismissive, incompetent and floundering. Patients deserve better.\nPlease join our local campaign actions on Labour’s NHS national campaign day this Saturday (January 21) at 47-49 Stamford Hill (full details here,) Dalston Kingsland Overground Station (see here,) and outside the Farmers Market on Stoke Newington High Street (see here.)\nThe Tories Are Failing Victims Of Crime\nThe Tory government is breaking one of its key manifesto pledges and is completely failing to increase support for victims of crime. Parliament is currently deliberating the Policing and Crime Bill - colleagues in both the Lords and the Commons have put forward a series of amendments which would increase the rights of victims and make the public sector more responsive to their needs. The government rejected them all.\nRead my piece for the Huffington Post on the Bill here.\nback ⇢",
  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_parliamentary-report_item1360/content_90.html": "NEWS THIS WEEK – from Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North & Stoke Newington\n01 Mar 2017\nThe NHS lost letters scandalFollowing the statement in the House of Commons by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt about the 700,000 patient letters lost by NHS Shared Business Services on Monday, Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, has written to Jeremy Hunt to demand further assurances for the public.\nThis whole episode is an absolute scandal. For a company partly owned by the Department of Health and a private company to fail to deliver over half a million NHS letters, many of which contain information critical to patient care, is astonishing. Patient safety will have been put seriously at risk as a result of this staggering incompetence.\nJeremy Hunt repeatedly blamed the problem on contractors but failed to acknowledge that this error was committed by a company part owned by his Department, over a period of several years during his time as Secretary of State.\nAs Jonathan asks in his letter, “How on earth did it happen that NHS Shared Business Services, failed to send so many letters and instead just left them lying in a warehouse? How much money and staff time has been wasted by this incident?\"\nPatients and their families will need much more reassurance that the Government actually has a plan to make sure this never happens again.\nThe Tories attack disabled people’s benefits as they only offer more damaging austerity\nLabour has called on Philip Hammond not to go ahead in next week’s budget with the £3.7bn worth of cuts to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) which will hit 160,000 disabled people.\nThe announcement, which was sneaked out last week, will mean 160,000 disabled people could see a loss in their income as a direct effect of the changes made by the government to how PIP is awarded.\nNext week, when they present the budget, no doubt the Tories will try to make out that the economy and the public finances are doing better, however, they are planning to go ahead with a £3.7 billion cut to the disabled.\nThis time last year when the economy and public finances were not doing as well, and the then Chancellor George Osborne tried to cut PIP, Labour stopped him. And in his u-turn he claimed that he could “absorb” the cost of reversing this cut.\nAdditionally, the Government have been accused this last week of sneaking out an announcement asking departments to model cuts of 3 per cent and 6 per cent for 2019-20.\nThis is no way to manage public spending. As Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP put it “For all Hammond’s talk of ‘resetting’ the Tory Government’s economic policy last summer it is now beyond doubt that Hammond represents more of the same Tory austerity. Hammond urgently needs to explain why this announcement was made in the way it was and why after seven years of failed austerity he thinks more of the same will now work.”\nThe Tories’ immigration policy is a complete mess\nLast week in my capacity as Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, I issued a press release in response to the release of the latest migration statistics, saying that “the Tories’ immigration policy is a complete mess. Despite their claims, they are still nowhere near to achieving their unworkable target.”\nIt continued that “The Tories blame the EU for this, but EU and non-EU long-term migration are the same, and each of them is way over 100,000 by themselves. The ONS are clear there was no statistically significant fall in net migration numbers. “\nIndeed, the only significant drop in the statistics was in international students, who enrich our education system and the wider economy and whose decline will make us all worse off.\nWe need a progressive, evidence-based approach on immigration that puts the needs of our economy first, rather than trying to appease hard-right voices for purely party-political reasons.\nRising Hate Crime Shows Need to Challenge Scapegoating\nRecently released analysis has confirmed that a majority of police forces in England and Wales saw recorded levels of hate crimes in the first full three months following the EU referendum.\nResponding to the analysis, David Isaac, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, warned that as the Brexit process continues, it would be advisable to ‘prepare for any possible spikes during the Brexit process’. He added that “The triggering of Article 50 is the next major milestone and we must do all we can to discourage hate attacks and to support people who feel at risk.”\nIt was welcome that cabinet minister Damian Green is on the record as saying that political debate in the UK is currently too abusive, yet now members of his government must do more in this regard. The Government’s own policies and rhetoric — both currently and over a number of years — have responsibility in this area. From go home vans, to demonising international students, to talking about a foreigner-free NHS this is a government whose policies are contributing to a climate of hate and fear.\nYou can read my full piece on the issue for Left Foot Forward here\nThe passing of Sir Gerald Kaufman MP\nI was very sad to hear news of the passing of my colleague and Father of the House Sir Gerald Kaufman MP this week.\nGerald worked with Harold Wilson when he was Prime Minister in the 1960s and became a Labour MP in 1970. As Jeremy Corbyn put it in a statement, “Gerald was always a prominent figure in the party and in Parliament, with his dandy clothes and wonderful demeanour in speaking. “\nAll of us in Parliament will deeply miss Gerald and his commitment to a better world.\nback ⇢",

These other costs include safeguarding and education, and ultimately, it is for the Home Office to ensure that councils receive adequate support so they can provide the housing and services these incredibly vulnerable people need.\nThe services have been run by the outsourcing firms G4S, Serco and Clearsprings since 2012, and this report is the latest in a series of critical reports by the committee.\nTwo-and-a-half years ago, MPs accused the Home Office of very similar failures, and it seems that the government has done nothing effective to remedy the situation, despite sharp criticism in this time period.\nIndeed, this Home Affairs Select Committee report a came just weeks after a much-delayed official report found that less than a quarter of state-run accommodation for asylum\nseekers is compliant with standards.\nIn this report, Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration David Bolt cited evidence of damp, dirty and vermin-infested properties, and found that some of the accommodation was found to be unsuitable for vulnerable groups.\nHe added that the inspection \"proved more challenging than most\" because of \"several reasons, not least the difficulty of extracting evidence from the Home Office.\"\nAccording to the report, Home Office contract officers - whose job it is to check accommodation meets the requirement of the contract - inspected 8,313 properties in 22 months and declared 3,567 (43%) as \"not fit for purpose\" or needing \"urgent\" repairs. Only 24% were found \"compliant\" with standards.\nMr Bolt also expressed concern about the way information on pregnant women and new mothers was recorded and shared, saying \"an overall grip on the numbers and distribution of pregnant and post-partum women within the asylum accommodation system is not a 'nice to have', but is essential to a proper understanding of whether the present policies and practices are meeting the needs of this particularly vulnerable group.\"\nIt is clear then that we are failing in our collective duty to people in this area.\nThese are people who are exercising their international legal right to seek asylum, and in many cases that right has been granted. Many of them will be very vulnerable people, frequently the victims of torture or other abuse, some suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Some will be pregnant women or have very young children.\nMany will be fleeing desperate circumstances of war, famine, water shortages, persecution and even attempted genocides.\nAs I have already mentioned, the housing is provided by private contractors, who of course are in it to make a profit.\nPrivate companies are not benevolent funds. The government insists in this case, and in all similar cases, that the private sector is a more efficient provider. But it offers no evidence for this repeated assertion.\nHow could it be that the private sector, where the costs charged to government must include a hefty profit margin, is a more efficient provider? In providing a service such as accommodation, the main ways to meet those profit targets are to over-charge the customer, which is ultimately you the taxpayer, as well as cutting back on the service provided.\nThat is why windows stay broken, heating doesn’t work or vermin are not eradicated. We are all worse off from this system, none more so than vulnerable asylum seekers themselves.\nThe medium-term solution is to bring all these contracts back into the public sector, where they can be properly administered and monitored. The likelihood is that taxpayers would also save money. At the very least, these disgraceful conditions would end.\nEveryone should be able to access decent housing, and the sooner these services are run by the public sector once more, the better.\nPrivate firms have no business running homes for asylum seekers, and Labour will end this rotten system.\nThese reports have played an invaluable role in highlighting this important issue - now lets build up the pressure for change.\nback ⇢",
  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_articles_item1714/content_25.html": "London’s Homelessness Crisis\nIn every classroom in London, there is on average one child who is living in emergency accommodation. This shocking and disgraceful fact was one of many uncovered recently by the cross-party London Councils group, which works across all the 32 London boroughs and the City of London. Their data also shows that nearly 170,000 people in the capital are now living in hostels, bedsits, or other temporary accommodation, and increase of 17,000 people in just one year, and that this includes 83,000 children.\nOf course, these statistics are just the start. Many more people live in even worse conditions, sofa-surfing or sleeping rough. According to St Mungo’s, there are 10,000 people sleeping rough in London, a tripling of the number from around 3,500 in 2008/09.\nWhen it comes to rough sleeping, Hackney is no different than many other boroughs. We rank slightly above average for number of people seen sleeping rough: 229, compared to a London average of 214. We also rank slightly below average for evictions at 2.2 per 1,000 households (compared to a London average of 2.42).\nBehind the data, the factors driving homelessness have sadly become only greater. 22% of people in Hackney have low paid jobs and Hackney has a shocking 10% more child poverty than the average London Borough. This low pay is squeezing households with ever higher rents, driven by Hackney’s new wave of gentrification.\nIn N16, a two-bedroom property will easily cost nearly £1,700pcm, far more than the whole salary of a minimum wage worker doing 40 hours a week. Rent increases have affected all of London, but east London has been particularly hard hit. In N15, at the northern border of our constituency, rents have increased 62% in the last 10 years, compared to just 13% in SW5 or 17% in SW7.\nCompounding the issue is the rising cost of living which stretches household budgets even further. On top of rising rents, in the year to June 2023, domestic gas prices increased by 36% and domestic electricity prices by 17%. These increases come after annual increases in the previous year of 95% for gas and 53% for electricity. UK food and non-alcoholic drink prices are 17.3% higher in May 2023 compared to the previous year.\nThe privatisation of housing and hollowing out of council housing has driven a surge in house prices and in private renting. More and more Londoners have seen the dream of home ownership slip through their fingers and the option of stable affordable social renting swallowed by profiteering by landlords, taking advantage of tenants with nowhere else to go.\nEndemic low pay means that these rent rises are far faster than anaemic pay rises. Housing costs constitute an ever-greater portion of renters expenses, at a time when the cost of food and other essentials rises ever faster. Tackling homelessness in London then, should start at its cause.We urgently need a new generation of social housing, empowering and compelling councils to build thousands of new council houses without the threat of Thatcherite landlords swooping in to turn a family home into their latest cash cow investment.\nWe also need immediate relief for Londoners and people across the UK. That can begin with an end to Section 21 No Fault evictions and giving regional mayors the power to implement rent controls.\nFinally, we need action on the causes of the cost-of-living crisis. Repealing anti-union legislation and awarding proper public sector pay rises to rectify a lost decade of austerity would go a long way to repair the damage done. This could be paid for with taxes on the bumper corporate profits that are the real drivers of inflation.\nAccompanying this should be a big hike in the minimum wage and uplift in universal credit to match the lag they saw over the last decade thanks to the political choices of the last decade.\nThe way out of this crisis is no secret and our government's failure to enact these solutions is a deliberate decision to keep thousands of Londoners, including children, without a permanent stable home.\nback ⇢",

Of course this includes the policeman Keith Palmer who was tragically killed while performing his duties. Our heartfelt thanks and deep gratitude go to him and to all of those who work to protect us, the police, security in parliamentary estate and all the staff.\nIt should never be part of anyone’s job to face violence and even murder while performing their duties.\nIt is too early now to debate the cause or motivation for this attack, indeed if there even was any. But until there is a full police investigation it can only be speculation. We first need evidence and analysis before attempting to draw any lessons from this incident.\nThere may be wild assertions about this attack by people claiming to know what the police can’t yet know, why this happened and who precisely was involved. We should reject any false or lazy assertions and wait for the police to do their work.\nBut it is important to state now: we will not be divided, we will not be cowed. Parliament, for all its faults is the forum where the representatives of the people meet to discuss, debate and pass laws. Any attack on it is an attack on democracy itself.\nThis is an attack on all of us, all our people, all our communities and our institutions. It must not be allowed to divide us, to change who we are or to erode our democracy. United together, we can always defeat those who threaten us.\nGovernment U-turn on £2 billion NICs rise in the Budget\nThe Government’s u-turn last week on its £2 billion NICs rise in the Budget is a humiliating reversal for the Chancellor forced upon him by Labour’s opposition. His authority is now shredded after just one Budget, and he tore up a manifesto commitment to do it.\nIn 2015, we had the tax credit shambles. In 2016, we had Personal Independence Payments reversal. Now in 2017 we have the u-turn on National Insurance Contributions.\nThis is also the second year we have had a Tory Budget with a black hole in it worth billions.\nAlready, the Budget will still see working people £1,400 worse off under the Government. What will the government do to fill the shortfall in a Budget without pursuing unfair tax increases or further cuts to public services?\nAfter seven years of Tory economic failure it is working households and small businesses who are taking the hit\nTuesday morning’s ONS statistics showed a 2.3 percent increase in inflation and the national debt at £1.7 trillion.\nAs inflation breaks through the Bank of England’s target for the first time in more than three years, real earnings are lower than they were before the crash.\nThis sharp increase in the cost of living means that after seven years of Tory economic failure, and it is working households and small businesses who are taking the hit with wage growth once again below price rises.\nScandals like this further support the case for Labour’s Tax Transparency Enforcement Programme\nThe Guardian revealed this week that some British banks were involved in the laundering of hundreds of millions of pounds from Russian criminals.\nAs Labour argued during the recent debates on the Criminal Finances Bill, Britain cannot be a haven for the criminals of the world who are looking to hide their money.\nAs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell MP pointed out, “The government’s overall approach to the banking sector is one that has seen them handout billions in tax giveaways that favour the big banks over the challenger banks, and pursue a ‘ light touch’ approach to regulation that borders on a return to the bad olds days before the crash.”\nScandals like this that only further support the case for Labour’s Tax Transparency Enforcement Programme. If the Tories will not act to clamp down on such acts, then the next Labour government will make them a thing of the past.\nThis unprecedented warning from trusts is a new low for this Government’s mishandling of our NHS\nNHS Providers warned this week that frontline NHS services face “mission impossible” in meeting next year’s targets. This is a new low for this Government’s disgraceful mishandling of our NHS.\nTheresa May has downplayed the worst winter crisis on record, in which nine out of ten hospitals were dangerously overcrowded, and ducked her responsibility to patients by failing to provide significant funding in the Spring Budget.\nYears of damaging Tory neglect have left the NHS unable to deliver on its constitution and yet ministers remain in denial of the crisis they have created.\nThe public now expects urgent and immediate action to provide patients with the world-class, 21st Century health and social care system they truly deserve.\nIn Education, the Tories are breaking yet another manifesto promise\nAn Education Policy Institute (EPI) report last week into school funding claimed that secondary schools could be forced to lose the equivalent of six teachers as a result of severe funding cuts.\nLabour supports fairer funding for our schools, but the Government’s formula simply moves already inadequate sums of money around - the overall pot is not being increased.\nAs Shadow Minister Angela Rayner MP pointed out, “Even without the proposed formula, schools are already seeing both real-terms cuts to their spending and rising costs on top. Headteachers are being forced to choose between cutting subjects or cutting the school week… Less than two years ago the Tories promised millions of parents that they would protect the money that is spent per pupil on their children’s education. This report shows that it is yet another manifesto promise they are\nbreaking.”\nPolice Cuts Make It Harder to Tackle Crime\nA report from the National Crime Agency last week highlighted how cybercrime is a growing concern for households and businesses, but this Tory Government is failing to provide the tools they need to protect themselves.\nThis is a further illustration of how already overstretched police forces are seeing further cuts to their government funding while having to react to these evolving crime patterns.\nAs I put it a press release “Criminal gangs accessing your private details through everyday items is the stuff of nightmares ministers urgently need to get a grip.”\nback ⇢",
  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_news_articles_item1637/content_76.html": "Let’s make 2019 the year when inhumane indefinite detention ends\n11 Feb 2019\nWe need to keep up the pressure on the Tories to scrap indefinite immigration detention writes Diane Abbott MP.Could this year finally be the year when indefinite immigration ends? This leadership of the Labour Party along with many long-time allies, is determined to make that happen.\nThe Government is in desperate trouble as its Brexit promises unravel. They have to produce new immigration legislation to plug the holes in the law created by Brexit. They need something positive amid all the chaos. So, we have even seen media speculation recently that in coming weeks the Government may finally move to limit the amount of time people can spend as a detainee in immigration centres to 28 days.\nThe UK immigration detention system is one of the widest in Europe, with around 2,500 to 3,500 people in detention at any given time. These issues are of the highest importance. It is wholly unacceptable for any democratic country to detain people without trial. The current chair of the Tory Party, Brandon Lewis once denied to parliament that we don’t detain people indefinitely in this country. We just keep them “for longer than is necessary”. This is the self-justifying nonsense that police states use.\nIn fact, when the Blair Government introduced immigration detention I well remember the repeated assurances that there was no need for due process, appeals procedures and so on, because people would be held for a matter of days. In fact, people have been detained for years on end. Pregnant women, victims of trafficking and children have all been detained.\nWe have seen pressure mounting on the government for some time to do the right thing and end indefinite immigration detention. It is a demand Labour now supports, and which I and others have been campaigning on for decades. It has also been a key pledge of our new immigration policy.\nA significant development is that the Windrush scandal has come to light and continues to unfold. Each month seeing more shocking revelations. This has had the effect of highlighting the long-term problems concerning immigration detention in general, the Government’s ‘hostile environment’ and the discrimination inherent in the current system.\nBoth Amnesty International and the British Red Cross have called for an end to indefinite detention and for the introduction of 28-day limit. The UN refugee agency has also backed calls for a time limit, with the UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner Volker Turk having said he hoped the study would result in limits being put in place, with detention only used as a “last resort.”\nWe should not take it for granted though that this Government will act for justice at all. We have already been waiting for the necessary reform for some time.\nWe also need to make sure that if the government does change the system and time limit, it is a genuine change, not one which allows them to play ‘cat and mouse’ by releasing and then re-detaining people.\nThere has also been no commitment from the Home Office to ending indefinite detention. The Government’s actual policies have been going in the opposite direction. The number of people held for over six months in immigration detention centres has increased, and that more than one in five\ndetainees are held for at least two months.\nSince this unjustifiable system was first introduced, the number of people detained has risen from the hundreds to the thousands. I was an MP when the legislation was introduced in the 1990s. At this time, Parliament was assured that detention would only be for a matter of months.\nThere are strong reasons why this Tory government has not yet reformed immigration detention. There are no good reasons. Numerous reports over a number of years have urged them to do so. But the policy has become part and parcel of Theresa May's 'hostile environment,’ which was brutally summarised by the Prime Minister herself as ‘deport first, appeal later’.\nThe current Home Secretary has tried to side-step the issue, by the simple expedient of rebranding it. But people are not fooled by the ‘compliant environment’. No British citizen who has lost a job, or a home or been detained or deported because they ‘look foreign’ is complying with anything. They are the victims of dog-whistle politics. Despite the change in rhetoric in recent times, the hostile environment remains in place.\nJust as that policy must now end, it is also absolutely essential to put a fair limit on detention if we are to ensure that there is no repeat of the Windrush scandal, which has shamed Britain and the government over the last year. You can’t hold people on suspicion. Either produce evidence which can be challenged, with availability of legal aid where necessary, or release them. Better yet, do those investigations before any detention is even contemplated.\nThe current policy is inhumane, costly, and unjustifiable. As long as indefinite detention continues it will cause real suffering to thousands of people.\nThe time has come for real change and for the Government to end the terrible practice of routine and indefinite use of detention.\nLet’s keep up the pressure up to make sure it happens.\nback ⇢",

But Home Secretary Amber Rudd's decision to deny any Inquiry at all into the incidents at the Orgreave coking plant in 1984 and subsequent events definitely falls into that category.”\nThe decision was also described at the time as \"a complete shock and a great disappointment\" by the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign.\nIt was an especially disappointing decision for the campaigners as they felt that the two Tory (now former) Home Secretaries, including Theresa May herself, had led them up the garden path.\nTheresa May's principal policy adviser Nick Timothy previously argued in favour of an Orgreave Inquiry, saying that “if the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know.”\nThe campaigners report that their discussions with the Home Secretaries had centred on the form an Inquiry might take, and there was no suggestion there would not be an Inquiry.\nIn the face of this disgraceful decision, the campaign for justice has continued, and grown, since.\nThe reality is that the decision to continue to deny an inquiry, including this latest proposal from the Bishop of Sheffied, is purely political.\nThis is perhaps not surprising as a central claim of the justice campaigners is that Orgreave showed that under Thatcher policing had come a political weapon.\nThatcher's Cabinet was determined to crush the miners' strike and found a willing instrument in the South Yorkshire force.\nThose of us who were involved with campaigning at the time can remember how the miners were seen – and portrayed by Tory media and politicians – as not only a challenge to the Tory government, but also the 'enemy within'.\nAn Inquiry would establish whether this is the case, and whether members of the Cabinet were responsible for directing political policing, or the cover-up.\nThis is a further example that Sajid Javid doesn’t represent the change of direction as Home Secretary that some of his supporters have been suggesting. It’s the same old Tories when it comes to workers’ rights and the political abuse of power.\nIn contrast to the Tories, we in Labour have promised a full inquiry and will keep up this fight. As I said in my speech to Labour Conference last year, we want justice and we'll have open inquiries into Orgreave and also into the blacklisting of trade unionists.\nThis denial of truth and justice cannot stand. Trade unionists, the labour movement, the leadership of the Labour Party and all those who believe the state should not be above the law will continue this fight.\nback ⇢",

  "http_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_/https_www_dianeabbott_org_uk_about-hackney/content_8.html": "Standing up for Hackney\nI am firmly committed to working for the people of Hackney. There are many issues that I campaign on in the local area. My priority is working hard for Hackney, listening to people about the issues that matter to them, and helping, in any way I can, with the problems that local people and their families are having.Here you can see my recent reports to the Hackney Local Constituency Labour Party:\nI am incredibly proud to call Hackney my home and to help give a voice to local people.\nSo it angers me that hard-working people in Hackney are footing the bill for this Government's economic failure. With prices rising faster than wages, the economy flatling and one million young people out of work, the Tory-led Government’s priority has been to cut taxes by an average of £100,000 for 13,000 people earning over £1 million. Policies like this aren’t going to help hard-working families in Hackney trying to make ends meet.\nThe inescapable truth is that this government is targeting the most deprived areas of England, including Hackney, for the deepest cuts in benefits, tax credits and council services, while protecting affluent parts of the country.\nThe list of 10 local authority areas hardest hit by the cuts includes seven out of the eight most disadvantaged parts of the country, according to the Government's own deprivation index. Hackney ranks in the list.\nHackney deserves better than this Tory government. I know my constituents are feeling really squeezed. The Tories are really beginning to show their true colours, zeroing in on areas like Hackney and hitting people hard.\nAnd to top it all, the fire station in Kingsland Road, Haggerston has now officially been named as one of 12 stations across the capital earmarked for closure, under plans by London Fire Brigade to save £28.2million over the next two years. Hackney Police Station is also pinpointed for closure, as part of the Met’s bid to make half a billion pounds worth of savings by 2016.\nCommunities facing the biggest hit to local government are also losing most from cuts to their tax credits and benefits, yet instead of helping working families the Tories are giving millionaires a tax cut.\nThat tells you everything you need to know about this Government's priorities.",

The Government had planned to give councils the power to relax Sunday trading laws, but Labour stood in solidarity with businesses, workers, trade unions and faith groups, which have long been campaigning against this proposal, to defeat the Government.\nLabour’s Shadow Secretary of State, for Business, Innovation and Skills, Angela Eagle said “the Government must now listen to the settled will of the House of Commons and confirm that they will not attempt to bring back these plans, which were not in the Tory election manifesto.”\nInternational Development Matters – Climate Change\nIn my capacity as Shadow Secretary of State for International Development, I wrote a blog for Left Foot Forward this week. In the piece I argue that as globally “those who have contributed the least to climate change are suffering the greatest impacts... the Labour Party is calling for the Government to ensure the UK takes our fair share of action to honour the Paris Agreement. “\nThis means we must rigorously pursue efforts to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees, and we must support developing countries to adapt to the already devastating impacts of our changing climate.\nYou can read the full piece here.\nJunior Doctors Dispute – the Tories are to Blame\nLast week saw a further 48 hour strike from Junior Doctors. The Labour party recognises the huge contribution junior doctors make and the years of training they go through to look after us. These are people dedicated to our health and our NHS. It’s time the Tories realised that and reached a negotiated settlement.\nYou can see me talking about the issue on a recent Question Time here and a video I made in January on the issue here.\nThe crisis of insecure work under the Tories is getting worse\nNew research from the Office of National Statistics has shown that over 800,000 people are now working on zero-hours contracts a rise by over 100,000.\nOwen Smith MP, Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary said: “Before the election the Tories promised to act on zero-hours contracts, but these numbers show that was nothing more than words,” adding that “spiralling numbers of British workers cannot be certain where their next day’s work is coming from, making it virtually impossible to plan finances and family life.”\nLooking ahead to George Osborne’s budget he added “The test for this Budget is whether it can start to lay the foundations for a modern economy. So the government must act on this crisis by [both] reversing the Universal Credit cuts and properly clamp downing on exploitative zero-hour contracts.”\nInternational Women’s Day - Labour announces creation of a Women’s Economic Commission\nLast Tuesday, myself and other members of the Shadow Cabinet met with former workers who originally campaigned for equal pay for women at the Dagenham car factory. Following this visit, the Labour Party announced the creation of a Women’s Economic Commission.\nKate Green MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Women and Equality, said: “Labour has ambitious plans for creating shared prosperity based on high skilled, well paid jobs. To do this we need to develop strategies to break down the barriers that will keep women and girls from taking up the opportunities from the jobs of the future. This will be a key part of the remit of the Women and the Economy Commission.”\nIndependent housing experts criticise the Government’s extreme Housing and Planning Bill – We need a Labour Mayor to tackle London’s Housing Crisis\nLast week saw the issuing of the final report of the IPPR’s London Housing Commission.\nCommenting on the report, John Healey MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Housing and Planning, said: “The Commission rightly say that starter homes selling for up to £450,000 will be unaffordable to first-time buyers. They echo Labour’s proposals that these homes should not be built against the wishes of local councils at the expense of affordable homes to rent and buy, and that any discount should be made permanent to protect the public investment and benefit future first-time buyers.”\nThe Government must now listen to the widespread criticism of its damaging Housing Bill and re-think its housing plans.\nOn Tuesday evening I attended the event to launch Sadiq Khan’s mayoral campaign manifesto, which includes strong commitments on housing. The IPPR report is yet more evidence that the people of Hackney North and Stoke Newington - and London more widely - desperately need a Labour Mayor who understands London’s housing crisis and has a plan to get to grips with it.\nYou can read Sadiq Khan’s manifesto for a Mayor for All Londoners here and volunteer to help his campaign here.\nInternational Development Matters – International Women’s Day Blog\nFor International Women’s Day on Tuesday March 8, I wrote a blog on women, global poverty and international development, arguing that “on International Women’s day, as we reflect on the fight for gender parity across the world, it is important to recognise that one of the biggest fights for women is the battle against poverty.”\nYou can read the full piece here.\nback ⇢",

The campaigners were led to believe only that there was debate on the form of Inquiry, but Amber Rudd and Theresa May have led them up them up the garden path.\nThe South Yorkshire Police chief constable is in favour of an inquiry, as are many stakeholders, and of course the campaigners themselves.\nThe current and previous Home Secretaries both indicated that an Inquiry would be granted, and Labour stands with the campaigners and will not rest until there is a full Hillsborough-style Inquiry.\n* You can read a report with further information here, my article for The Huffington Post here and about Jeremy Corbyn’s response here\nReports show that in some areas of the UK 47 percent of children are living in poverty and half a million emergency food parcels have been distributed by foodbanks in six months\nA recent report from the End Child Poverty Coalition showed that in some areas of the UK 47 percent of children are living in poverty.\nResponding to the report, Margaret Greenwood MP, Shadow Minister for Employment and Inequalities, said, \"Over half of those living in poverty are in working households. It’s clear that low pay, insecure work and the lack of affordable housing are taking their toll on UK families and the children of this country are suffering as a result,” adding that \"That’s why Labour is calling for the full reversal of damaging cuts to Universal Credit which will leave 2.5 million working families on average £2,100 worse off.”\nMeanwhile a report from the Trussell Trust has shown that half a million emergency food parcels have been distributed by foodbanks in six months.\nAs Debbie Abrahams MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said “this is a damming indictment of the Tory Government’s failure [and] it is clear that delays in benefits payments and changes to eligibility are a major cause behind this increase.”\nLabour would scrap the punitive sanctions regime and transform our social security system, ensuring that it is there for everyone in their time of need.\nIf Jeremy Hunt wants to support doctors and nurses to deliver a world class service he needs to start with the finances\nJonathan Ashworth MP, my successor as Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Health, has been doing a great job holding Jeremy Hunt to account for the deepening crisis facing our NHS and in arguing that whilst Jeremy Hunt is right to say we’ve got to be supporting doctors and nurses to deliver the highest quality healthcare in the world, with student nurse bursary cuts and picking a fight with junior doctors, the reality is that the Tory Government just aren’t doing that.\nAs Jonathan put it, “If Jeremy Hunt wants to support doctors and nurses to deliver a world class service he needs to start with the finances.”\n* Jonathan has also written on why The Tories must not use Brexit to harm the NHS which can be read here\nLabour won’t block article 50 – but don’t expect a blank cheque\nLast week was not a good week for the government. On Thursday the high court ruled that the prime minister was acting unlawfully in seeking to use prerogative powers to invoke article 50, and reminded her that only parliament can make or repeal laws.\nKeir Starmer MP, Shadow Minister for Brexit, has argued in response that the government should come clean and put the basic terms of its Brexit plan to the Commons for scrutiny.\n* You can read his full article on the issue here.\nPrevent: Responding to the Open Society Justice Initiative’s report\nA recent report from the Open Society Justice Initiative on Prevent had disturbing findings. In a response in my capacity as Shadow Home Secretary I have noted that “Up to 2014, nearly 4000 people had been referred to by the police on suspected extremism, most of them under Prevent, and the fact that most of these referrals go nowhere should raise alarm bells.”\nWe need a genuine anti-terrorist strategy engages with communities, but Prevent has fanned the flames of suspicion and mistrust.

They are a cynical attempt to force through a No Deal Brexit.”\nJohn added, “Any responsible Prime Minister would have spent the past three months trying to build a consensus in Parliament and across the EU in order to break the deadlock. However, Boris Johnson has neither the intention nor ability to negotiate a deal or protect jobs and communities across the United Kingdom.”\nHe is totally out of touch when he offers more tax cuts to the rich and corporations, when just yesterday we heard that 726 homeless people died on our streets last year. Additionally, there are four and a half million children living in poverty, with wages below the level that they were at the time of the 2008 economic crash.\nThis crisis the Tories have plunged our country into can only be settled by letting the people decide. We need a general election, followed by a public vote, as soon as the threat of No Deal is off the table.\nBackstop proposals represent another failure of government’s Brexit negotiating strategy\nKeir Starmer, Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary, has responded this week to reports of the Government’s ‘alternative’ to the backstop, saying that “If Boris Johnson had spent any time listening to businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable.”\nThey would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist.\nCrucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.\nAs Keir also, said, “If accurate, these proposals represent yet another failure of the government’s negotiating strategy. The Prime Minister should admit he has no credible plan for Brexit and that the only way to resolve this issue is to go back to the people with a public vote.”\nBoris Johnson has been caught out lying about a new hospital in Canterbury\nIt was reported this week that Boris Johnson has been caught out lying about a promise of a new hospital in Canterbury.\nThe reality is that the Tory ‘promise’ of 40 new hospitals unravelled as spin.\nBoris Johnson should apologise for raising hopes of patients and NHS staff in Canterbury like this. Yet again this sorry episode proves you simply can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.\nChancellor refuses to commit to ending the social security freeze\nThe Tory Chancellor this week refused to commit to ending the social security freeze at Treasury Questions, leaving the door open to further cuts to income for the poorest in our society.\nAlthough this was previously Government policy, the Chancellor has not set out any proposals for funding a lift in the freeze from April 2020.\n14 million people are now in poverty in the UK, but all those struggling are an afterthought to this Tory government.\nThe Chancellor should immediately confirm that he will end the social security freeze in 2020, and set out his plans to fund this measure.\nA record 726 homeless people died last year – a damning indictment of Tory austerity\nNew ONS figures this week revealed that a record 726 people died homeless last year. These figures are simply shameful in a country as rich as ours.\nThis is the highest year-to-year increase (22 per cent) since records began.\nLabour is clear that high and rising homelessness is not inevitable. The number of people sleeping on our streets fell under Labour but has risen since 2010 as a direct result of the Conservatives slashing investment for low-cost homes, cutting back housing benefit, reducing funding for homelessness services, and denying protection to private renters.\nThe next Labour government will end rough sleeping within a Parliament and tackle the root causes of rising homelessness with more affordable homes and stronger rights for renters.\nIt’s about time the government started to invest in our young people\nThis week Cat Smith MP, Shadow Minister for Youth Affairs, responded to the Chancellor’s announcement of funding of youth services, saying, “It’s about time the government started to invest in our young people, however the Chancellor’s announcement falls far short from the funding needed to rebuild our decimated youth service.”\nThe reality is that we cannot trust this government is serious about ending austerity and championing young people’s needs.\nOnly Labour will match the ambition of our young people by giving them the support they need, so that every young person can access high quality youth work in their community.\nback ⇢",
