Sad to see the individual result but so happy with the overall one and to see so many labour mps across Kent.\nWell done Lenny, you much increased the Labour vote in a Tory stronghold - that's a great achievement in itself! 👍 You may not have won the seat this time but you must certainly have made the Tories uncomfortable in it! ❤️\nWell done Lenny- and best wishes to you and your family.\nLoad More\nIt was good to speak with Mike from Staplehurst He voted for the Conservatives before but has decided to Vote Labour at this General Election. It isn't just Lib Dems & Greens who have had enough of the Conservatives it is traditional Tory voters. The only party who can win against them in Weald of Kent is Labour.\nwww.getvoting.org/constituency/E14001570\nThe choice today is clear. Between a changed Labour Party that stands ready to restore politics to service and rebuild Britain.\nOr a Tory party that crashed our economy, left public services in ruin, and now wants to give us Liz Truss 2.0 with more unfunded spending promises.\nMike knows he cannot afford five more years under the Conservatives and that #change will only happen if he votes Labour.\n#VoteLabour #staplehurst #GE2024 #wealdofkent #TacticalVoting #labourdoorstep\nWeald of Kent Labour Weald of Kent Young Farmers Club Marden, Kent Biddenden Community Tenterden, Kent - The Jewel of the Weald @followers ...

Vote Lenny and Labour today!\nOn meeting Lenny I found him genuine, approachable, a good listener and hardworking, just the sort of person I want to represent me as my MP.
