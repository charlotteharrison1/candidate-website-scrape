Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition.

Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA).

Since being elected, Harriet has got stuck in with representing Gordon and Buchan in Westminster. She has lead debates in both the chamber and in Westminster Hall on the top issues that affect Gordon and Buchan as well as raising multiple questions in PMQs and to relevant Ministers both on the floor of the House and in writing.\nIn November 2024 Harriet was appointed an opposition assistant whip by RT Hon Kemi Badenoch MP.\nHarriet has also joined a number of All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPG) since joining the UK Parliament. These include groups on Marine Energy where she sits as an officer, and the Wood Panel Industry where she sits as Vice Chair.\nBefore being elected Harriet Cross worked as a Chartered Rural Surveyor, working across Aberdeenshire and the Highlands. Her work brought her to the heart of Gordon & Buchan, working with farmers, landowners and rural communities in matters ranging from valuations to infrastructure schemes.\nHarriet lives in Aberdeenshire with her partner and their black Labrador Mia. Having grown up in the Republic of Ireland, Harriet moved to Aberdeenshire in her mid-teens when her father took over the running of the community pharmacy in Braemar. She studied Zoology at Imperial College London, followed by a master’s degree in Rural Land & Business Management at the University of Reading, where she graduated with Distinction. Having completed her graduate training programme, gaining her chartership in Cambridge, Harriet returned home to Aberdeenshire in 2018.\nHarriet spends as much time as she can in the hills around Aberdeenshire. She is a keen runner and hill walker and believes that fresh air and switching off from the media for a few hours is the key to a balancing a busy life.\nHarriet is determined to see the promises made to the residents and businesses in Gordon & Buchan in recent years upheld – In particular the dualling of the A96, upgrades to the A90 and the protection of community hospitals. More broadly, she wants to see the farmers across Aberdeenshire supported in their primary aim – feeding the nation – and has built a strong relationship with the sector as MP and in her work before entering Parliament. Harriet has also been a vocal supporter of the Oil & Gas sector and the tens of thousands of workers it employers during the transition to renewable energy.\nIf there you have any questions or concerns, please contact Harriet by clicking here:-",
