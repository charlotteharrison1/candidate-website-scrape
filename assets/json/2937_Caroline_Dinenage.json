This is of particular concern to the Gosport constituency, given the number of discharges in the constituency in recent months.\nThe plans will be subject to consultation before being implemented.\nSpeaking in support of the news, Caroline Dinenage said:\n“I am glad that the government is acting on this issue. Sewage discharges have a particularly detrimental effect to the Gosport constituency, given the large amount of shoreline in the constituency.\n“I personally enjoy swimming in the sea, and I know many others in the constituency do too, so its relieving to hear that the government is listening and looking to tackle this issue. This will help to encourage long term investment to overcome the problem for good.\n“Constituents are understandably angry about sewage discharges. I hear stories in my inbox about people who have become unwell after sea swimming. I am relieved that affirmative action is being taken by central government, and I will continue to do all that I can to act on sewage discharges.”\nEnvironment Secretary Ranil Jayawardena said:\n“I have been clear that if water companies don’t do what is expected, there will be consequences. Bigger financial penalties will act as a greater deterrent and push water companies to do more, and faster, when it comes to investing in infrastructure and improving the quality of our water.\n“This 1,000-fold increase sends a clear signal that we want clean rivers and coastlines, and that the duty falls to the water companies to deliver – the polluter must pay.”\nEnvironment Agency Chief Executive Sir James Bevan said:\n“Since 2015 the Environment Agency’s criminal prosecutions against water companies have secured fines of over £138 million – with a record £90 million fine handed out to Southern Water for corporate environmental crime.\n“However, criminal prosecutions can be lengthy and costly, so we welcome today’s proposals which will make it easier for us to hold water companies to account for environmental crimes.\n“We will now work closely with government to put this plan into action.”",

I’ve made objections to Fareham Borough Council, the Planning Inspectorate and even persuaded the Secretary of State for Housing to ‘call in’ planning applications. We have had remarkable success via these routes, until now. Unfortunately, on this occasion all efforts have been in vain.\nMore generally, I have consistently raised concerns throughout both the Consultation process for Fareham Borough Council’s Local Plan, via letter and also in direct conversations with the Leader of the Council.\nOn the wider issue of housing numbers, I’ve frequently raised local concerns with the Minister, including in the House of Commons chamber. I’ve even arranged for Gosport Councillors and Council Officials to meet with the Housing Minister and Government Officials to outline our concerns on more than one occasion.\nGosport Borough Council are also facing unrealistic housing numbers and I have had extensive conversations, letters and meetings with the Housing Minister to try and work through potential mitigations which might reduce our quota, including our peninsular location and building density.\nPlease rest assured that I have and will continue to represent the concerns of both constituents and the Council and will continue to fight to protect our area from unwanted developments.",

Since then, Vernon block has been permanently closed and earmarked for demolition, and work has started on a brand-new accommodation block at the site.\nIn a follow up question to the Ministry of Defence on November 20th, Caroline asked:\n“The Minister may be aware that earlier this year one of the accommodation blocks in HMS Collingwood in my Gosport constituency was shut down all together because it just simply was not fit for human habitation. There are also some issues with the accommodation blocks in HMS Sultan. Could I invite the Minister to come to Gosport to have a look at some of the accommodation on offer for our service personnel? It is simply not good enough, and they deserve better.”\nDuring his visit, the Minister had a chance to look at accommodation blocks of both HMS Collingwood and HMS Sultan to see the work that has been done to improve living standards and what still needs to be done. He thanked Caroline for bringing attention to the issue of Naval Base accommodation over recent years.\nThe Minister said:\n“I know that Caroline has been raising the issue of accommodation for two years, and while we have seen improvements, there is more to be done. Infrastructure is a real priority and a big part of recruitment and retention so it is very important in the Gosport constituency where so many military personnel are based.”\nFollowing the visit, Caroline said:\n“I would like to thank the Minister for his prompt visit to Gosport. It is great to see that he shares my commitment to improving the quality of accommodation for our Navy personnel. Both HMS Collingwood and HMS Sultan deliver an extremely high level of professional training, and the courses can be very long, so it’s important for well-being, morale, and staff retention that they are offered a decent standard of accommodation during their stay.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nNotes to editors:\n- You can watch Caroline’s oral question here: Parliamentlive.tv - House of Commons.",

In 2022, they responded to 135 incidents, 8 of which were life-at-risk. The volunteers often cover unsociable hours, with 61 weekend duty call-outs in 2022, and 65 out-of-hours callouts.\nCaroline also praised the work of Gosport National Coastguard Institute (NCI) and Lee on the Solent NCI. They are also a voluntary organisation who watch the coastline to flag incidents and ensure the safety of local residents.\nCaroline is a supporter of the recently launched National Independent Lifeboat Association (NILA), of which GAFIRS is a founding member.\nIn the debate, Caroline said:\n“GAFIRS provides emergency lifeboat cover to the Eastern Solent and Portsmouth Harbour. Those of you that know that area will know that it is an incredibly busy stretch of water. Certainly the busiest on the South Coast, if not the busiest in the UK.”\n“GAFIRS provides an absolutely essential service to civilian safety. I simply can’t stress enough the value of them. In 2022, GAFIRS responded to 135 incidents, making it their busiest year in 12 years and their third busiest in the last 29 years.”\n“They are quite simply local heroes, and quite simply lives would be lost without them.”\n“I would like to take the opportunity to also thank the National Coast watch Organisation, they operate out of Fort Blockhouse and out of Lee on the Solent. They provide eyes along the coast and an invaluable service to local people. I am extraordinarily proud to have them and GAFIRS in my local community, and I would like to put on record my enormous thanks and gratitude.”\nThe responding Minister, Richard Holden, said:\n“During these challenging time, it is important that we continue to support our life saving services and recognise the contribution of search and rescue services across the UK.”\n“I’d like to thank our brave volunteers in the independent lifeboats but also the RNLI and HM Coastguard who risk their own lives to save others at sea, and around the coast line. It is in large part due to their skill and dedication that the UK has one of the best water safety records in the world.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nNotes to editors:\nFor more information about the National Independent Lifeboat Association, please go to https://www.caroline4gosport.co.uk/news/gosport-mp-backs-new-national-independent-lifeboat-association",

More than four in ten new recruits since April 2020 are female and nearly 12 per cent of new recruits identify as belonging to a Black, Asian, Mixed or other minority ethnic group.\nHowever, the figures show Labour Mayor’s Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, who run the Met and Greater Manchester Police forces, the largest and third largest forces in the country, failed to meet their targets for recruiting additional officers. Sadiq Khan fell 133 officers short of his target and Andy Burnham fell 30 short of his.\nThe 13,576 extra officers will support the Conservative Government’s crackdown on crime, which has seen the launch of the Beating Crime Plan and the passing of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill through the House of Commons. This builds on the action already taken by the Conservative Government since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister two years ago–including boosting police funding to a record £15.8 billion and delivering £70 million through the Safer Streets Fund to make neighbourhoods secure.\nCommenting, Caroline said:\n“I know just how vital it is to have more police on our streets to crack down on crime in our local community.\n“The 479 additional recruits mean there are now 3,300 police officers in Hampshire helping to pursue criminals, keep neighbourhoods safe, and reassure the law-abiding majority.”\nCommenting, Home Secretary Priti Patel said:\n“When this Government took office in 2019, we made a promise to the British people to recruit 20,000 extra police officers to cut crime and keep communities safe-and we are delivering on that pledge.\n“These extra officers are getting out on the streets helping to cut crime and protect communities up and down the country–and they are reflecting the communities they serve better than ever before, with the highest ever proportion of female officers and officers from diverse backgrounds out there making a difference.\n“It is disappointing to see Labour Mayors in charge of some of our biggest police forces failing to meet their targets for recruiting more officers, particularly given how quick they are to tour TV studios demanding more help from the government for their own failures.”\n“Our Beating Crime Plan will give these officers the powers they need to stop crimes happening, support victims and keep serious offenders in prison for longer–keeping the streets safer for all.”\nENDS\nFor more information please contact [email protected].\nNotes to Editors\n- Home Office figures show 13,576extra police officers have been recruited nationally in Q32021 (Home Office, Official Statistics, 27 April 2022, Police officer uplift, England and Wales, quarterly update to 31 March 2022 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk))\n- The Safer Streets Fund has already committed£70 million in making our streets safer.

It is one of the nation’s biggest killers. To improve survival rates, St John is seeking to empower communities to learn first aid as CPR and defibrillation can more than double the chances of survival. In 2023, St John attended over 158 cardiac arrests, saving over 39 lives. The charity is calling on guardians of defibrillators to register their devices on the Circuit: The Nation’s National Defibrillator Network.\nDuring her visit, volunteers provided an overview of St John activities in the area, delivered a demonstration of a full resuscitation scenario and training on using an Automated External defibrillator. St John trains 215,000 people in first aid every year and volunteers provided first aid cover at 8,500 events in 2023 enabling thousands of events to happen safely. This is part of the organisation’s commitment to keep our communities safe.\nCaroline was briefed on the unit’s latest local projects which included strengthening the recruitment of youth leaders to support the delivery of St John Ambulance’s Badger and Cadet youth programmes with 9,000 participants to build upon the 56,600 hours delivered by young people in support of event first aid operations in 2023. This is all part of the charity’s commitment to ensure every young person is first aid confident by the age of 25.\nSt John volunteers play their part in enhancing community first aid resilience by providing first aid training, supporting local events and providing ambulance crews to deliver emergency support to the NHS.\nDame Caroline Dinenage MP for Gosport said:\n“I would like to thank St John Ambulance volunteers for inviting me to learn more about their lifesaving work in Gosport. I was impressed to learn about the first aid services they provide locally and the role St John volunteers play in supporting the NHS and communities.\n“All of us have seen them standing by, ready for action, at events of all kinds across Hampshire. I was interested to hear about the Unit’s desire to grow the number of volunteers and opportunities for young people to ensure every young person is first aid confident. I encourage people across Gosport to get involved with St John Ambulance’s work to help save lives.\n“We know when it comes to cardiac arrests every second counts which is why it’s vital that we train more people in first aid and strengthen public access to defibrillators to boost survival rates. I urge owners of defibrillators in Gosport to register their devices on the Circuit: the nation’s national defibrillator network, to ensure they are accessible to ambulance services. I look forward to continuing to work with St John Ambulance to raise awareness of the vital role of volunteers in putting first aid at the heart of our communities.”\nWendy McCormick Unit Manager said:\n“We were delighted to welcome Dame Caroline Dinenage MP to our Gosport Unit. At St John, we are best known for providing event first aid cover and first aid courses, but we offer so much more than this including delivering an inspiring array of youth programmes. Visits such as this encourage more people to actively support our lifesaving work.\n“Right now, we are actively recruiting for Youth Leaders. The youth and adults are an integral part of the community in Gosport. We encourage people of all ages to get involved. We look forward to working with Caroline Dinenage MP to expand volunteer opportunities in Gosport and strengthen public access to first aid training and equipment to help save lives.”\nKit Bowerin Policy & Public Affairs Officer said:\n“I would like to congratulate our incredible volunteers for everything they do to serve their local community and enhance first aid resilience in Gosport.\n“At St John Ambulance, we believe Community First aid Saves Lives, that’s why we are looking at how as a trusted partner to the NHS and local communities, we can respond, educate, and lead standards in first aid to improve health outcomes and save lives.\n“We look forward to working closely with Dame Caroline Dinenage MP as Chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to strengthen opportunities for young people to learn lifesaving first aid skills and break down the barriers to volunteering.”\nTo find out more about St John Ambulance’s clinically trained volunteers and their work please visit www.sja.org.uk or contact [email protected]\nENDS",

Most recently, she vented her frustration with the slow progress at the site, saying in April that “The site has huge economic and regeneration potential for our community and the [Defence Infrastructure Organisation] DIO must move forward swiftly on their plans to deliver it.” Gosport Borough Council have recognised the housing and employment space potential of the site.\nCaroline has also been a strong advocate for the regeneration of Fort Gilkicker which she visited in September 2024 in order to see the progress being made at the site, where 26 luxury homes are being built. However, she expressed frustration at the significant obstacles which various bodies impose on regeneration saying “these organisations are quick to impose punitive conditions on a project to breathe new life into listed buildings, but are suspiciously silent all the time they sit abandoned, rotting into the ground”.\nNow the Culture, Media, and Sport Select Committee, which has responsibility for scrutinising the work of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and its associated public bodies, is seeking evidence from anyone who wishes to answer the questions put to the public in the inquiry’s call for evidence.\nLaunching the inquiry, Caroline said:\n“Historic buildings are the centrepiece of many communities across the country, and contribute hugely to the vibrancy of an area. Sadly our built heritage faces a range of threats, not just financial, but also from the burdensome restrictions which make their restoration and upkeep so costly and bureaucratic.\n“The perilous state of old buildings on military property is illustrative of what can happen when historic assets on public land are subject to managed decline.\n“This inquiry will shine a light on the huge benefits historic sites bring and see what more can be done to break down the barriers to their preservation and ensure they can continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nYou can read the call for evidence here: https://committees.parliament.uk/call-for-evidence/3515/.\nYou can receive updates on the Committee’s inquiry here: https://committees.parliament.uk/work/8742/protecting-built-heritage/.",

The letter calls for the benefits that come from freeports, to be extended to the whole of the UK coastline, as well as ensuring that connectivity between the coast and the rest of the country is improved.\nDespite attracting millions of visitors over the summer period, without additional intervention, many coastal communities are set to fall further behind than the rest of the country.\nCaroline has always worked to support local business and enterprise, and has worked closely with Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) since its establishment in 2011 – aiming to develop sustainable economic growth and private investment in the Solent.\nCommenting Caroline said:\n“Our coastal communities, including my own constituency of Gosport, have been disproportionately affected over recent years.\n“I want to ensure that both individuals and businesses in our local area feel supported and are not adversely affected over the coming months. It is therefore of the utmost importance that our next Prime Minister supports and drives an economic plan that targets our coastal communities.”\nAn extract from the letter:\n“We look to the next Prime Minister to support and drive an economic plan that targets coastal communities. Areas that without intervention are set to lose at least 49 per cent of their young people.\n“Maritime industries invest over £600m a year in the communities they are in, but there are actions Governments can take to strengthen the overall ecosystem for these businesses; by creating the right conditions to invest further, create jobs and opportunities throughout the UK.\n“Freeports are already generating positive interest in more investment in coastal communities and would ask that you consider extending the benefits of freeports to the rest of the coast.”\nENDS\nFor more information please contact [email protected].",

This will take effect from 6pm tonight (23rd March 2022) and will be in place until March 2023.\n- VAT Relief - homeowners having materials like heat pumps, solar panels or insulation installed with pay 0% VAT as opposed to the standard 5%, this will save families up to £8,000 on installation and up to £300 per year on their energy bills. Wind and Water turbines will also be zero rated – reversing the EU’s decision.\n- Doubling the Household Support Fund to £1bn, distributed via Local Authorities, supporting the country’s most vulnerable households.\n- £330 tax cut – from July people will be able to earn £12,570 a year without paying any Income Tax or National Insurance.\n- Employment Allowance will increase to £5,000, a tax cut worth up to £1,000 for half a million small businesses.\nCommenting Caroline said:\n“The last few months have been extremely tough for many of the Gosport Constituency’s residents and I am glad that the Chancellor’s Budget aims to provide further assistance and support to households with the rising cost of living.\nMany of my constituents have contacted me with concerns about the rising cost of fuel amidst other price rises and so I welcome the decision to cut fuel duty by 5%, and the National Insurance reduction, which will more than cover the new NI Levy for the 70% least well-off. This will make a profound difference to many households.”\nDelivering the Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:\n“This statement puts billions back into the pockets of people across the UK and delivers the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century.\nLike our actions against Russia, I have been able to do this because of our strong economy and the difficult but responsible decisions I have had to make to rebuild our finances following the pandemic.\nCutting taxes means people have immediate help with the rising cost of living, businesses have better conditions to invest and grow tomorrow, and people keep more of what they earn for years to come.”\nThis support is in addition to assistance with the cost of living that was announced earlier this year. This includes:\n- A £200 ‘smoothing’ rebate on energy bills for all households\n- A non-repayable £150 cash rebate for homes in Council Tax bands A-D – equivalent to 80 per cent of all households, helping both lower and middle income families.\n- £144 million of discretionary funding for local authorities to support households not eligible for the council tax rebate.\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected] .\nNotes to Editors\n- Caroline is arranging a public event where local people can get information and assistance regarding energy bills and the cost of living on Saturday 26 March.

Leeds, Newcastle and Snaresbrook (London) Crown Courts have been chosen as they are currently dealing with a higher-than-average number of sex offence cases.\nCourtrooms will also be equipped with new video technology and be able to take advantage of the rapid rollout of pre-recorded cross-examination for victims of rape. This spares victims, subject to a successful application to the court, the stress of giving evidence during a live trial and has already been introduced at 37 courts.\nThe initiative comes one year on since the Government published its Rape Review Action Plan, with an update showing that considerable headway is being made in increasing convictions and improving support for victims.\nAlongside this, the Government is continuing to roll out Operation Soteria, a new approach to investigating rape that focuses on the suspects not the victims. It involves academics working with police forces to examine their handling of rape cases and make recommendations for operational changes. It is already in action in five police force areas and will soon be rolled out to a further 14 forces by September.\nOver £460 million is being invested in victim support over the next three years, increasing the amount spent per year by 2025 by 92 per cent compared to 2020/21.\nThis announcement builds on the publication of a draft Victims Bill which will amplify victims ’voices and make justice agencies more accountable for the service they deliver.\nCommenting, Caroline said:\n“Rape is a horrific crime that can have life-long devastating impacts on its victims, which is why it is essential that victims get the best support possible as they seek justice.\n“That is why am I really pleased to see this Conservative Government pledging a £460 million investment in victims services and introducing new pilots to boost support for rape victims in court, just as new data reveals that rape convictions are up two thirds over the last year.\n“This will make sure victims get the help and support they need as those who harm them are put behind bars.”\nCommenting, Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Dominic Raab said:\n“Rape convictions are up two thirds over the last year and cases are being completed five weeks quicker.\n“But we are restless to go further, and these pilots will focus on improving support for victims, tackling the backlog and reducing delays.\n“We’re also rolling out pre-recorded evidence faster, recruiting 1000 sexual violence advisors, developing a 24/7 helpline and improving collaboration between police and prosecutors to ensure victims get the justice they deserve.”\nCommenting, Home Secretary Priti Patel said:\n“Rape is an abhorrent crime and I want to see a transformation in the way these investigations are handled to make sure that all victims have the best support possible throughout the entire process.\n“By making police investigations less intrusive and putting victims at the forefront, we can improve the way in which the police handle these cases, so that the brave victims who come forward are not let down and the criminals responsible are put behind bars”.\nENDS\nFor more information please contact [email protected].",

Currently Fareham and Gosport Borough Councils are delivering 211 houses annually.\nThe previous Conservative Government gave greater weight to local voices in planning decisions. However, in her letter, Baroness Taylor said that ‘I also note that you all feel that if these targets are missed then it may permit unplanned and speculative development. Where housing delivery lags behind local need, it is right that developers can bring new homes forward outside the plan.’\nAn article from October stated that Gosport has “no idea where to build ‘extra’ new homes for government housebuilding targets”, prompting fears that the likely failure to hit inflated housing targets will result in a housebuilding free-for-all in an area which is already ‘over 80% built on’.\nCaroline said:\n‘This letter suggests that the Government intends to press on with its plans to eradicate the local Strategic Gap with unfettered development.\n‘I have deep concerns over what this means for the Gosport constituency in terms of quality of life. Recent analysis found that Gosport is already the least green town in the UK. More development will lead to worsening air quality and serious strain on local services.

A reported 14 million fans entered a digital queue to buy 1 million tickets, with some fans waiting in the queue for ten hours.\nA standard ticket cost £148 but due to the dynamic pricing mechanism some fans discovered after queueing that the price had more than doubled.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority have opened an investigation into the sale, which will consider whether people ‘were given clear and timely information to explain that the tickets could be subject to so-called ‘dynamic pricing’ with prices changing depending on demand, and how this would operate, including the price they would pay for any tickets purchased’ and whether people ‘were put under pressure to buy tickets within a short period of time – at a higher price than they understood they would have to pay, potentially impacting their purchasing decisions’.\nSpeaking after the debate, Caroline said:\n‘The Oasis ticket debacle has highlighted the rotten nature of the music ticketing market for all to see.\n‘I am glad that the Government has included the primary market in its consultation but it’s clear from the lousy experience of fans that a wider review is needed.\n‘The Grassroots Music Venues report that the Culture, Media, and Sport Committee produced made plenty of sensible suggestions to address issues within the live music sector and I hope that the Government examine them closely before responding to that report this Autumn.’\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nCaroline’s contribution in the debate can be watched here: https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/d439fb88-5c5c-48c5-a0db-c715e09f78d2?in=18:30:22",

  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_mp-hosts-one-small-thing-parliament/content_117.html": "Last week, local MP and former Justice Minister, Dame Caroline Dinenage, hosted an event with One Small Thing Charity on the intergenerational traumatic impact of maternal imprisonment and the need for urgent reform.\nAttendees at the event, which included MPs and Ministry of Justice staff, heard from Farhana and Jamilah, who both spoke movingly about the impact of their own mother’s sudden and unexpected imprisonment on their lives. The event also heard from Sophie Mitchell from Northumbria University who has completed her PhD on this very important topic. Her findings highlight a need for urgent reform.\nCourts do not routinely take into account the rights of children when sentencing mothers, and One Small Thing are calling for this to change.\nWomen account for around 5% of the prison population in England and Wales and around 60% of these are estimated to be mothers. Sadly, many of these women have high levels of mental health needs and are often kept on average 64 miles from home, meaning that some children never visit their mothers. This has a profound impact on families, with only 5% of children staying in the family home when their mother goes to prison.\nCommenting Caroline said:\n“For female offenders, trauma-informed, gender-responsive programmes are the only way to break the cycle of crime, incarceration and intergenerational trauma.\n“Farhana and Jamilah spoke so powerfully about their mother who was unexpectedly given a prison sentence while they and their siblings were at school. Nobody came to pick them up that day and they ended up in the care system, with their belongings in a bin-bag. The youngest was only five years old. The long term trauma of this is unimaginable.\n“I fully support the work of One Small Thing Charity in achieving this and will do what I can to drive change in this area.”\nThe charity One Small Thing were established by criminologist and Prison Philanthropist, Edwina Grosvenor, who has recently been appointed High Sheriff of Hampshire.\nThe charity works to redesign the justice system for women and their children. They facilitate trauma-informed and gender-responsive programmes for the prison and community sectors that consider the individual caught in a cycle of crime and incarceration and aim to humanise their process.\nCommenting Lady Edwina Grosvenor Founder of One Small Thing Charity, said:\n\"We were delighted to have Caroline’s support to host our Parliamentary Reception on maternal imprisonment, giving us an opportunity to raise this important issue with key stakeholders and decision makers.\"\n\"Maternal imprisonment has a traumatic impact on women, the children they are separated from, and wider family members who often have to provide care. This impact can be felt across generations long after a prison sentence is completed.”\n“We believe that system reform such as better pre-sentence information at the court and family visit policies in prisons, financial support for kinship carers and access to housing on release would make a huge difference to reduce this traumatic impact. However fundamentally community-based alternatives to custody for women and mothers who would otherwise be serving short prison sentences are the only way forward, such as the project we are piloting in Hampshire called Hope Street. The event also allowed us to raise that data on the number of women with children and pregnant women in the Justice System needs to be routinely collected and published.\"\nCaroline also recently highlighted this issue in the House of Commons in an Oral Parliamentary Question to Ministry of Justice Minister, Victoria Atkins.\nENDS\nFor more information please contact [email protected].\nNotes to Editors\n- If you wish to watch Caroline’s OPQ please visit https://fb.watch/e6xtDarFsW/.\n- You can read a summary of Sophie Mitchell’s research on this topic at Research and Evidence — One Small Thing.",

The Summer Passport Scheme has run since 2008 and provides hundreds of children annually with three weeks of free activities during the summer holidays. HAF funding also supports GlobeFit at Newtown Primary School, and Y Services for Young People.\nWritten questions to the Government have elicited no funding commitment past the financial year 2024/25. A recent response in answer to a question from Labour MP for Walsall and Bloxwich Valerie Vaz, said:\n‘The department’s budgets for 2025/26 will be confirmed in due course, including the exact funding available for this type of support for children, young people and families during the holidays.’\nFunding has been committed until March 2025\nAlongside sending the letter, Caroline said:\n‘Every year I see the fantastic opportunities offered to young people in Gosport, Lee on Solent, Stubbington, and Hill Head by the Holiday Activities and Food Programme.\n'With the school Easter holidays approaching quickly it's imperative that Councils and staff are given certainty over funding streams so that parents and children know what support is available.”\nShadow Secretary of State for Education, Laura Trott, said:\n‘The Education Secretary seems intent on taking an axe to yet another success of the previous Conservative Government – the Holiday Activities and Food programme. I cannot see any other reason that she would not commit to a programme that was proven to provide financial relief to parents, and that was universally popular among the children who participated, many of whom were on free school meals.’\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

A number of local dentists and dental care representatives attended a roundtable event with the Minister, including Smile Dental Care Gosport, MyDentist Gosport and Fareham Road Surgery, as well as representatives from the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Local Dental Committee.\nNow the NHS Dental Recovery Plan, announced on Wednesday sets out a package of measures to deliver 2.5 million additional NHS dental appointments across the country over the next 12 months.\nIn the longer term, around 240 dentists will be offered one-off payments of up to £20,000 for working in under-served areas for up to three years, helping to attract new NHS dentists and improve provision of care in areas with the highest demand.\nFurther measures include introducing a New Patient Premium payment to incentivise dentists to treat around a million new patients who have not seen an NHS dentist in two years or more.\nTo help improve access in the short term, new dental vans are being launched to help reach more isolated communities, including in rural and coastal areas.\nThe scheme will be introduced within weeks, ensuring that patients can benefit immediately.\nThe minimum value of activity will also increase from £23 to £28 and high-performing practices will be able to deliver extra work on top of their contracted activity, ensuring NHS work is more attractive to dental teams.\nExpanded prevention care is also being rolled out for younger children to help reduce tooth decay and improve the nation’s oral health through the ‘Smile for Life’ programme. Children at nursery and reception level will be offered vital preventative measures against tooth decay.\nThe Government will consult on wider reforms to the dental workforce and contract in 2024, taking the long-term decisions to ensure that dental services can be there for families for the years to come.\nCommenting, Caroline said:\n“I understand the frustration of people in Gosport when they need to see a dentist but who, since the pandemic, have struggled to get an NHS appointment.\n“In Gosport a third of adults and more than half of the children have accessed NHS dentistry in the last year, but there is still unmet need.\n“I am therefore delighted that the Conservative Government has published its NHS Dental Recovery Plan, creating 2.5 million more NHS dental appointments over the next year - exceeding the pledges made by Labour by over a million appointments.”\nHealth and Social Care Secretary, Victoria Atkins MP said:\n“Dentistry is a priority for this government. I know from my experience representing a rural and coastal constituency in Lincolnshire how frustrating it is for people who cannot get a dentist appointment, especially after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dentistry. We have seen big improvements over the past year, but now we are going much further.\n“I’m determined to deliver faster, simpler and fairer access to NHS dentistry for patients and this plan will help anyone who has not been able to see a dentist in the past two years to do so.“\n“The long term decisions we are taking will help ensure that good oral health is available to all, wherever you live and whatever your background.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

The majority of the projects are set to be completed in three to five years.\nEach school in the programme has been selected based on the condition of its buildings, making sure the greatest improvements are delivered for schools that need them the most and maximising children’s chances to gain the skills and knowledge they need.\nThe new buildings will be more energy efficient for future winter resilience, helping schools keep bills down and meeting our Net Zero commitments.\nSelected schools include primary, secondary, special schools, and 16-19 institutions, with over half of the successful schools in the Midlands and North, levelling up education across England.\nConstruction of new buildings at some of the previously announced schools is already underway, with a number of projects almost completed.\nAs well as delivering world-class learning environments for pupils, the School Rebuilding Programme will also create opportunities, jobs, and apprenticeships – from the construction industry to suppliers, businesses will be offering training as part of their involvement in the projects.\nCommenting, Caroline said:\n“The quality of facilities in schools can have a significant impact on a student’s learning and I have been working closely with the Conservative Government to secure investment in our schools to offer children the best opportunity to succeed.\n“That is why I welcome the news that Baycroft School will benefit from the latest round of the School Rebuilding Programme, backed by £1.8 billion in 2022–34 to rebuild and refurbish 239 more schools across the country, including updating and modernising.\n“This investment will improve the experience of students across the country – helping them to learn, develop, and achieve their full potential.”\nCommenting, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said:\n“Education is a top priority for this Government. That is why, despite facing challenging economic circumstances, we are investing a record amount in our schools and colleges. Today’s announcement will transform hundreds of schools across the country and ensure they are fit for the future.\n“The additional funding, alongside fantastic new facilities, will mean our brilliant teachers can get on with what they do best – and inspire the next generation.”\nENDS\nNotes to Editors\nThe Conservatives are delivering the world class education facilities our children deserve by:\n- Building new and improved facilities for 400 schools, giving more children the world class learning environment they deserve. The Conservative Government has announced the first 400 of 500 schools that will benefit from over £13 billion since 2015 to maintain and improve school facilities across England, including £1.8 billion this financial year, helping to build new facilities from classrooms and science labs, to sports halls and dining rooms (DfE, Press Release, 15 December 2022, link).\n- Providing £2 billion extra school funding this year and next, helping schools and colleges with the highest real terms spending on schools in history. 2024-25 will be the highest spending year in history for schools – the total the schools budget will be £58.8 billion in 2024-25, with the Conservative Government putting more into schools than ever before (DfE, Press Release, 6 December 2022, link).\n- Providing £500 million for energy efficiency upgrades for schools and colleges, helping them to save on their bills. On average, a primary school will receive approximately £16,000, a secondary school will receive around £42,000, and further education college groups will receive approximately £290,000 (DfE, Press Release, 6 December 2022, link).\n- Boosting schools and skills under the Levelling Up plans with 55 Education Investment Areas and extra funding and support for skills to Level Up across the country. Through the Levelling Up White Paper, the Conservative Government are targeting support to 55 areas across the country where school outcomes are weakest to target investment, support and action, including: retention payments to help keep the best teachers, new specialist sixth form free schools, and new reading, writing and maths targets (DfE, Press Release, 1 February 2022, link).",

This includes the most recent announcement by Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, that in the year 2024/25 the UK will increase its contribution by £200 million on the previous two years to £2.5 billion.\nThe United Kingdom has led the way in being the first country in the world to send main battle tanks to Ukraine, whilst the £200 million earmarked for drone procurement this year will make the UK the biggest drone partner with Ukraine. In total, the UK ranks third in the world for total support for Ukraine.\nAt home, since June 2022 more than 34,000 Ukrainian personnel have been trained in the UK, whilst just under 142,000 Ukrainians have arrived for safety in the UK via the Homes for Ukraine scheme.\nAccording to Government data, 140 visas have been issued under the Homes for Ukraine scheme for Gosport, whilst 4,040 have been issued for Hampshire.\nTo date, over 10,000 civilians have died as a result of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, with many more injured. The conflict shows no signs of coming to an end.\nMarking the two-year anniversary, Caroline said:\n“The UK has led the world in its support for Ukraine, with military, economic, and humanitarian aid. We have been generous, opening up our homes to displaced Ukrainians, and our training bases to Ukrainian soldiers. We’ve implemented the widest range of economic sanctions ever, going even further in recent days in light of the death of Alexei Navalny. We will continue to do all that it takes because we know that a fight for Ukraine, is a fight for democracy against Putin’s tyranny and global security. Ukraine and her courageous people are never far from our thoughts.\"\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Defence Secretary of State Grant Shapps said:\n“As this war drags into its third year, far from winning, Russia has been pushed back since those early days. Putin has achieved none of his strategic objectives, his invading force has suffered a staggering 356,000 casualties, and Ukraine has destroyed or damaged about 30% of the Russian Black Sea fleet and retaken 50% of the territory that Russia stole from it.\n“I am proud that, over the course of the past 730 days, Britain has been at the forefront of [the] global response.\n“We are giving Ukraine more of the help it needs, inflating its capabilities so that it can defend freedom’s frontline.

These independent lifeboats are run primarily (if not entirely) by volunteers, and funded by local donations. They provide an invaluable service to their local communities and save thousands of lives each year.\nNILA was founded by Anthony Mangnall MP following a visit to an independent lifeboat in his constituency of Totnes and South Devon. This visit highlighted the essential work of the UK’s independent lifeboats as well as the many challenges they face including funding, public awareness and long-term support. He has worked with colleagues in Parliament as well as industry experts to form the charity, which will now be able to offer independent lifeboats the support and recognition they desperately need.\nNILA has already welcomed twenty-nine members from all four nations, each of which work closely with their local Coastguard team, Police force or Fire service. The association’s official launch took place at the Emergency Services Show at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham on Wednesday 21st and Thursday 22nd September, where NILA had a stand and members attended the first AGM.\nMembers of NILA will retain their independence while enjoying benefits including greater representation in Parliament, promotion nationally, and access to working groups where data and best practice is shared. The association also aims to achieve recognition by the UK SAR Operators Group, joining the likes of the RNLI, Lowland Rescue (ALSAR), Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MR-EW), and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS).\nThe Department for Transport has previously confirmed it is supportive of NILA while the Maritime and Coastguard Agency has also welcomed the new association.\nDame Caroline said:\n“As an MP for a coastal constituency, I know how essential life boat stations are to the safety of our waterways. GAFIRS is a prime example of this, and a vital asset to our community, covering one of the busiest stretches of water along the UK coastline. It is right that these vital organisations, often made up of volunteers have a charity like the National Independent Lifeboat Association to support them.\nI look forward to working with NILA to support lifeboat stations up and down the country, improving safety on the water, and to support the incredible volunteers who make these organisations possible.”\nFounder and Honorary President of NILA, Anthony Mangnall MP (Totnes and South Devon), said:\n“After two years working together with the independent lifeboats of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, I am pleased to see our initiative come to fruition. This new association – NILA – will provide the access and information for our independent lifeboats to thrive over the years to come as well as ensuring our coastline has maximum lifesaving coverage.\nThe recognition of this association by the Department for Transport and UK Search and Rescue will ensure that independent lifeboats can speak with one unified voice while maintaining their independence.\nI look forward to ensuring that not only are our waterways safe for citizens across the country but that this association helps to support those incredible volunteers who do so much to help others”\nChair of NILA, Neil Dalton, said:\n“It is an honour to take on the role of Chairman of the National Independent Lifeboat Association. This organisation is, in my opinion, long overdue and has the potential to offer great support to many independent lifeboats around the UK.\n“Many members of the public assume that this water safety role is entirely the province of the RNLI, who provide an outstanding service. However, many areas of the UK are served by independent lifeboats so the National Independent Lifeboat Association intends to raise awareness of these organisations.”",

This support will last for 6 months, with discounts starting on 1 October.\nThe new Energy Bill Relief Scheme will provide a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices, fixing the price per unit for a 6 month period. The cost per unit is expected to be £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 per MWh for gas, far below the anticipated wholesale prices for this winter.\nThis discounted rate will apply automatically to fixed price contracts agreed on or after the 1 April 2022, with the discount starting from October 2022. Customers entering fixed price contracts after 1 October will also receive the same rate. Variable tariffs will also receive a per-unit discount, lowering the cost of bills although these may still be subject to price increases.\nA review of these measures will be launched in 3 months to help inform policy decisions for support after the 6 month period.\nCommenting on the announcement, Dame Caroline said:\n“It is great news to see that the Government is supporting local businesses by providing much needed security, by fixing energy prices to avoid the rises over the winter months. This announcement will ensure that businesses in Gosport, Stubbington, Lee on the Solent and Hill Head are able to stay profitable, protecting jobs and our local economy.”\n“By providing similar support given to household consumers, businesses and charities will be able to plan with greater certainty for the winter ahead. This is much needed support for the economy, both locally to the Gosport constituency and across the country.”\nPrime Minister Liz Truss said of the announcement:\n“I understand the huge pressure businesses, charities and public sector organisations are facing with their energy bills, which is why we are taking immediate action to support them over the winter and protect jobs and livelihoods.”\n“As we are doing for consumers, our new scheme will keep their energy bills down from October, providing certainty and peace of mind. At the same time, we are boosting Britain’s homegrown energy supply so we fix the root cause of the issues we are facing and ensure greater energy security for us all.”\nThe announcement has also been welcomed by industry. Kate Nicholls, CEO of UK Hospitality said:\n“This intervention is unprecedented and it is extremely welcome that government has listened to hospitality businesses facing an uncertain winter. We particularly welcome its inclusiveness – from the smallest companies to the largest - all of which combine to provide a huge number of jobs, which are now much more secure.”\n“The government has recognised the vulnerability of hospitality as a sector, and we will continue to work with the government, to ensure that there is no cliff edge when these measures fall away.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nNotes to editors:\nFor more information, please go to the government website: Government outlines plans to help cut energy bills for businesses - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)",
  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_local-housing-targets-impossible-say-conservative-mps/content_63.html": "Dame Caroline Dinenage, Member of Parliament for Gosport, has today penned a letter calling on the Government to rethink its ‘impossible’ top-down housing targets for Fareham and Gosport Borough Councils.\nAlongside Shadow Minister for Housing and Hamble Valley MP Paul Holmes, and MP for Fareham and Waterlooville Rt Hon Suella Braverman, Dame Caroline noted that the two local authorities that cover her Gosport constituency are seeing a fivefold increase in their housing targets.\nThose Councils are currently adding an average of 211 houses every year, but are required by Labour’s updated National Planning Policy Framework to jointly add 1242 houses annually. According to Annex 1 in the revised Framework the target will come into effect on 12 March 2025.\nThe letter compares the fivefold increase in housing targets in the Gosport and Fareham jurisdictions with Labour-controlled Southampton City Council’s housing targets, who have seen a 12% reduction as a result of Angela Rayner’s consultation.\nGosport in particular is extremely overdeveloped, with only the Strategic Gap, that Caroline has campaigned to maintain, standing in the way of total development. According to Gosport Borough Council’s draft Local Plan, the Borough is ‘over 80% built on’. The Strategic Gap currently serves to keep communities separate, maintain green space, and alleviate air pollution.\nHowever, under the proposals of the revised National Planning Policy Framework, if Councils are unable to verify a five-year supply of houses, decision makers are expected to approve development. An article from October stated that Gosport has “no idea where to build ‘extra’ new homes for government housebuilding targets”, prompting fears that the likely failure to hit inflated housing targets will result in a housebuilding free-for-all.\nDame Caroline Dinenage said:\n‘I am incredibly concerned about what the Government’s new housing targets mean for people in Gosport, Lee on the Solent, Stubbington, and Hill Head.\n‘There is very little land supply locally that these new houses can be built on. Utilising our brownfield sites may go some way to satisfying these monstrously high targets, but there is a long way to go to get these fit for development. In the meantime, I do not want to see our vital Strategic Gap bulldozed and tarmacked as an offering to this Labour Government – whilst Labour authorities get off scot-free.\n‘Our services are stretched, our roads are busy and polluted, and our towns lack green space. This number of new homes would be a catastrophe for local communities.’\nPaul Holmes, Shadow Minister for Housing and Member of Parliament for Hamble Valley, said:\n‘At the heart of these reforms is a deeply concerning trend: the sidelining of local authorities and communities. The Government promised in their manifesto that local authorities would have a central role in planning decisions. Yet, we are now seeing a shift away from this commitment.’\nRt Hon Suella Braverman, Member of Parliament for Fareham and Waterlooville, said:\n‘Fareham Borough Council has rightly committed to delivering more than their fair share of houses through the Welborne housing development.

The group, set up to enhance the wellbeing of patients and staff by visiting hospitals with their dogs, not only won the award but stole the show with their canine companions.\nMeanwhile in 2022 Caroline’s nominee Alice Hendy took home the NHS Rising Star Award. She came up with the idea of Ripple Suicide Prevention, which discretely intercepts harmful searches and provides signposting to 24/7, free mental health support.\nThis year, Caroline is calling for potential nominations in the following categories:\n- The Excellence in Healthcare: This award recognises individuals or teams who go above and beyond to improve outcomes and experiences for patients living with and beyond major health conditions or work to prevent them.\n- The Excellence in Mental Health Care Award: To the individual or team that has worked across organisational boundaries to develop new and effective services to help people living with mental health problems.\n- The Future NHS Award: This award seeks to highlight individuals, teams and organisations that are successfully embracing the opportunities that come from advances in medical technology, data, and connectivity.\n- The Nursing and Midwifery Award: This award is for any nurse or midwife, who has used their skills to ensure that patients experience care and compassion.\n- The Health Equalities Award: This award is for an individual or organisation that helps the NHS to do its bit by bringing together different groups and organisations to reduce health inequalities and prevent ill health in different communities.\n- The Excellence in Primary Care and Community Care Award: As the needs of patients and the wider NHS evolves, so does the role of these professionals, and this award seeks to recognise practitioners and teams in primary or community care that are working with patients to help them stay healthy and avoid long stays in hospital or being admitted in the first place.\n- The Excellence in Urgent and Emergency Care Award: This award seeks to celebrate the amazing work of our emergency care services across the country and we are looking specifically for nominees who have made improvements to how the NHS treats people who need urgent care in their areas.\n- The Excellence in Education and Training Award: This award recognises a team or individual that is leading the way in supporting the delivery of the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan through innovative approaches to education and training.\n- The Volunteer Award: Volunteers have supported patients and staff in the NHS since its creation, doing everything from sitting with patients who are anxious or alone, to helping to provide life-saving support after a cardiac arrest. This award recognises the crucial role of volunteers in improving our health and care.\n- The Lifetime Achievement Award: This award is for an individual who has worked within a health or care setting for 40 years or more who has left a legacy.\nHopeful for a third straight success in the Awards, Caroline said:\n“Almost everybody has a story to tell about a healthcare professional, team, or organisation that they feel should be rewarded for their efforts and care.\n“We have already had nominations but as the deadline has been extended due to popular demand I am once again calling for nominations.\n“We have had great local success over the last 2 years with these awards, and we can make it a hat-trick by recognising the folk who go the extra mile to improve our local health and care.”\nBackground Information:\n- The nomination process is open from 29th February 2024 until midnight, 26th April 2024. Caroline can only nominate once for each category, so must review submissions before the deadline and decide which to nominate where she has received too many.\n- After the nomination window close, nominations will be sent to the relevant NHS England teams for initial sifting. Successful nominations at this stage will then go forward to a regional panel comprised of senior regional NHS England representatives. The regional panels will each choose one nomination in each category to go forward to the national judging panel. A national judging panel will then score each of the shortlisted nominations and select an overall winner for each category.\n- Information on how to nominate is available at – https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhs-parliamentary-awards/how-to-nominate/\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_visit-sierra-leone-coalition-global-prosperity-and-international-rescue-committee/content_65.html": "As an MP I frequently received emails from local people on the subject of the UK’s international aid spending. Not enough…..Too much….Wrong priorities…..Wrong countries…..Everyone has an opinion, not always based on solid evidence. I’m almost certainly guilty of that too. So, when I was invited to join the Coalition for Global Prosperity and International Rescue Committee on a trip to Sierra Leone to see for myself how some of our UK aid money is spent, particularly on projects which support women and children, I decided it was time to educate myself.\nI didn’t know what to expect. By global standards Sierra Leone is a poor country - the last 30 years have not been kind to this former British colony. A brutal civil war, devastating Ebola outbreak and the Covid pandemic have all taken their toll. 36% of its population live in ‘extreme poverty’ (less than $2 US per day.)\nThe Saving Lives in Sierra Leone programme, funded by the UK tax payer via the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), supports the Government of Sierra Leone to increase access to quality reproductive, maternal, newborn, and adolescent health services. The International Rescue Committee (IRC)is the not for profit organisation who lead on this. Their work includes training and mentorship programs to improve standards of care and key services such as blood banks and family planning.\nWhen the project started in 2019, the country had an incredibly high maternal mortality rate of 717 per 100,000 and infant mortality rate of 122 per 1000. The work has already had a positive impact, reducing the maternal mortality rate to 443 per 100,000 by 2022, it continues to fall.\nOur trip took us 4 hours drive from the capital city of Freetown, along an unexpectedly decent highway funded by the Chinese state (I will return to this point later), to Gbaiima Songa Health Centre in the Kartomahum area, a rural community not far from the second largest city, Bo.\nIt’s hard to convey what I saw. A small team of remarkable local midwives offer the best possible level of care within the constraints of incredibly basic facilities. An old, cramped building, with intermittent electricity, unreliable running water and no toilet facilities. The Delivery Room just about accommodates two beds with little space to manoeuvre. The one set of delivery equipment (scalpels, forceps etc) has become quite blunt. I asked what women in labour might expect in the way of pain relief. The midwife attempted to reassure me - if things got really bad they could issue paracetamol.\nUK aid has helped up-skill and mentor these midwives, and provided solar electricity so they no longer have to support women who go into labour at night with the lights from their mobile phones.\nThe same day the IRC were also running a ‘blood-drive’ - with booming speakers blasting catchy dance music to attract local people to the Community Health Centre to donate blood. In the UK we often take for granted the vital blood supplies in our local hospitals which are key to saving lives. In Sierra Leone 1 in every 31 women under the age of 50 die of preventable illnesses, most commonly maternity issues like post-partum haemorrhage. Yet, until quite recently, if a patient needed blood they would have to take a family member into hospital with them to provide it. UK aid money is assisting IRC to build blood-bank supplies - in fact 35% of the blood stocks in Sierra Leone have been captured this way. And they are doing a great job persuading people in these rural communities to participate. We spoke to a local teacher who was giving blood because he realised how vital it would be to have sufficient supplies in the local hospital if his pupils were ever in need.\nThe following day we visited the major hospital in Bo and saw the maternity triage, delivery room, high dependency ward and operating theatre.\nOnce again I was struck by the professionalism and dedication of the staff, in unimaginable working conditions. 500 doctors cover the whole of Sierra Leone - about as many as the Portsmouth hospitals region. 50% of hospital staff are volunteers. Agnes, cheery and efficient in her starched white dress is the kind of Head Matron any hospital in the world would be lucky to have, she told us proudly how she had studied in the UK. Buildings are hot, cramped and crumbling, power-cuts common. Sometimes I receive angry emails equating the state of British hospitals to a developing country. From now on, I will firmly offer reassurance to the contrary.\nOur three day whistle-stop visit also took us to see women and girls protection and empowerment programmes in action. These projects challenge harmful traditional norms and increase opportunities for girls and women by supporting community members to combat practices such as early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), and denial of education.\nWe were welcomed to the village by a large gathering of brightly dressed women and girls, singing and dancing. We sat down to talk to them. We spoke of their dreams and aspirations…nursing, law, even a couple of politicians - although maybe that was just for my benefit! Yet so many of them were mothers while still children themselves. We met a nineteen year old widow, she already had three children. The Sierra Leone government have recently overturned legislation which prohibited pregnant girls from continuing their education, under a new ‘Radical Inclusion’ policy advocated by the country’s impressive, young Education Minister, David Sengeh (who we also met with). But in reality, the vast majority of older girls we met in this rural area were not able to attend Secondary school.\nThe IRC’s Girl Shine Program reflects the day-to-day realities that girls and young women face and helps mentor them with the life-skills to tackle them.\nReflecting on my short visit; Sierra Leone is a country bursting with potential - fertile land, abundant fishing waters, rich in minerals and natural resources, with long, white sandy beaches. Yet recent history has dealt this country and its 8million residents, blow after blow. I’ve never experienced poverty on this scale or such a determination from within to address it. In meetings with Ministers and others I was struck by the special bond they feel with the UK, not only as their biggest aid partner but our shared historical links. Waiting in the wings are the Chinese (remember that impressive highway?) who are building relationships and funding massive infrastructure projects across Africa, no doubt with a close eye on their natural resources. I saw for myself how UK aid saves and changes lives in the short term but also how it has the potential to help lift countries out of poverty and foster the strong partnerships across the globe. It’s a trip that will stay with me forever.",
  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_caroline-welcomes-announcement-infected-blood-compensation/content_38.html": "Dame Caroline Dinenage, Member of Parliament for Gosport, has today welcomed the announcement of a £10 billion compensation package for victims, following the Infected Blood Inquiry’s Final Report.\nToday Rt Hon John Glen, Paymaster General and Member of Parliament for Salisbury, set out the Government’s proposed scheme to Parliament, which involved the establishment of the Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA). Sir Robert Francis, a British barrister with experience of high-profile medical controversies, was named as the Chair of this body.\nThe Scheme operated by the IBCA will compensate for both past and future losses suffered as a result of infected blood. The total package is said to be worth around £10 billion. In the meantime interim payments of £210,000 will be made to living infected beneficiaries.\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a ‘wholehearted and unequivocal” apology to the victims of the scandal in a statement in the House of Commons.\nA few hours earlier, Sir Brian Langstaff, Chair of the Infected Blood Inquiry, presented the Inquiry’s Final Report at Central Hall in Westminster. The Report revealed a litany of failings across Government, stating that infections that led to deaths, illness, and suffering were caused needlessly, and many infections could have been prevented.\nCaroline was in the audience to hear his presentation, a heartbreaking recapitulation of failings stretching back decades.\nSir Brian concluded: “Every aspect of their [victims’] lives has been defined by their infections – childhood; education; career; leisure; relationships; marriages; home ownership; travel; finances; dreams and ambitions have been lost and relationships broken.”\nCaroline has long been a champion of the victims of the Infected Blood Scandal.\nIn a 2010 debate on Contaminated Blood and Blood Products in the House of Commons, Caroline spoke about a Gosport constituent who had died after contracting HIV and hepatitis C. At that debate Caroline called for fair compensation for victims and their families.\nIn a 2015 debate on Contaminated Blood, Caroline rose to raise the plight of victims, highlighting their betrayal by trusts, departments, and the Government.\nLast year, Caroline supported an amendment to the Victims and Prisoners Bill, tabled by Dame Diana Johnson, that narrowly passed a vote in the House of Commons. The amendment sought to establish a body to ensure compensation for victims within three months of the Bill passing.\nSpeaking at the presentation of the Infected Blood Inquiry’s Final Report, Caroline said:\n“The announcement of a compensation body for infected blood victims today is long overdue. Whilst it is welcome, it will be of very little solace to those who have lost loved ones in this horrific scandal, in my constituency and across the country.\n“There are so many lessons to be learned for present and future Governments, and I am glad that in the meantime the Prime Minister has issued a full apology on behalf of Governments stretching back decades.\n“I have been involved in this campaign since I was first elected on behalf of constituents who are impacted.\n“The Government has now set out its plan to deliver compensation to everyone affected by this scandal, and I hope that this is delivered fairly and swiftly.”\nIn his statement to Parliament, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:\n“Today is a day for the victims and their families to hear the full truth acknowledged by all and, in the full presence of that truth, to remember the many, many lost loved ones.\n“Justice demands action and accountability, so I make two solemn promises. First, we will pay comprehensive compensation to those infected and those affected by this scandal, accepting the principles recommended by the inquiry, which builds on the work of Sir Robert Francis. Whatever it costs to deliver the scheme, we will pay it.\n“Secondly, it is not enough to say sorry, pay long-overdue compensation and then attempt to move on. There can be no moving on from a report that is so devastating in its criticisms. Sir Brian and his team have made wide-ranging recommendations. We will study them in detail before returning to the House with a full response.\n“We must fundamentally rebalance the system so that we finally address the pattern, so familiar from other inquiries such as Hillsborough, where innocent victims have to fight for decades just to be believed.”\nAnnouncing the Infected Blood Compensation Authority, Paymaster General John Glen said:\n“Sir Brian could not have been clearer: it is not just the harm caused by the infections that requires compensation. The wrongs suffered by those affected must also be compensated for, so when a person with an eligible infection has been accepted on to the scheme, their affected loved ones will be able to apply for compensation in their own right.\n“That means that partners, parents, siblings, children, friends and family who have acted as carers for those who were infected are all eligible to claim.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nThe Final Report: https://www.infectedbloodinquiry.org.uk/.../inquiry-report\nThe Prime Minister’s Statement: https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-05-20/debates/8D4E9AA0-63AB-450C-875E-4A76D8076033/InfectedBloodInquiryReport#contribution-A4624744-53A3-47E7-891E-DC77088A8291\nInfected Blood Compensation Scheme Summary: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infected-blood-compensation-scheme-summary",
  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_gosport-mp-pushes-older-persons-commissioner/content_76.html": "Dame Caroline Dinenage, today asked for better rights for children to see their grandparents following parental separation in Questions to the Justice Secretary - she also pushed the Minister, Mike Freer MP, for the Government to appoint an Older Person's Commissioner.\nThe Gosport MP and former Justice Minister, stated that England should be following the lead of other UK Nations - Scotland who have an Older Person's Minister and Northern Ireland and Wales who both have an Older Person's Commissioner, in order that the issue of grandparental alienation, and a range of other vital matters affecting older people, can be better represented.\nCaroline asked Justice Minister Mike Freer:\n“We know that the bond with a grandparent can be one of the most precious relationships in a child's life, and yet so often in the adult wars of family breakdown, children are a weapon and actions by grandparents through the family court are incredibly expensive and quite frequently fruitless.\nWhat more can the Department do to give grandchildren that right to see their grandparents? And isn't it about time that we followed the example of Scotland, who have an Older Person's Minister and Northern Ireland & Wales, who have an Older Person's Commissioner, to take up issues just like this one?”\nWhilst the Minister responded advising that an Older Person’s Commissioner would be a matter for the Prime Minister he did add that legal aid eligibility extensions could help grandparents in guaranteeing their rights to access to grandchildren. He said:\n“If I could take the last point first, in terms of an Older Person’s Commissioner my Rt Hon. Friend may wish to take this up with the Prime Minister as I suspect that's well above my pay grade.\nIn terms of addressing the issue of access for grandparents it's well recognised that we recently extended the ability of legal aid for special guardianship orders which may well be accessible for grandparents to ensure that they get SGO’s to guarantee their rights of access.”\nCommenting, Caroline said:\n“This is something I intend to take up with Number Ten. There are 11 million people aged over 65 in England alone - we have an aging population, but no single voice to champion their interests, which often end up slipping through the net due to their cross-departmental nature.\nThere is a Children's Commissioner - but no one with the same legal powers to stand up for Older People.\nThe issue of intergenerational relationships is a case in point. The grand-parent - grand-child bond can be so precious and formative, and cause such distress on both parts when it becomes the collateral damage of a parental split.\nOther UK Nations have an Older Person’s Minister or Commissioner - we need an Older People and Ageing Commissioner in England, to act as an independent champion, to take on these issues and ensure that policy making across Government consider the needs of our older population.”\nCaroline has previously raised the issue of Grandchildren's rights after a meeting with former Lord Chancellor, Dominic Raab in the Ministry of Justice to explore the suggestion further. She has also raised this with the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Tom Pursglove, in March 2022 who said:\n“The Government understands the important role that grandparents often play in children’s lives – something that I can very much relate to through my own experiences growing up – and the stability they can provide particularly during times of divorce, separation or bereavement.\nI know she had a productive meeting with my Rt Hon Friend, The Deputy Prime Minister recently. This is a matter that is under active consideration at the moment, at pace, and we will revert to her as quickly as possible.”",

Caroline campaigned on this for many years, and secured high-level meetings with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, which delivered a vital £25.7m of Government funding. This 50mph, 3.5km road takes at least half of the daily 25,000 vehicles out of Stubbington Village.\nShe has also worked hard to improve public transport services in the area, promoting the Eclipse Bus scheme and working with local stakeholders to find solutions to the challenges posed by changes to local bus services. Following its success, the Eclipse Bus Route was extended 1km south to Rowner Road following Government funding. This extension opened in December 2021. The Government recently announced a Bus Service Improvement Plan, which will result in a greater frequency of busses between Gosport and Fareham.\nCaroline has previously submitted deputations to Hampshire County Council in support of preserving local bus routes and regularly meets with First Bus to discuss bus services in the local area including the impact of bus route changes on constituents. Caroline has welcomed the announcement that Gosport's waterfront will be transformed with funding from the government’s Brownfield Land Release Fund, including £1.25m for the bus station site as well as £850k for the depot. This will boost the local economy & attract visitors. Work has also recently been completed at the Esplanade, as part of the Bus Interchange project which will make it easier to travel around Gosport. The project is funded by money from the Government's Transforming Cities Fund.\nShe is pleased with the progress of cycle paths and walkways in our local area and wants to see these successes built on, with walking and cycling the natural choices for shorter journeys, or as part of a longer journey. Gosport Borough Council have a handy cycle route map to help plan your journeys on cycle paths.\nCaroline has called for faster train links between London and Portsmouth, holding a debate in Parliament to raise her concerns about transport infrastructure in the south coast. You can find this here.\nPromoting a more sustainable journey to work, Caroline led a successful campaign for the restoration of the entitlement to Home to Duty Travel Allowance for service personnel travelling to work on the Gosport Ferry, reducing congestion on key roads on and off the peninsula.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Caroline made numerous representations to the Secretary of State for Transport, and Junior Ministers, to provide financial support for the Gosport Ferry as passenger numbers plummeted due to the lockdown. Funding was secured thanks to Caroline’s intervention to enable the Ferry, as a vital piece of infrastructure, to continue to operate.",

The company was also accused of dodging scrutiny by employing opaque customer service practices.\nMartin King apologised for FirstPort’s record and laid out the company’s plans for improvement over the course of the hour-long meeting.\nThe group agreed to host a debate in Parliament to highlight the company’s failures, and hold a further meeting later in the year to track FirstPort’s progress on improvements for customers.\nFirstPort manage ten developments in the Gosport constituency.\nAfter the meeting, Caroline said:\n‘I am grateful to Mr King for coming to Parliament and for his recognition that FirstPort has not provided an adequate service.

In 2013, Caroline was appointed Small Business Ambassador for the South by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron.\nLocally, with 0.51 of a job per working adult in the Gosport peninsula, Caroline has made economic regeneration an absolute priority.\nWith 21% of the Constituency land owned by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), and multiple sites such as the Royal Clarence Yard and Fort Blockhouse up for disposal, Caroline has been putting pressure on the Ministry of Defence to ensure that site disposals will bring benefits to the local area.\nAs such, Caroline set up the Gosport Taskforce in 2016, where they discuss the disposal of military sites such as HMS Sultan and Fort Blockhouse. She has also been working alongside Berkeley Homes and the Royal Clarence Marina Residents Association to encourage business growth in Royal Clarence Yard and met with the MOD to ensure its suitable disposal. Frequently, Caroline raises the disposal of military sites in the House of Commons, most recently in March 2024 when she pressed for an update on the Fort Blockhouse site.\nIn addition to her work to bring an Enterprise Zone to the disused military airfield at Daedalus, she's been part of a number of successful Regional Growth Fund bids across the area including the 'Bridging the Gap' fund for small and medium businesses which secured over £4 million for local businesses.\nMore generally across Gosport, Hill Head, Stubbington and Lee-on-the-Solent, Caroline has campaigned for the regeneration of Waterfront having met with the British Retail Consortium, backed the Council's submission to the Portas Review, and helped secure £100,000 of funding from the Government. She also backed their bid to the £675 million Future High Streets Fund which aims to transform high streets and town centres. Caroline welcomed £18 million from the Levelling Up fund in November 2023 which will fund regeneration throughout Gosport and the council's Reconnecting Historic Gosport Waterfront project.\nWith the fantastic location of the Gosport Peninsula, Caroline is keen to further develop this location as a world-class yacht destination. In 2011 she was instrumental in the formation of the Gosport Marine Scene, bringing local businesses & organisations together to promote the area as a major marine and sailing destination on the south coast. This was expanded to include the wider Portsmouth Harbour area in 2019 and you can find out more about them here .\nThis continued growth is supported by Caroline's close work with Solent Partners spanning well over a decade. She is keen to ensure that Gosport, Stubbington, Hill Head and Lee-on-the-Solent are at the forefront of regeneration plans and consistently asks for updates on their progress and future plans. They frequently publish long-term strategy documents all of which can be found here. She has also previously Chaired and remains an active member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Central South, which serves as a crucial conduit for dialogue between regional MPs and business leaders.\nCaroline regularly meets with local employers – from major companies such as BAE and StandardAero to micro-businesses and has been a keen advocate of apprenticeships, supporting schemes at the CEMAST Centre, the Civil Engineering Training Centre and Huhtamaki, among others and is a supporter of Small Business Saturday.\nAcross the constituency, she has hosted various events for local entrepreneurs and businesses, including a Disability Confident conference, and hosts an annual Enterprise Fair during Enterprise Week. Caroline has also organised many events for senior school pupils and surrounding business. These included an 'Apprentice' inspired business & entrepreneurship workshop at Bay House School with Karren Brady as well as a celebration of Enterprising Womenat at Bridgemary School which welcomed Jacqueline Gold CBE and a cohort of successful local businesswomen from the local area.\nA study by GMB Southern found that whilst nationally full-time workers’ mean gross annual pay in 2018 was 86.4% of what it was in 2007, Gosport was one of only two areas who saw an earnings increase, standing at 110.9% of the figure in 2007. Caroline welcomed these findings, which showed the positive benefits of her actions to regenerate the Gosport economy.",

The Gosport Constituency has a proud history of serving the Armed Forces, home to more veterans than any other in our region, as well as key defence and aviation companies who play a vital role in keeping our nation safe.\nThe Defence Secretary first met with local WWII Veteran, 98-year-old Geoff Rushton. A long time Gosport resident, local Alderman and former Mayor. As Flt Lt Rushton, Geoff was a navigator with 15 Squadron at RAF Mildenhall and 186 Squadron at RAF Tuddunham. He discussed some of his memories of WWII with the Defence Secretary.\nDame Caroline took the Defence Secretary to visit StandardAero (formerly Fleetlands) who have been one of the key maintenance, repair and overhaul of military and commercial helicopters for decades - including Chinook. During the visit, he met many of the employees of StandardAero who carry out cutting vital work on the UK Army Air Corps’ (AAC) Gazelle AH Mk1 helicopter fleet as well as opening the recommissioned Chinook Hangar on the site.\nNigel Amphlett from StandardAero said:\n“Fleetlands is the most extensive aircraft Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul facility of its kind in Europe, and the largest employer in the Gosport region. With over half of the Fleetlands workforce dedicated to UK MOD helicopter maintenance support programmes it seemed fitting that we should have the pleasure of a visit from The Rt Hon Ben Wallace MP, Secretary of State for Defence, who was in the Gosport constituency as a guest of Caroline. The visit gave the management team at Fleetlands the opportunity to introduce the Secretary of State to some of the highly skilled and experienced workforce, brief him on the broad range of capabilities and services we can offer the defence customer, and let him see first-hand how StandardAero UK maintains, repairs and overhauls the Gazelle and Chinook helicopters.”\nSpeaking after the Minister's visit, Caroline said:\n\"Gosport has such as deep-rooted military history and it was important for the Defence Secretary to see how vital our area remains to the armed forces.\nIt was a pleasure to invite the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, to Gosport to meet with Geoff Rushton, who is a shining example of our proud story, as well as StandardAero who continue their vital work to make the world a safer place.”\nDefence Secretary, Ben Wallace said:\n“The important work being undertaken at Standard Aero to maintain our Gazelle and Chinook helicopters is supporting high quality jobs in Gosport and high quality services to our armed forces. It was a pleasure to open their recommissioned Chinook hangar.\nMeeting Geoff on the way was also incredibly poignant. Another great reminder of the incredible courage of our WWII Veterans and why the brave men and women fighting for the same freedoms today in Ukraine deserve our total support.”",

One of those individuals was released early from prison on licence in September, following a two-year sentencing for a previous conviction of wounding with intent.\nCaroline raised her concerns in Business Questions as to how the accused suspect was able to be released on license, and able to commit this murder.\nShe asked the Leader of the House for a debate on His Majesty’s Prison and Probate Service and their decision-making process to release on licence. The Leader of the House confirmed that the Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, Alex Chalk, was aware of the tragic case and will be in touch with Caroline to discuss a review.\nSpeaking in the debate, Caroline asked the Leader of the House:\n“Could we have a debate on HM Probation and Prison Services decisions to release on licence? Last Friday, my constituent Levi Kent was stabbed to death. The man charged with his murder was sentenced to two years in prison for wounding with intent in January of this year, and was released on licence in September.\n“Would my Rt. Hon. Friend back my calls for a Serious Case Review into the licencing decision and monitoring, which may have freed someone who should be in prison, to murder.”\nThe Leader of the House of Commons, the Rt. Hon. Penny Mordaunt, responded:\n“I’m sure that I speak for the whole House when I say how appalled we are to hear of this situation, and our thoughts are with my Rt. Hon. Friend’s constituents, and all affected by that appalling tragedy.\n“I know that the Lord Chancellor is aware of this particular case. I am sure that it would need to be subject to a review to see what has happened in this instance.\n“I know that the Lord Chancellor’s door is always open to the Hon. Lady, and I think he may have already contacted her about this and I thank my Hon. Friend for all she is doing in her constituency in the aftermath of this appalling event.”\nSpeaking after Business Questions, Caroline said:\n“The tragedy of Levi’s death is made all the more heart-breaking by the fact that one of the men charged with the murder should have been in prison. Clearly, there are questions to answer about how he came to be released so early on licence, given he was sentenced for a violent crime less than a year ago, and what measures were in place to manage him upon release.\n“I have spoken to the Justice Secretary to make him aware of this case, and will be writing to him to ask for a Serious Case Review into this matter.\n“Of course, my thoughts remain with Levi’s family and friends.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nNotes to editors:\n-To watch a clip of Caroline’s question, please go to https://fb.watch/oEkRdO7toW/ or on Parliament Live TV (https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/5013c0a3-7b89-42d1-9da4-b662edaea521)",

Work began on this pledge at the last ONS census in 2021 which, for the first time ever, recorded the number of veterans living in the UK and where they lived.\nThe government have already shown a consistent commitment to veterans, with the Prime Minister re-appointing Rt Hon Johnny Mercer MP as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, a role which now attends cabinet, as well as introducing the new veterans’ ID cards as part of the discharge process.\nThe findings of this survey will be invaluable to the Office of Veteran Affairs & other government organisations, charities and public bodies. It will help to inform and shape future policy decisions and support networks, as well as provide greater understanding of the veterans community.\nIt is also open to family members of veterans. The survey is available on the ONS website.\nDame Caroline Dinenage said:\n“The Gosport constituency has a very high proportion of Armed Forces veterans. I am glad that the government is delivering on its pledge to make the UK the best place to be a veteran by 2028.\n“The information collected by this ONS survey will be incredibly valuable to policy and decision makers.

Under the CEA scheme families have to pay at least 10 percent of fees themselves, but this has not kept pace with the rate of school fees rises.\nThe policy, credited with the closure of nine independent schools already since its announcement, is expected to cost the British taxpayer £1.6 billion a year.\nHowever, the Government has produced no impact assessment to suggest either how much money they expect this tax to raise or the groups of people it might disproportionately effect – yet they are still rushing ahead to introduce this tax part way through this academic year.\nAnticipating struggles for many families in Gosport, Caroline said:\n“My inbox has been full of parents who are concerned about the detrimental impact of this policy on their children. These are not wealthy parents, but those who have scrimped and save to make sure their child’s educational setting was the right one for them.\n“The effect on a neurodivergent child of being in the wrong education setting can be devastating. Parents of children with SEND are concerned that mainstream education will lead to their children regressing and disengaging from education.\n“But by pricing those parents out of specialised independent schools, that is exactly what these Labour VAT proposals will cause to happen.”\nCommenting, Shadow Education Secretary Damian Hinds said:\n“All education and training provision is exempt from VAT. Labour’s Education Tax is a worrying development that could be a slippery slope. We are against this retrograde step.\n“The impact of the Education Tax could see thousands of pupils move to state schools, increasing class sizes and disruption for teachers and pupils, increasing costs for the taxpayer and ultimately making it less likely that parents will secure a place at their preferred choice of school. Labour have said the prospect of larger class sizes in the state sector is “fine”; we disagree.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

Interconnectors like IFA2 connect the UK to neighbouring countries to enable the lowest cost exchange of excess zero carbon energy. They also give system operators the ability to react quickly to rapid changes in supply and demand resulting from the growth of intermittent renewable generation. By 2030, we estimate that 90% of electricity imported via National Grid’s interconnectors will be from zero carbon sources. To show the huge impact our existing three interconnectors are already having, we’ve built an interactive tool that reveals, in real time, how they’re helping to reduce carbon emissions - Power of Now carbon dashboard.”\nCommenting, Caroline said: ‘’It has been so interesting to visit the IFA2 site today and great to have a such an informative tour from Craig. IFA2 is projected to power up to 1 million homes with zero-carbon power and this is a great opportunity for the Gosport constituency to play a huge part in the UK’s net-zero carbon emissions target. It is fantastic too to hear about the jobs that building this project has created for local workers, as well as the investment in the area from the 400-strong team on the site’’.",

In January 2022 Caroline raised the matter in Prime Minister’s Questions and in April 2022 she secured the first ever childhood cancer debate in the House of Commons. The Taskforce was established by the Conservative Government in February 2024.\nInitial sprints with experts in research, treatments and diagnostics took place in the spring and the first deliverable action points were agreed.\nHowever, a Government response on 6 September to a Written Question (UIN 2283) posed by Caroline signalled the Government’s intention to pause the work of the Taskforce, prompting parents of children with cancer to describe their response to the decision as “deeply disturbed”.\nThe Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Wes Streeting, said at the time:\n“I would be delighted to meet her to talk about the genesis of the task force and how we can take forward the outcomes that she wants to see.\n“What we are trying to avoid is a plethora of task forces, and the risk that we’ve sometimes seen – and this is not a party political point, because this spans successive governments – of task forces being an alternative for action.”\nNow, a National Cancer Plan to be published this year will set out targeted actions to reduce lives lost to one of the biggest killers, continue improving survival rates, and improve the experience of patients along their cancer journey.\nIt will also include specific actions for rarer cancers such as those affecting children.\nThe Taskforce will support this work, with Caroline and Professor Darren Hargrave appointed as its co-chairs, alongside Dr Sharna Shanmugavadivel as vice-chair.\nSubsequent meetings later this year will confirm the work programme.\nCo-Chair of the Children and Young People Cancer Taskforce, Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said:\n“On World Cancer Day, it should escape nobody’s attention that cancer is the biggest cause of death by illness for children under 14 in the UK.\n“So I am thrilled that it has been confirmed that the Taskforce will resume its vital work improving the way we detect, treat and care for children and young people with cancer.”\nShadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the Rt Hon Edward Argar MP, said:\n“I very much welcome the re-launch of the Children and Young People’s Cancer Taskforce which is an important step toward improving cancer care for younger people. It brings together experts to create a unified approach for better treatment, support, and outcomes. By focusing on the unique needs of children and young people, the taskforce will aim to ensure that these patients receive world-leading, innovative care.\n“This Taskforce was first launched last year under the previous government and whilst it was suspended following the General Election, I am pleased it will be able to continue its valuable work now under the Co-Chairmanship of Dame Caroline Dinenage MP and Professor Darren Hargrave.”\nFounder of Sophie’s Legacy, Charlotte Fairall, said:\n“Sophie’s Legacy welcomes the government’s relaunch of the Children and Young People’s Cancer Taskforce as a vital step towards improving outcomes for young cancer patients across the UK.\n“Too many children and young people face devastating delays in diagnosis, limited treatment options, and a lack of tailored support during and after their cancer journey. Sophie’s Legacy has worked tirelessly for over three years with the government to create change for children and young people with cancer.\n“We urge the government to ensure this taskforce delivers meaningful action—faster diagnosis, better treatments, and dedicated support services for children, young people, and their families. We look forward to working collaboratively with policymakers, healthcare professionals, and other charities to turn promises into progress.\n“Every child deserves the best possible chance at life. Let’s make this relaunch count.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

It was visited over 870,000 times last year.\nShe was shown around the Museum by Chief Executive of Portsmouth Naval Base Property Trust Hannah Prowse, and Jason Webb, Deputy General Manager of the National Museum of the Royal Navy, who run the site in partnership with the Mary Rose Trust.\nAfter the visit to the Explosion Museum of Naval Firepower, Caroline said:\n“Tourism is vital to our local economy, providing the money that protects and safeguards the heritage that Gosport is lucky to be so steeped in.\n“I would recommend planning a visit to Priddy’s Hard this weekend to anyone from our area and beyond! English Tourism Week is a great opportunity to shout about what Gosport and the waterfront has to offer, as well as the wider Historic Dockyard that we are all rightly so proud of.\n“Plan a visit and don’t forget to post under the hashtag #EnglishTourismWeek24, so we can welcome as many people to Gosport as we can.”\nTourism Minister Julia Lopez said:\n“This week we celebrate the incredible job our tourism industry does showcasing England to the world - from our breathtaking landscapes and coastline to the treasure trove of heritage, culture and cuisine to be found in our towns, villages and cities.\n“Tourism adds billions of pounds to the economy while supporting millions of jobs, and we are helping the sector grow from strength to strength through our Tourism Recovery Plan. But we can all play our part, which is why I encourage everyone - throughout English Tourism Week and beyond - to explore all that our fantastic country has to offer.”\nVisitEngland Director Andrew Stokes said:\n“As the weather turns warmer and with Easter up ahead, now is the time to put tourism centre stage and showcase this wonderful industry which supports millions of jobs and communities across England.\n“England’s tourism industry has something for everyone and ETW sets the scene with season openings, resident festivals and free events showcasing our contemporary culture, heritage, stunning coastline, rolling countryside and vibrant cities, available to all at every budget.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

It is designed to protect and improve people’s access to culture, level up local cultural venues, and use investment to promote economic growth.\nThe £20.5 million Libraries Improvement Fund will transform library services in England to upgrade their builds and improve digital infrastructure. This is the second round of the fund with 25 projects already benefiting from £5 million of funding in the first round.\nThis announcement follows a big boost for the cultural sector from the Conservative Government in the Spring Budget with an extension of tax reliefs for theatres, orchestras, and museum and gallery exhibitions for a further two years. These tax reliefs have already supported thousands of theatres and orchestral productions, galleries and museums across the country, and the extension is set to help the cultural sector continue to attract new talent and investment from home and abroad.\nCommenting on the news, Caroline said:\n“I am delighted to see such a large investment being made to Bridgemary Library. This will go a long way to safeguarding access to culture and the libraries services for years to come.\nI know that libraries are cherished hubs of the community, and I am pleased that the government is supporting them to adapt to the new digital landscape.\nThis funding injection will go a long way to reinvigorating and encouraging access to library services in the constituency.”\nCommenting, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said:\n“This investment will help to level up access to arts and culture for everyone, no matter where they live.\n“Culture helps us create lifelong memories with our families and friends, provides entertainment and joy, and allows us to explore the world around us in new and exciting ways. It can also boost tourism, support local business and drive local economic growth.\n“This funding will support brilliant arts organisations to upgrade their venues and create new projects that will be at the heart of their communities.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nNotes to editors:\n-To find out more about the announcement, please go to: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/over-70-cultural-venues-museums-and-libraries-supported-with-60-million-boost?deliveryName=DM20176&deliveryName=DM20199",

She believes it is vital that we protect this land as a stretch of countryside that keeps communities distinct and prevents urban sprawl, whilst providing valuable green space to the local community.\nWhile understanding that we need new houses, Caroline believes that they should first and foremost be built on brownfield sites not green spaces, which are increasingly few and far between in the Solent region. She has strongly urged Fareham Borough Council to maintain the area between Gosport, Fareham and Stubbington as a strategic countryside gap, as outlined in their previous Local Plan.\nMany of these proposed developments have been right on the border with the Gosport Borough, with access points through Gosport and using Gosport infrastructure and amenities. Gosport as a Borough is 72% built on, as opposed to the national average of 6%, and Caroline believes that developing homes in the strategic gap would create excessive pressure on our already overburdened roads.\nIn 2017, Fareham Borough Council were flagged as one of the 23 councils that need to tackle dangerous air pollution levels. Caroline believes that any housing development in the strategic gap would add to the air pollution levels in the area affecting the health and wellbeing of local residents.\nShe is also concerned about the pressures that developments within the strategic gap would further put on our already pressured schools, community facilities, dental practices and GP Surgeries.\nCaroline has formally objected to both Fareham Borough Council and developers on a number of housing proposals in the Strategic Gap as well as Fareham's Draft Local Plan. She is committed to protecting the strategic gap and will continue to campaign against any future plans to use this valuable green space for housing developments.\nCaroline has also objected to a number of housing developments which have threatened green space within the Constituency. Most recently, she was disappointed with the independent Planning Inspectorate’s decision on Persimmon Homes application\nCaroline has welcomed the announcement of the Daedalus Development Company who will lead the development of the Daedalus Waterfront Site at Lee on the Solent. After a long tender process, Homes England has confirmed that Murray Twohig Development, Orwell Real Estate and Patron Capital, will undermine the redevelopment of the waterfront part of the disused military airfield site of former RNAS Daedalus. The development will include the restoration of historic buildings, new employment and commercial units, alongside community spaces such as a public park in Seaplane Square.\nCaroline has previously met with the Minister for Housing to discuss how this will affect locl infratructure, with Gosport Borough Council bosses joined her to seek reassurance that the investment will deliver infrastructure to support wider commercial development and job creation at the Daedalus waterfront site.",
  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_campaigns_health-and-social-care/content_2.html": "Caroline is passionate about protecting local health and care resources, having been the Minister of State for Care and Mental Health from 2018 - 2020.\nShe frequently fights successfully for local healthcare provision, such as when she secured the reopening of Blake Maternity Unit at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital in early 2011. She has since supported the Children's Heart Unit at Southampton Hospital, met the local Clinical Commissioning Group, visited the War Memorial Hospital, Queen Alexandra Hospital (QA) and local GPs and other healthcare providers. She regularly meets with staff and management at QA to raise constituents' concerns and keep updated with developments at the site.\nAfter a discussion with the Chief Executive of QA in early 2018 about the state of the A&E facilities, Caroline suggested that they bid for the STP Capital Scheme and subsequently the hospital put forward a proposal for redevelopment of their emergency floor. Caroline lobbied the Minister of State for Health to highlight the importance of this £58.2 million bid, which was not only successful but would also secure a long-term solution to the overstretched service, improving patient safety and ambulance waiting times. Caroline welcomed the news in March 2022 that the brand-new Emergency Department at Queen Alexandra Hospital had received full planning permission from Portsmouth City Council. She met with Health Secretary Victoria Atkins in January 2024 to bring attention to concerns about QA and visited the hospital a few days later to monitor the progress of the multi-million pound Emergency Department expansion.\nIn June 2022 Caroline hosted then-Health Minister Maria Caulfield in Gosport to discuss what changes can be made to improve access to NHS dentistry locally. Recently, she visited the brand-new Portsmouth University Medical School and Portsmouth Dental Academy, where graduates and students on placement will contribute to fulfilling the needs of local people.\nCaroline has a strong record of campaigning for improved health outcomes. In 2021, Caroline was contacted by a constituent, Charlotte Fairall, whose daughter Sophie had tragically passed away from a rare form of cancer at just 10 years old. Sophie created a bucket list with the aim of improving the experiences of children and their families who find themselves in a similar position to herself. Caroline secured the first ever debate on childhood cancer in the House of Commons in April 2022, and after years of tireless campaigning was announced as the Chair of the newly-established Children and Young Person Cancer Taskforce, in February 2024. The first \"sprints\" - meetings bringing together a wide range of stakeholders in the childhood cancer field - of that Taskforce took place in March 2024. Charlotte and Caroline are determined to continue this remarkable work in Sophie's memory.\nWhilst a Minister, Caroline introduced the Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training for health and social care staff, which improved the understanding of the needs of those with autism or learning difficulties among healthcare workers. She hosted a Westminster Hall debate in November 2023 calling for the training to be introduced in education settings, following the training's success.\nCaroline frequently meets with the various leaders of healthcare service providers for the Gosport area. This includes:\n- The leaders of the NHS's Vanguard programme, for which Gosport was chosen as a provider. This project has delivered the Same Day GP Access Service at Gosport War Memorial Hospital where a Multi-Speciality Community Provider Hub has been established, integrating different healthcare specialists into one centralised location.\n- Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust leadership team, in response to concerns raised by the Care Quality Commission, who update Caroline regularly on progress after past mistakes.\n- The Willow Group, Fareham and Gosport Clinical Commissioning Group, the partners at Stubbington Surgery, and Southern Health NHS Trust, all regarding GP Access. In the case of Stubbington Surgery, Caroline met to help find a solution to the cramped conditions at the practice.\n- Eight local healthcare organisations in May 2019, as part of a Health Forum to give Gosport constituents a unique opportunity to hear the latest updates and air their views on everything from dentistry to emergency care and ambulances to smoking cessation services.\n- Nursing home staff, owners, and residents from across Gosport, Lee-on-the-Solent, Stubbington, and Hill Head (Caroline also participates in the annual National Care Home Open Day)\nIn May 2014, Caroline abseiled down the Spinnaker Tower and in 2012 undertook a parachute jump to raise funds for the Gosport & Fareham branch of the MS Society.\nSupporting people living with dementia is something that is very close to Caroline’s heart and in 2015 she became a Dementia Friend, holding a number of training sessions in her local office. She is now a Dementia Friend Champion and has participated in the Alzheimers Society Memory Walk. Caroline also works closely with Dementia Friendly Hampshire to help make Fareham and Gosport Dementia Friendly.\nWith the launch of British Heart Foundation's Public Access Defibrillators scheme in 2015, Caroline called on local groups to take advantage of the defibrillator kits and CPR training on offer. As a result, life-saving equipment has been installed at a number of locations across the constituency.\nThe Government’s continued investment into mental health, including in schools, is welcomed by Caroline. In 2018, it was announced that Mental Health services will receive an additional £2.3 billion per year as part of the NHS five-year funding offer, including dedicated mental health teams in schools. In 2024/25, the Government expects that NHS England will meet the Mental Health Investment Standard, which requires Integrated Care Boards to increase their investment in mental health services in line with their overall increase in funding for the year.\nCaroline has campaigned to bring greater fairness to the IVF guidelines implemented by the local Clinical Commissioning Group which means that couples in the Gosport and Fareham area cannot access the levels of IVF treatment they would be entitled to in other parts of the UK.\nCaroline has actively raised awareness on behalf of diabetes and cancer charities both locally and nationally in recognition of their valuable work to tackle these dreadful diseases and support those affected. She joined in the WearAHatDay event with children from Alverstoke Infant School to help raise the profile of the Brain Tumour Research charity.\nAs Minister, Caroline announced that over 100 NHS hospitals will be able to build Changing Places facilities backed by a £2 million Government fund. Caroline is pleased that across the Gosport constituency a number of Changing Places Facilities have been installed or are planned.\nSince being elected Caroline has continued to support the families of those who died at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital between 1988-2000 to access the truth of what happened to their loved ones. In June 2018, the Gosport Independent Panel published their report into these deaths. The Department of Health & Social Care have put in place a support package for those affected by events at the Gosport War Memorial – call 01132545290 or email: [email protected].\nIn Parliament, Caroline co-Chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Carers. She spoke in favour of a Government amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill which will ensure that carers are consulted when a patient they care for is discharged from hospital. This places a new duty on NHS hospital trusts in England to ensure that unpaid carers are involved as soon as feasible when plans for the patient’s discharge are being made. The amendment covers all carers of adults needing care and support following hospital discharge, including health care support. This means that young carers looking after adults would also be covered. She also supported the Carers Leave Bill through the Commons which made provision for unpaid carers to take up to a week's unpaid leave, making it easier for carers to balance work and care commitments.\nIn addition to this Caroline often highlights health and social care issues in the Chamber, through OPQs, interventions and speaking in debates.",

Hon. Johnny Mercer MP, in Gosport to meet with a number of veteran-run businesses and support organisations.\nCaroline and Johnny visited FirstLight Trust, who provide a café hub for the veteran community giving a safe space to socialise and build a network with other veterans. They have hubs in a number of locations, including Gosport High Street.\nFinally, Caroline and the Minister met with a number of veteran-run businesses in the FirstLight Trust Café, of which Gosport has so many. Some of these included: Explorer Coffees, Powder Monkey, Solent Mobility, RE5 Customs, Port and Lemon & Tin Trousers. This gave the Minister the opportunity to learn about some of the challenges and barriers to entry of leaving the Armed Forces and starting businesses. He also met with Climb2Recovery who provides climbing courses for veterans, improving physical and mental well-being alongside Shore Leave Haslar who offer veterans an opportunity to come together and rehabilitate through horticulture.\nIn the Autumn Statement this week, the Chancellor announced an additional £10 million to support the Veterans’ Places, People and Pathways Programme (VPPP) to increase support to a significant community of vulnerable veterans throughout the UK and enable it to become self-sustaining.\nThe VPPP Programme awards grants to organisations across the UK working regionally to develop better, more joined up lasting support for local veterans with mental health needs. The funding will be administered via the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust.\nCommenting after the visit, Caroline said:\n“As we know, Gosport has the highest proportion of Veterans compared to any other constituency in England and Wales. It is so important that the Veterans’ Minister comes and visits some of our veteran community to hear about the challenges they have faced, and how government can help.\n“Johnny’s goal is to make the UK the best place in the world to be a Veteran. I am glad that a number of veteran-run businesses and support organisations in Gosport have had the chance to share their experiences to help make this goal a reality.”\nVeterans' Minister Johnny Mercer said:\n\"Gosport does so much for the veteran community nationally, which is why I was delighted to meet a number of local organisations who carry out vital work to support this thriving veteran community as well as a number of leading veteran businesses.\n\"During my visit I was proud to speak of the additional £10 million funding I secured in the Autumn Statement to foster collaboration between charities and service providers, and improve support for veterans.\"\nDorinda Wolfe Murray, CEO of FirstLight Trust\n“FirstLight Trust in Gosport leads the way in how veterans can be supported into living a meaningful, enjoyable life within their communities, through targeted case work, a meaningful programme of activities and the support and encouragement of those within their local community.\n“I am delighted that Caroline has brought the Minister of State for Office of Veterans Affairs to see and support the work we do, at the front line of veteran ‘need’. In particular, around our work in preventing homelessness, supporting partners and families and reducing loneliness and isolation. FirstLight’s hospitality in the cake and coffee field is legendary – as are the quiz nights and Christmas dinners. Perhaps the OVA should consider fielding a team??”\nNeil Hallsworth Director Explorer Coffees said:\n“It’s been an ideal time to discuss opportunities for Veterans starting and running businesses, at a similar scale to Explorer Coffees, and exchanging ideas on how the Ministry can support Veteran Owned Companies into the future.”\nJoe Winch, Climb2Recovery said:\n“Climb 2 Recovery is a wonderful community of friends, who have fun and laugh together; we accept people regardless of ability, disability or adversity; we have regular and great adventures; and climbing affords us valuable respite, time to heal and to find a healthier perspective and outlook.\n“This is why Climb 2 Recovery is so unique and our members so frequently describe their experience with us as transformative or life- changing. It’s also why I am so proud to have the opportunity to share our story with Minister of State for Veterans’ Affairs, Johnny Mercer MP, and Dame Caroline Dinenage MP.”",

Businesses such as British Gas, Citizens Advice Gosport, Connect To Support Hampshire, EDF, HSBC, Gosport Food Partnership, Nationwide Building Society, Portsmouth Water, Smart Energy GB and Southern Water all attended to offer constituents useful advice and information. Caroline plans to organise a similar event again in the future. She also organised and hosted a public meeting with Southern Water and the Environment Agency where they discussed the work they are doing to improve our water quality and constituents had the opportunity to ask questions of both organisations.\nCaroline has welcomed the cost of living support announced by the Chancellor in the 2022 Spring Budget. This included the decision to cut fuel duty by 5% - Caroline has previously met with major energy companies and lobbied ministers for action to tackle rising prices, standing up in the House of Commons on a number of occasions to express her opposition to fuel duty increases. Further to this the National Insurance reduction, doubling the household support fund and VAT relief will make a profound difference to many households.\nCaroline was also pleased that the Government announced in early 2022 to provide support with Energy Bills. This included:\n- A £200 ‘smoothing’ rebate on energy bills for all households\n- A non-repayable £150 cash rebate for homes in Council Tax bands A-D – equivalent to 80 per cent of all households, helping both lower and middle income families.\n- £144 million of discretionary funding for local authorities to support households not eligible for the council tax rebate.\nCaroline welcomes the positive movement towards renewable energy. In particular, the Government’s British Energy Security Strategy announced in April 2022 which sets out how Great Britain will accelerate the deployment of wind, new nuclear, solar and hydrogen, whilst supporting the production of domestic oil and gas in the nearer term – which could see 95% of electricity by 2030 being low carbon.\nCaroline, believes that creating a better charging network for electric cars will play a vital role in improving air quality. She is pleased that local companies are installing rapid chargers available for use by electric vehicle drivers.\nIFA2\nNational Grid have started a major new energy infrastructure project linking the UK's electricity network to France, with proposals for the UK connection point being located on the Stubbington side of the Daedalus site. The project is called IFA2 (Interconnexion France-Angleterre 2).\nCaroline shares constituents concerns about the interconnector being located at Daedalus and first met with National Grid in November 2015. Since then, in a quest for answers to local residents' queries, she has had numerous meetings and correspondence with the Project Director.\nWhen National Grid submitted a planning application to Fareham Borough Council, Caroline wrote to formally state her opposition to the plans. Caroline also raised her concerns with the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.\nOn 23 January 2018, Fareham Borough Council’s planning committee approved the application, Caroline joined residents from both Fareham and Gosport to make deputations at the meeting.\nIn its first 12 months of operation (from Janiary 2021), it has saved 300,000 tonnes of carbon by importing zero-carbon electricity generated by nuclear power from France.",

The redevelopment of the Bus Station site as a high quality mixed use development incorporating a landmark building has been in the pipeline for many years with a new efficient transport interchange for residents, workers and visitors to be provided.\nThe investment is being provided through the Transforming Cities Fund, which aims to overhaul local transport links to better connect communities, providing greater access to cities and towns as well as boosting the local economy.\nCaroline commented:\n“It is fantastic to see over £55 million being invested in our local region.\n“Our bus stop and taxi rank were in desperate need of redevelopment, and I know that this will be welcome news for many local residents who want to see our local transport networks improved.”\nIn Portsmouth itself, the Council has proposed using the funding to provide new bus lanes and links around the city.\nTransport Minister, Baroness Vere said:\n“This money will make a real difference to the everyday lives of Portsmouth and South East Hampshire residents.\n“The Transforming Cities Fund allows cities across the UK to enhance their local transport networks, opening up access to jobs and services.\n“We’re committed to levelling up transport infrastructure across the country, boosting local economies and enhancing local connectivity.

In fact since 2019 the high-needs budget has been increased by over 60 percent. Furthermore since 2010, the Conservative Government has delivered 60,000 more special needs places, opening 108 new schools, with a further 92 on the way.\nAlongside the Education Secretary’s announcement, Baroness Barran, Minister for the School System and Student Finance, announced that the Government had approved Solent Academies Trust’s application to run Whiteley Academy. The free school will offer specialist education for 135 pupils aged 4 to 18 with Severe Learning Difficulties (SLD).\nCommenting, Caroline said:\n“I know from my work on improving Autism training in education settings how essential it is that children and young people with special educational needs receive the right support in ann appropriate learning environment.\n“I am pleased that the Government are investing over £26 million to ensure that Hampshire can meet the needs of children with SEND, I know it will be welcomed by many families in the Gosport area and across the country.”\nCommenting, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said:\n“Today we are taking another step to ensure our education system provides all children with the very best start in life.\n“We are making sure no parent has to battle to get the right type of school to meet their needs, and improving the school estate so all children are taught in the best classrooms for generations to come.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

When in government, we issued guidance to try to ban smartphones from the classroom, but the latest evidence is clear that they are still far too prevalent in schools.\n“To fix the problem, the guidance needs to be put on a statutory footing. Does the Education Secretary agree that children’s educational outcomes are negatively affected by smartphones, and if she does, will she back our amendment to ban them from the classroom for good?”\nNow, Caroline is seeking the views of parents in Gosport, Lee on Solent, Stubbington and Hill Head, as to whether they believe that their child’s academic performance is being negatively affected by the presence of mobile phones in the classroom, and social media more generally.\nOver recent years, a body of evidence has formed that draws a link between poor mental health and smartphone usage. Last year, leading psychologist and bestselling author, Professor Jonathan Haidt endorsed a Policy Exchange report that examined that link and considered the effectiveness of smartphone bans in schools as a pragmatic and preventative policy intervention. The report claimed that only 11 per cent of secondary schools have an “effective ban” on mobile phones in the classroom.\nUrging parents to take part in her survey, Caroline said:\n“As the scientific evidence on the impact of smartphones on our children’s mental health and educational attainment continues to stack up, it’s imperative that the voices of parents contribute to the debate.\n“I am genuinely interested to hear what the experience of parents is with their children’s relationship to technology, especially smartphones. While a recent poll suggested that 60 per cent of people in Britain think smartphones should be banned in schools, I want to see whether that is reflected locally.\n“This is an opportunity for parents across Gosport, Lee on the Solent, Stubbington and Hill Head to play a direct role in my work in Parliament by informing my views, so I would encourage everyone to share the survey around and take part themselves.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nCaroline’s survey can be found here: https://www.caroline4gosport.co.uk/news/smartphones-schools-what-do-you-think\nThe Policy exchange Report, Disconnect, can be found here: https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/disconnect/",

As someone who regularly enjoys a swim at our local beaches, I fully understand and share people’s worries and have consistently pushed for improvements.\nThis meeting was really useful to start a dialogue between Southern Water and concerned constituents.

The Conservative Government’s Flood and Coastal Erosion Investment Plan outlines how a record £5.2 billion of investment over the next six years will be spent, including more than £860 million in 2021–22 on boosting the design and construction of more than 1,000 flooding alleviation schemes.\nMore than 850 new flood and coastal erosion defence projects have already been completed. Over 580,000 acres of agricultural land, as well as thousands of businesses, communities and major infrastructure have been protected – including more than 8,000 kilometres of roads.\nThe Government’s funding prioritised areas where flood defences were needed the most, supporting communities at high risk of flooding. New flood schemes in the most deprived parts of the country have also qualified for funding at 2.25 times the rate of other areas.\nAccording to estimates, the programme has saved the economy more than £28 billion in damages to homes and businesses through the extra protection provided to communities across the country.\nCommenting Caroline said:\n“Flooding can devastate communities, including here in Gosport, and so we must put in place protections to protect our homes and livelihoods from the impact of extreme weather.\n“That is why I welcome the £1,432,000 invested already by the Conservative Government to protect homes and businesses in Gosport with flood alleviation schemes – helping to protect homes from flooding and coastal erosion.\n“This investment is helping to guard our homes and families from the devastating impact of flooding, giving our communities the reassurance they need as we Build Back Better from the pandemic.”\nCommenting, Environment Secretary George Eustice said:\n“Our programme of work has protected over 314,000 properties, defending people, communities, and businesses from flooding and coastal erosion.

It announced in the 2020 Budget that £5.2billion will be invested in flood defences between 2021-27. This is double the previous flood and coastal defence programme and will protect 336,000 homes, as well as many farms and businesses (HMT, Budget 2020,12 March 2020, Budget 2020 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)).\n- The Conservative Government is starting work on at least 22 new shovel-ready flood defence projects in 2020 and 2021.The projects, which were identified by the Environment Agency, will drive growth and unlock a range of benefits for local economies(DEFRA, Press Release, 14 July 2022, Multi-billion pound investment as government unveils new long-term plan to tackle flooding - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)).\n- The Conservative Government established the Farming Recovery Fund to assist farmers whose land has been damaged by flooding and erosion. The Farming Recovery Fund provides money to help farmers whose agricultural land has been affected by flooding. It provides financial assistance up to 100 per cent, with a minimum grant level of £500 and a maximum grant level of £25,000 (DEFRA,Guidance,4 June 2020, [Withdrawn] Agricultural Land flooded in February 2020 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)).\n- The Conservative Government provided £200 million to help communities most at risk of flooding recover from the impact of flooding in 2020.It provided rapid assistance to 25 areas impacted by flooding to increase their resilience to flooding and coastal erosion, helping the communities to recover and avoid future damage from extreme weather (HMT, Budget 2020, 12 March 2020, Budget 2020 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk))",

She has frequently raised questions about local military issues in Parliament and has welcomed a number of Defence Ministers to visit important local military sites and businesses.\nCaroline led a successful campaign for the restoration of the entitlement to Home to Duty Travel Allowance for service personnel travelling to work on the Gosport Ferry, promoting a more sustainable journey to work, and reducing congestion on key roads on and off the peninsula.\nFollowing an increase of Service Family Accommodation complaints in 2016, Caroline raised her concerns with the then-Minister, Mark Lancaster, and was successful in getting an MP's hotline set up so that constituents' issues could be resolved efficiently.\nAfter many years of threats to the future of HMS Sultan, Caroline’s interventions helped secure the future of the site. In 2022 the MOD announced it had abandon the planned disposal of HMS Sultan altogether.\nAs a member of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme, Caroline witnessed first-hand the day-to-day work and challenges faced by our service personnel. Her visits to the Falklands and Afghanistan, along with UK military sites, have helped her to stand up for the Forces in Parliament– over the Armed Forces Covenant, war widows' pensions, R&R time and a host of other welfare issues.\nCaroline spent 4 years as Vice-Chairman (Navy) of the APPG for the Armed Forces, where she took steps to highlight the particular challenges faced by the Naval Service.\nFor almost a decade, Caroline campaigned to secure a medal for the veterans of the Arctic Convoys. While these heroic men endured dangerous and freezing conditions in WWII to keep the supply lines with Russia open, for over 70 years it remained the only major sea campaign of the war to not have received a dedicated medal. Caroline's campaign saw her lobby the Prime Minister and Defence Secretary, while also leading a debate on this issue in Parliament and contributing to Sir John Holmes' Military Medals Review. In 2012 the Government announced the creation of the Arctic Convoy Star medal - surviving veterans received their medals at the beginning of 2013 and widows and family members have since received medals on a rolling basis.\nIn 2022 Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accompanied Caroline to StandardAero, at Fleetlands, whose work on rotary wing aircraft is integral to our defence infrastructure. Caroline has since reminded Defence Procurement Minister James Cartlidge about the wealth of aviation engineering skills and experience in the Gosport area, as the Government considers bids to replace the UK’s mixed medium helicopter fleet.\nCaroline has lobbied continually for improvements to the quality of on-site accommodation for sailors at both HMS Sultan and HMS Collingwood.\nThe 2021 Census revealed that 12.5% of the Gosport population have served in the Armed Forces at some stage of their life. This is the highest proportion of anywhere in England and Wales. Caroline has worked with a number of veterans charities across her constituency and campaigned for the Veterans Agency to open a dedicated MP helpline to better assist her in supporting her constituents.\nShe is looking forward to the 80th Anniversary of the D-Day landings, which is taking place in Portsmouth.",

Over 200 people turned up to the last event in January 2023.\nCaroline has long been campaigning for the site to be sold off or brought back to use in a way that generates employment and economic activity in the area.\nAfter the meeting, she said:\n“I am grateful to the Minister for his interest in IRC Haslar and commitment to keeping local people informed. Like many residents, while I would rather it was sold and used for a different purpose, I am tired of the site rotting away at public expense.

In total over 2250 votes were cast across both rounds.\nCaroline introduced the competition to give local people a chance to show local pubs how much they are valued in the community after a punishing couple of years. The Autumn Budget lowered the threshold at which employers pay National Insurance whilst at the same time increasing the rate. This came in the wake of decreases to business rates relief, and increases to minimum wages, meaning pubs across the country are struggling with increased overheads from this month.\nCaroline visited The Windsor Castle to deliver the award, and a bottle of House of Commons fizz, to the pub’s owners, Kathy and Chris.\nRunners up were The Foresters Arms, the Old House at Home, The Jolly Roger, and The Junction Tavern.\nCaroline said:\n“I wanted this competition to spotlight our brilliant pubs and their owners, and to recognise how much they do for our local economy and how valued they are to people in Gosport.\n“We know it has been a tough few years for hospitality and tourism, with the sector at the epicentre of all the economic shocks that we’ve experienced, first with Covid, then energy costs due to the war in Ukraine, and now the Chancellor’s disastrous Budget which has made hiring prohibitively expensive and raised business rates.\n“I loved meeting Kathy and Chris, and hearing how hard they and their team have worked to build their business around a popular live music offering. It was heartwarming to meet some of their regulars and understand how much local people appreciate The Windsor Castle as a cornerstone of their community.”\nKathy Williams, speaking on behalf of the Windsor Castle management team, said:\n“Winning this award has created such a positive and exciting vibe in the pub. The staff are all so proud of it, we are all proud of what we have achieved, and it makes all the hard work 7 days a week worthwhile.\n“It's only awards like this that bring the hospitality sector to the fore.\n“We are displaying the award with pride, and all of our regular customers are so happy to have played a part in the Windsor Castle winning this accolade.\n“We wish all the other pubs in Gosport best wishes and a prosperous year.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

He also confirmed that the MHRA is moving to a new model, which will allow near automatic sign-off for medicines and technologies that have already been approved by trusted international partners in places such as the USA, Japan and Europe.\nCaroline stressed how stronger emphasis on medical innovation has the potential to improve patient outcomes, save the NHS money and boost the UK economy.\nCaroline has previously served as the Minister of State for Care from 2018-2020 and Minister of State for Digital and Culture from 2020-2021.\nSpeaking in the debate, Caroline said:\n“Medical Technology holds many of the solutions necessary to achieve things like delivering improved patient outcomes, to facilitate transformations to more sustainable models of health and care delivery. But it also has massive potential to drive economic growth.\n“Health Tech includes everything from laboratory tests, dressings, mental health apps, defibrillators, everything that is absolutely fundamental to the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions.”\n“The freedoms afforded by Brexit do allow us to seize the once in a generation opportunity to deliver a best in class regulatory system, and enable the health tech industry to support the drive for the UK to become, and continue to be a global science and technology super power.”\nThe responding Minister said:\n“The departments priority is to ensure that innovative, safe and effective devices reach patients as quickly as possible, and it’s an area of focus and an area that I want us to improve on.”\n“The Med Tech Strategy, which was published last month, is key because it recognises many of the systemic challenges faced with adopting innovative products which my Hon.

Today the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) company Standard Aero maintains the UK Chinook, Lynx and Sea King fleets at the Gosport site.\nAs part of the UK Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) New Medium Helicopter (NMH) requirement, Standard Aero has teamed with Lockheed Martin UK to bid for its Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk to replace the UK’s mixed medium helicopter fleet.\nIf the bid is successful the contract will mean upwards of 175 new, highly-skilled jobs in the Gosport area, a potential 45-year pipeline of work, and would make StandardAero in Gosport the home of the Black Hawk in the UK.\nThe Rotary Wing Enterprise and New Medium Helicopter Programmes are initiatives being driven by the British military to improve aircraft availability.\nSpeaking in the Chamber, Caroline asked the Minister for Defence Procurement:\n“Fleetlands in Gosport has been the home of military helicopter maintenance for more than 65 years. This highly skilled engineering work is really key to levelling up the area, providing much-needed jobs and opportunities.\n“Does the Minister agree that the MOD’s Rotary Wing Enterprise and New Medium Helicopter Programme would benefit greatly from these generations of expertise and skills right there in Gosport?”\nResponding to Caroline’s question, Defence Minister James Cartlidge MP said:\n“I know from my recent visit that my Right hon. Friend is a champion not only for defence in her constituency, but for defence jobs in particular. She is right about StandardAero Fleetlands, which is a valued actor in the maintenance of our rotary wing platforms.\n“The Rotary Wing Enterprise is due to enter its detailed design this year. As part of that, it will consider wider social value, including the extent to which economic prosperity is supported. But as this is a specific potential procurement, I cannot comment any further.\n“I also cannot comment on the role of particular companies in the new medium helicopter programme, but we hope to say more on that very soon.”\nCaroline has a history of standing up for the Military sites in her constituency- last November she raised the standard of accommodation at HMS Collingwood and HMS Sultan with the Minister for Defence Procurement, when she requested that he visit the two Shore Establishments’ living quarters.\nThe Minister visited HMS Sultan with Caroline in December, and agreed that progress at the sites needs to continue at pace.\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

I am therefore grateful to the Secretary of State for her apology, but that will come as cold comfort to those who are in this situation in the face of no financial compensation.\n“If I am right in what I hear, she says mitigation is too complicated and that it is someone else’s fault. That will be no comfort to those impacted. What conversations does the Secretary of State plan to have with the WASPI women to see what more support can be put in place for those most impacted?”\nIn 2022, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer signed a pledge calling for WASPI women to receive ‘fair and fast’ compensation. Just last year, Keir Starmer said that the women affected by the changes have been put in an ‘awful position’ and it’s ‘a huge injustice’. In 2019, Liz Kendall described herself as a ‘longstanding supporter of the WASPI campaign’.\nIt was imagined that voters considered the Labour party supporters of compensation for WASPI women following statements like these.\nBut on Monday, the Labour Government announced that they will not deliver on that pledge. For many, this announcement will come as a shock following the past support and promises in opposition from senior Labour figures – including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.\nIn government, the Conservatives fully cooperated with the Ombudsman and their investigation and continually increased the State Pension so that both men and women received a better deal. Thanks to Conservative increases to the State Pension increased by £3,700 between 2010 and 2024.\nCommenting, Caroline said:\n“With over 15,000 pensioners in the Gosport Constituency already reeling from losing their Winter Fuel Payment, now WASPI women are feeling the cold winds of Labour’s broken Election promises too. After multiple senior Labour figures, including the Prime Minister, committed to delivering compensation, the hypocrisy of this decision is staggering.\n“Labour attempted to sneak this announcement in, before Christmas, with no warning because they lack the courage to take responsibility for their choices, which are being paid for by pensioners in Gosport.”\nHelen Whately MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said:\n“It’s no surprise that Labour have broken the promises they made to WASPI women in opposition.\n“Yet again, they said one thing to get elected and are now doing another. Just like they had ‘no plans’ to take the Winter Fuel Payment from 10 million pensioners. They shouldn’t expect to get away with this hypocrisy.\n“Instead of trying to blame their decisions on everyone else, for once they should own the choice that they’ve made.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

Since then, she has met with Hampshire Council Education Team, relentlessly, twice a year to go through all local schools, line by line, to help drive improvement.\nEvery single one of the primary schools across Gosport, Lee on the Solent, Stubbington and Hill Head, as well as St Vincent College and The Key are now Good or Outstanding, due to hard work by both the schools and the organisations who support them. Caroline has now turned her attention to the secondary schools, and in February 2024 organised the first ever Gosport Secondary School Summit - attended by school leaders, their Multi Academy Trusts, and Department of Education and Ofsted representatives.\nSince being elected, Caroline has frequently visited the schools and colleges in her constituency, meeting with hundreds of teachers and pupils to discuss their achievements and the challenges they face. She has also welcomed many local schools and home education groups to Parliament, taking part in lively Q&A sessions with pupils of all ages. Caroline played an important role in securing new sports facilities at Bay House and Bridgemary Schools.\nCaroline has fought against Sure Start Children's Centre closures, raising her concerns in Parliament and locally. Meanwhile in 2016, as Minister for Women, Equalities and Early Years, Caroline was responsible for the implementation of 30 hours free childcare.\nKeeping children safe online is something incredibly close to Caroline's heart. She was the Digital Minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport who brought forward the Online Safety Bill which will offer much greater protections to children from the dangers of the online world. She took part in the campaign to keep children safe online as a member of the Parliamentary Inquiry into Child Safety Online and held a Cyber Safety event to help parents be confident with digital parenting. In 2019, Caroline won the star prize in a digital currency competition, winning £10,000 for local schools which she divided amongst them.\nFor those at senior school Caroline has hosted many futures-oriented events, such as welcoming Baroness Karren Brady to Bay House School and Jacqueline Gold CBE and a cohort of successful local businesswomen to Bridgemary School.\nShe has strived to encourage more girls into STEM and is a keen supporter of Gomer Junior School’s gSTEM project, bringing Ministers to see the learning in action. In 2019, the then-Secretary of State for Education, Damian Hinds, accepted her invitation to meet with local head teachers and open the Gosport STEM Centre.\nCaroline helped to secure funding for CEMAST, which trains over 1100 engineering students annually. Caroline also backed the funding bid to build CETC based at Daedalus, offering practical training so that apprentices are 'work ready' after an intensive 20 week training course. She took the then-Skills Minister, Anne Milton, to see their unique model.\nCaroline was pleased to see CEMAST become one of the first colleges in the UK to offer T-levels, launched in 2020. They offer students the chance to develop technical and vocational skills. These include an industry placement, allowing students to develop practical working experience, as well as develop a network within a given industry. Caroline was pleased to see the first generation of T-level graduates receive their results in August 2022.\nShe has promoted apprenticeship schemes throughout the area and completed her own mini-apprenticeship at Costa Coffee. She ran a campaign to shine a light on the diversity of apprenticeships in the Gosport constituency, and invited learners to Parliament to meet the then-Apprenticeships and Skills Minister, the Rt Hon Robert Halfon MP\nBelieving that educational opportunities should be available to people whatever their age, Caroline worked hard to save adult education resources when the Rowner RSR closed and was delighted to help secure the new service at the Nimrod Centre. The project was hailed as a European example of excellence and a blueprint for other adult education schemes. The project moved to St Vincent College in 2018 rebranded as \"Choices @ The Clocktower\".\nThrough her engagement with Gosport based reading programme 'We CAN Read', Caroline developed a passion for boosting basic skills among the adult population. She led a landmark debate in the House of Commons on adult literacy and numeracy and played a key role in securing a BIS Select Committee Inquiry into adult literacy and numeracy issues.

She also welcomes that monitoring of sewage discharges has gone up from 5% in 2016 to 90% today.\nSpeaking in the debate, however, she urged the government to set more ambitious targets for improving infrastructure and reducing discharges. In addition to this, Caroline spoke of the need to introduce year-round water quality testing, in contrast to current regulations requiring testing to occur between May and September only.\nSpeaking in the debate, Caroline said:\n“In Gosport, we regularly experience sewage outflows around our beaches, and that doesn’t always coincide with heavy rainfall.\n“The Environment Agency is only funded to deliver the requirements of the bathing water regulations, to test the waters, between May and September. Therefore, if discharges occur in the winter months the water quality isn’t known.\n“Our coastal ecology is impacted all year round, people use the water all year round. Can the government please tell me what thought has been given to asking the Environment Agency, and funding the Environment Agency, to check the waters all year round.”\nThe responding Minister, Trudy Harrison, said in the debate:\n“The Secretary of State made our commitment to tackling sewage discharges absolutely clear on his very first day in office. He held a call with water companies’ chief executives, and we are now working with them to explore the acceleration of infrastructure projects.\n“Water companies are investing £3.1 billion to deliver the 800 storm overflow improvements across England by 2025, but if we can go further and faster we will. The Secretary of State and myself are challenging those water companies to come up with acceleration plans to clean our water system and ensure we have the infrastructure and the supply for the future.\n“We have also recently announced that we will bring forward plans to increase the amount that the Environment Agency can directly fine water companies that pollute the environment by a thousandfold, from £250,000 up to £250 million.”\nSpeaking after the debate, Dame Caroline said:\n“I am glad that this debate was granted to highlight to the Minister the impact that sewage discharge is having on constituents.\n“I regularly have emails in my inbox from constituents who have fallen ill from exposure to dirty sea water. I am therefore pleased to see the government is taking action, with comments from the Minister regarding an acceleration plan, and fines increasing for illegal discharges over 1000 times to £250 million.\n“This is, at its core, an infrastructure problem. As such, there is no quick fix. However, more ambitious targets are needed to monitor, test the water quality and reduce the levels of sewage discharges into our waters.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nCaroline’s speech can be viewed here: https://fb.watch/g7H8tgwML1/",

In December 2021, the Government published proposed changes to the Highway Code which it said would improve safety for vulnerable road users, particularly cyclists, pedestrians, and horse riders.\nAlthough the Department for Transport stated that a working group has been created to decide how the changes should be communicated to the public, the deadline is fast approaching and there has been very little published that outlines the changes clearly and concisely for road users.\nCommenting Caroline said:\n“I have been contacted by a number of concerned constituents asking for further clarification on these changes. Considering many people are already unsure of the nuances of The Highway Code and are unlikely to read it in full, it’s important that these changes are widely publicised prior to them coming into effect. This will ensure that everyone can safely use the roads and adhere to the rules.”\nSome of the new provisions include creating a hierarchy of road users that will ensure those who can do the greatest harm (those driving large vehicles) have the greatest responsibility to reduce danger they pose to other road users. The Department for Transport has said that this system will pave the way for a ‘more mutually respectful and considerate culture of safe and effective road use’. Stronger priorities for pedestrians and cyclists at junctions and crossings are also being implemented.",

  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_mp-supports-more-clean-green-homegrown-power/content_62.html": "Local MP, Dame Caroline Dinenage, has welcomed the news of cleaner and more affordable energy to be made in Great Britain under bold plans to boost long-term energy independence, security and prosperity.\nThe Government’s British Energy Security Strategy sets out how Great Britain will accelerate the deployment of wind, new nuclear, solar and hydrogen, whilst supporting the production of domestic oil and gas in the nearer term – which could see 95% of electricity by 2030 being low carbon.\nThe strategy will see significantly more nuclear energy, with an ambition of up to 24GW by 2050 to come from this safe, clean, and reliable source of power. This would represent up to around 25% of our projected electricity demand. Subject to technology readiness from industry, Small Modular Reactors will form a key part of the nuclear project pipeline.\nA new government body, Great British Nuclear, will be set up immediately to bring forward new projects, backed by substantial funding, and we will launch the £120 million Future Nuclear Enabling Fund this month. We will work to progress a series of projects as soon as possible this decade, including Wylfa site in Anglesey. This could mean delivering up to eight reactors, equivalent to one reactor a year instead of one a decade, accelerating nuclear in Britain.\n- Offshore wind: A new ambition of up to 50GW by 2030 – more than enough to power every home in the UK – of which we would like to see up to 5GW from floating offshore wind in deeper seas. This will be underpinned by new planning reforms to cut the approval times for new offshore wind farms from 4 years to 1 year and an overall streamlining which will radically reduce the time it takes for new projects to reach construction stages while improving the environment.\n- Oil and gas: A licensing round for new North Sea oil and gas projects planned to launch in Autumn, with a new taskforce providing bespoke support to new developments – recognising the importance of these fuels to the transition and to our energy security, and that producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than imported from abroad.\n- Onshore wind: We will be consulting on developing partnerships with a limited number of supportive communities who wish to host new onshore wind infrastructure in return for guaranteed lower energy bills.\n- Heat pump manufacturing: We will run a Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition in 2022 worth up to £30 million to make British heat pumps, which reduce demand for gas.\n- We will also look to increase the UK’s current 14GW of solar capacity which could grow up to 5 times by 2035, consulting on the rules for solar projects, particularly on domestic and commercial rooftops.\nWe will aim to double our ambition to up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030, with at least half coming from green hydrogen and utilising excess offshore wind power to bring down costs. This will not only provide cleaner energy for vital British industries to move away from expensive fossil fuels, but could also be used for cleaner power, transport and potentially heat.\nCommenting Caroline said:\n“Many local people are concerned about rising energy prices and our reliance on other countries, so I welcome the Government’s commitment to increasing energy security and affordability.\nInvesting in cleaner and greener energy is of the utmost importance, it will have a big impact on consumer bills in the future.”\nThe Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said:\n“We’re setting out bold plans to scale up and accelerate affordable, clean and secure energy made in Britain, for Britain – from new nuclear to offshore wind – in the decade ahead.\nThis will reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills.”\nBusiness and Energy Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said:\n“We have seen record high gas prices around the world. We need to protect ourselves from price spikes in the future by accelerating our move towards cleaner, cheaper, home-grown energy.\nThe simple truth is that the more cheap, clean power we generate within our borders, the less exposed we will be to eye watering fossil fuel prices set by global markets we can’t control.\nScaling up cheap renewables and new nuclear, while maximising North Sea production, is the best and only way to ensure our energy independence over the coming years.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nNotes to editors\n- Prices of renewables have been consistently decreasing, with the price of offshore wind dramatically falling by around 65% since 2015, onshore wind prices down 50% since 2013, and residential roof top solar panels are now less than 50% the price they were a decade ago.\n- In the immediate term, we’re providing £9 billion package of support for consumers to manage rising cost of living. This includes a £150 council tax rebate from April and a further £200 energy bill reduction in October to cut energy bills quickly for the majority of households, while the energy price cap continues to insulate millions of customers from even higher volatile global gas prices. We are investing over £6.6 billion to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise heating over this parliament. In the next few years this will deliver upgrades to over half a million homes, delivering average bill savings of £300.\n- To further drive down demand, and permanently reduce energy bills in the longer term, a temporary VAT cut on the installation of energy efficiency projects such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps will be in place for the next five years to 2027.\n- Britain’s first nuclear power station in a generation, Hinkley Point C, is currently under construction, and we are in constructive negotiations with the developer on the Sizewell C project in Suffolk. The 2 projects combined would generate about 6.5GW of power.",

She welcomed the new concussion guidance, published by the government earlier this year which encourages everyone in sport to identify and mitigate the risks. She also urged greater research into the links with Dementia\nCaroline spoke about her committee’s work on women’s sport, encouraging inclusive and accessible sport for women with equal opportunities in school and better facilities. Pausing briefly to pay tribute to Sir Bobby Charlton, whose memorial service had taken pace earlier in the day, Dinenage went on to praise the government’s introduction of the Football Governance Bill in the King’s Speech with its commitment to set up an independent regulator, ensuring fair funding for clubs.\nFinally, she supported the government’s move to introduce the Media Bill in this session, heeding her committee’s advice to ensure that specific genres of content remain under the public service remit.\nSpeaking in the debate, Caroline said:\n“The title of today's debate is Building an NHS Fit for the Future.\n“A future-focused NHS means smarter, more efficient and more appropriate treatment as well as earlier detection, and ultimately, prevention.\n“We already lead the world in genome sequencing, and we should be harnessing its power. This means a childhood cancer mission.”\nSpeaking after the debate, Caroline said:\n“The King’s Speech has many welcome measures, such as the implementation of a smoke free generation, introduction of an independent football regulator, and a strengthened Media Bill following pre-legislative scrutiny from my committee.\n“A vital piece of the puzzle is missing, however, in the form of a Childhood Cancer Mission. To build an NHS fit for the future, we must tackle the issue of treatment, detection and care of children diagnosed with cancer.\n“I will continue to fight for this cause until we see action.”",
  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_caroline-wins-council-tax-victory/content_95.html": "Dame Caroline Dinenage, MP for Gosport, today secured a key concession in the debate on the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill on the Council Tax valuation of rooms in shared living accommodation.\nCaroline tabled an amendment, New Clause 7, to the Bill, with the aim of addressing increasingly common instances of Council Tax being placed on occupants of Homes of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs).\nThis amendment was developed alongside local businessman Daryn Brewer, who is converting numerous empty shops on Gosport High Street into high quality shared living spaces, with independent shops occupying the lower floor and high-spec HMOs on the upper floors, with shared kitchen, laundry and workspaces.\nCaroline has been campaigning on this issue alongside Portsmouth North MP, Rt Hon Penny Mordaunt MP, for two years. They have attended numerous meetings with Ministers.\nSpeaking in the debate, Caroline said:\n“There is a huge financial strain on people, often young professionals, at the very start of their careers, suddenly landed with a council tax bill of up to £1000, even once they’ve allocated the single person discount.”\n“Shared housing is a core pillar of the housing sector. In 2018, HMOs provided 3 million sharers with rental accommodation across England and Wales. So this has the potential to become a major problem.\n“Council tax is a property tax, it is not a head tax, and it should not be down to individuals who are simply paying for a bedroom to foot this bill.”\nAs a result of Caroline’s amendment, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Michael Gove, has written to confirm an accelerated consultation will now investigate how the Valuation Office Agency apply council tax bands, especially to HMOs.\nIn his letter to Caroline, he said:\n“You have very clearly set out concerns that the approach taken to the council tax banding of some properties could act as a deterrent to entering the HMO market, as well as causing financial hardship for tenants. In light of those points, I will consult on the way that HMOs are valued for council tax. This will allow us to ensure that HMOs are valued as a single dwelling, unless exceptional circumstances apply.”\nDehenna Davison, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Levelling-up responded in the debate, saying:\n“I am very grateful that we were able to reach a good position on this, and I look forward to working with her and her constituent Mr Brewer on the consultation and beyond to ensure we get this right.”\nSpeaking after the debate Caroline said:\n“I’m delighted that we are finally making progress on this issue which is increasingly causing distress and concern to residents in shared living accommodation in our area. I look forward to working alongside the Minister to ensure this is tackled once and for all.”\nAn HMO is a dwelling in which multiple residents reside with separate bedroom spaces, but a shared kitchen facility. There are increasingly instances of Council tax being charged to individual residents, rather than the landlord of the house as a whole, with each living space being falsely counted as a separate dwelling.\nCaroline tabled New Clause 7 to ensure Council Tax is charged to the property as a whole, rather than issuing several unaffordable bills to individual occupants.\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nNotes to editors:\n-To watch Caroline’s full contribution, please go to https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/9272f2d4-bab3-47fe-aa4e-c5d38298f8bb",

Since then, Caroline has continued to campaign against its closure and most recently bought the Defence Secretary the Rt Hon Ben Wallace MP to the area.\nCaroline said:\n“I’m delighted that the Ministry of Defence have finally concluded what local people have always known, that closing HMS Sultan would be a huge mistake for the MoD the Royal Navy and Gosport. This area has a proud history of serving our Armed Forces and excellent facilities such as these are vital to ensuring that our personnel are equipped with the skills they need to defend our country.”\nENDS\nFor further information contact Caroline on [email protected]\nNotes to Editors\nCaroline formed a Gosport ‘Taskforce’ made up of local and national stakeholders, including the Defence Infrastructure Organisation to plot a sound economic future for local public estate that was earmarked for disposal and discuss alternatives to closing HMS Sultan.\nAfter Caroline was first elected in 2010, she led a similar campaign to protect the Royal Naval School of Engineering at HMS Sultan from relocation to south Wales and since then it has delivered training for service personnel to a level that has been rated 'Outstanding' by OFSTED.",
  "http_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_/https_www_caroline4gosport_co_uk_news_local-housing-targets-impossible-say-conservative-mps/content_101.html": "Dame Caroline Dinenage, Member of Parliament for Gosport, has today penned a letter calling on the Government to rethink its ‘impossible’ top-down housing targets for Fareham and Gosport Borough Councils.\nAlongside Shadow Minister for Housing and Hamble Valley MP Paul Holmes, and MP for Fareham and Waterlooville Rt Hon Suella Braverman, Dame Caroline noted that the two local authorities that cover her Gosport constituency are seeing a fivefold increase in their housing targets.\nThose Councils are currently adding an average of 211 houses every year, but are required by Labour’s updated National Planning Policy Framework to jointly add 1242 houses annually. According to Annex 1 in the revised Framework the target will come into effect on 12 March 2025.\nThe letter compares the fivefold increase in housing targets in the Gosport and Fareham jurisdictions with Labour-controlled Southampton City Council’s housing targets, who have seen a 12% reduction as a result of Angela Rayner’s consultation.\nGosport in particular is extremely overdeveloped, with only the Strategic Gap, that Caroline has campaigned to maintain, standing in the way of total development. According to Gosport Borough Council’s draft Local Plan, the Borough is ‘over 80% built on’. The Strategic Gap currently serves to keep communities separate, maintain green space, and alleviate air pollution.\nHowever, under the proposals of the revised National Planning Policy Framework, if Councils are unable to verify a five-year supply of houses, decision makers are expected to approve development. An article from October stated that Gosport has “no idea where to build ‘extra’ new homes for government housebuilding targets”, prompting fears that the likely failure to hit inflated housing targets will result in a housebuilding free-for-all.\nDame Caroline Dinenage said:\n‘I am incredibly concerned about what the Government’s new housing targets mean for people in Gosport, Lee on the Solent, Stubbington, and Hill Head.\n‘There is very little land supply locally that these new houses can be built on. Utilising our brownfield sites may go some way to satisfying these monstrously high targets, but there is a long way to go to get these fit for development. In the meantime, I do not want to see our vital Strategic Gap bulldozed and tarmacked as an offering to this Labour Government – whilst Labour authorities get off scot-free.\n‘Our services are stretched, our roads are busy and polluted, and our towns lack green space. This number of new homes would be a catastrophe for local communities.’\nPaul Holmes, Shadow Minister for Housing and Member of Parliament for Hamble Valley, said:\n‘At the heart of these reforms is a deeply concerning trend: the sidelining of local authorities and communities. The Government promised in their manifesto that local authorities would have a central role in planning decisions. Yet, we are now seeing a shift away from this commitment.’\nRt Hon Suella Braverman, Member of Parliament for Fareham and Waterlooville, said:\n‘Fareham Borough Council has rightly committed to delivering more than their fair share of houses through the Welborne housing development. Once completed, the Welborne project will have provided 6,000 homes for families in Hampshire—but this Labour government couldn’t care less. Local authorities are at the behest of Labour’s myopic plans to destroy our communities and concrete over the countryside through imposing unrealistic, rushed housing targets.\n‘On behalf of my constituents, I strongly oppose Labour’s arbitrary top-down housing targets for Fareham Borough Council.’\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]",

The ethanol content of the petrol – 10%, up 5% from current petrol - will have the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 750 000 tonnes annually.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said:\n“The next 15 years will be absolutely crucial for slashing emissions from our roads, as we all start to feel the benefits of the transition to a zero-emission future.\n“But before electric cars become the norm, we want to take advantage of reduced CO2 emissions today. This small switch to petrol containing bioethanol at 10% will help drivers across country reduce the environmental impact of every journey. Overall this could equate to about 350,000 cars being taken off our roads entirely.”\nGrant Pearson, Commercial Director of Ensus UK on Teesside, said:\n“We welcome today’s announcement as the availability of E10 will instantly make petrol a lot cleaner, providing significant carbon reduction benefits to our environment on the long road to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n“It is vitally important to protecting and potentially growing jobs in this industry, including many in the supply chain, and will bring tangible benefits to UK farmers and environmentally-conscious motorists.”\nThis is one of the latest measures announced to ensuring the Government reaches it net-zero emission target by 2050. Recently, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, announced the phasing out of coal and wet wood sales in England and carbon cuts to heavy industry and homes through a £90 million-pound package.\nLocal MP, Caroline Dinenage, commented:\n“Pleased to see the latest measures being taken to reduce our carbon emissions and combat climate change.

Caroline also hosted a Cyber Safety Event to help parents keep their children safe online.\nCaroline successfully lobbied the Secretary of State for Justice to review the existing limit for causing death by dangerous driving following the deaths of two Gosport teenagers. In October 2017 the government announced plans to introduce tougher sentences for those whose irresponsible driving devastates lives.\nFollowing the distressing case of Baby Stanley, Caroline raised concerns about the maximum sentence for causing or allowing the death of a child; which she believes is far too low.\nAs a Champion of the Hestia ‘UK Says No More’ Campaign, Caroline welcomed the passing of the Domestic Abuse Bill in 2021 as this will strengthen support for victims and their families, while legally broadening the definition of domestic abuse and ensuring that perpetrators of crimes such as ‘revenge porn’ and ‘non-fatal strangulation’ are properly punished. For the first time, the statutory definition of domestic abuse will also include emotional, coercive or control and economic abuse, as well as physical. She believes that this is a vital step towards supporting survivors and tackling perpetrators.\nA strong supporter of the Upskirting Bill, Caroline was delighted that this has now come into force and perpetrators can face up to two years in prison for this degrading and disgusting criminal offence.\nCaroline welcomed the 220 new police recruits in the Hampshire Constabulary announced in 2021 - covering the Gosport and Fareham forces.

They are all run by trustees, most of whom are volunteers, and who take responsibility for the charity’s crucial work. Without their hard work and dedication, charities would not be able to provide vital support to local communities.\nThe week is running from 7th to 11th November and provides an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of the 700,000 trustees across England and Wales. The theme of this year is ‘making a difference in changing times’ – recognising that their positive impact is now as important as ever. The week offers the opportunity for trustees to share their experiences and develop their skills through a wide range of events, training and guidance.\nThe campaign also encourages more people to consider trusteeship. The Charity Commission says that younger people, women and people from diverse ethnic backgrounds are underrepresented on charity boards and that charities may therefore be losing out on their skills, talents, experiences and perspectives.\nDame Caroline Dinenage MP said:\n“I have been privileged to visit many outstanding charities across our area who work across a whole range of different issues. From Gosport Voluntary Action to Oarsome Chance and GAFIRS to Citizens Advice. They all rely on the dedication of volunteer trustees. I want to thank all those who give up their time, it is a fantastic way to support our community.”\nHelen Stephenson, Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, said:\n“Trustees play a vital role in every community and across society. I’d like to extend the Charity Commission’s thanks to the trustees of Gosport and encourage others in the area to consider taking up the role. Trusteeship is hugely valuable service, and it also brings great rewards for the individual, not least in terms of personal fulfilment and the leadership experience that trusteeship offers. During these challenging times we need more people from all walks of life to come forward and serve as trustees.”\nENDS\nFor more information contact [email protected]\nTo find out more about Charity Trustees Week 2022, please go to: https://trusteesweek.org/",

And I know you will appreciate that during the consultation phase it would be inappropriate for the County Council to enter into a debate about the proposal. However, I would like to take the opportunity to answer the direct questions you have asked and correct some misinformation which appears to be circulating.\n\"Financial position\n\"In your letter of 14 January you state:\n\"“…they are a self funded service which consistently and substantially over-recovers financially, bolstering the County’s finances with their surplus feeding back into the coffers.”\n\"The proposal to repurpose the Stubbington Study Centre site to provide a new specialist secure welfare children’s home is based on its suitability according to the site selection criteria, rather than its financial performance.\n\"Alternative sites\n\"In your letter of 21 January you list three alternative sites. I can confirm that none met the selection criteria and therefore were not shortlisted for further consideration.\n\"Covenant\n\"Our title review confirms that the site was purchased by Southampton City Council and then transferred to Hampshire County Council in a local government reorganisation. It was not acquired by way of a gift, and there are no covenants on the title that limit the use to educational use or the protection of animals.\n\"Consultation\n\"I note your comments regarding the consultation not lending itself to members of the public responding. I would like to make clear that the consultation is open to all. It is designed to enable an informed decision about the impacts of closing the centre and as such includes a number of questions on the reasons people use the centre and impacts of potential closure. However, it also includes a general comments question and an email address has also been made available for any member of the public to submit their views.

In 2019 this was expanded to Portsmouth Harbour Marine Scene to encompass the wider area.\nCaroline welcomed Sir Ben Ainslie's £90m Americas Cup Race Team HQ to the area and sees the plans for a multi-million pound investment into Haslar Marina as key to creating a centre of excellence in our region.\nCaroline has met with successive Transport Ministers to make the case for necessary improvements to legislation governing the use of Personal Water Craft (PWC), such as jet skis and RIBs. Existing legislation fails to protect the users of PWCs and other water users, as was clearly demonstrated by the death of Gosport’s Ryan McKinlay.\nCaroline believes, that is vital that our marine habitats are protected and she is delighted that there will be 41 new Marine Conservation Zones across the UK, safeguarding almost 12,000 square kilometres of marine habitats. Our local seas also fall under Marine Protection Areas.\nAs an MP for a coastal constituency Caroline sees for herself on a daily basis the devastating impact of plastics in our oceans and on our beaches that is why she has taken part in two #GiveUpPlasticForLent pledges and supported the ‘Plastic-Free Parliament’ campaign.\nShe is a keen supporter of local groups who carry out beach cleans, such as Surfers Against Sewage and can regularly be seen supporting the events. Caroline has also organised a beach clean with the Marine Conservation Society.\nCaroline also supported the world’s most comprehensive ban on microbeads to tackle the large number of plastics choking our marine life.\nThe Gosport Sea Wall is the vital barrier which helps protect the integrity of Portsmouth Harbour. Portsmouth Naval Base, the Commercial Port and hundreds of homes and businesses which surround the harbour depend upon it being kept in good condition. In January 2022 Caroline arranged a multi agency meeting to ensure there is a strong plan in place to see the wall is properly maintained.",
