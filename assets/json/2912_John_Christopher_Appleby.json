Their MPs were whipped only a few days ago to vote against a windfall tax, which Labour are now crowing about, but which in fact was called for by the Lib Dems some months earlier!\nMay 19th: The Met Police were reluctant to investigate lockdown parties at no. 10, presumably thinking they’d be accused of political interference whatever their findings. They were eventually persuaded to look into twelve events, and investigated eight of them, finally issuing Fixed Penalty Notices to 126 people. But Boris Johnson received just one £50 fine, despite at least ‘dropping in’ to several parties, apparently on the flimsy basis that no. 10 is his home and so he was working in most cases. However, junior civil servants who cooperated initially with the Sue Gray internal report have been issued with many of the fines, possibly partially as a result of their confessions. They are reportedly furious!\nDurham police are, meanwhile, investigatingone event that Keir Starmer was at. If they find Starmer guilty of an offence (for which he’s promised to resign), that would seem grossly unfair, as there was clearly no culture of negligence in his case, at most a marginal misinterpretation of the rules. I trust that their investigation is to demonstrate political neutrality, knowing that the Government was under investigation.\nMaybe the Sue Gray report will strengthen the case that the Government, and Johnson in particular, were careless, negligent, dismissive, arrogant. I do hope that the public will continue to grow in their distrust of this selfish, arrogant and dishonest man, so that either he’s forced out of office or that he leads his party to a truly dreadful result in the General Election that must come by 2024.\nMay 9th: A huge shock for the Government, losing 487 council seats, consistently down in the polls, and with Labour more trusted than them on almost every criterion. But bigger still, they are threatened in their heartlands, particularly the South and South-West, by the Liberal Democrat surge, gaining 222 seats and 3 councils (returning to the same number of controlled councils as c. 2010). After Chesham & Amersham and North Shropshire, there are two tasty by-elections coming up too. The Government is finally looking very vulnerable.\nMay 4th: Many Conservative councillors are distancing themselves from their own party in government, with slogans such as ‘Local Conservatives’ and, even further, ‘Don’t punish local Conservatives for the mistakes made in Westminster’. The North Tyneside group have published pseudo-Green leaflets aiming to get some Labour voters to switch and save a few marginal Tory councillors. A tiny imprint has ‘NTCF’ (Conservative Federation), but for most people they look like Green Party leaflets, which they’re not! After all, it was local Conservative members who voted in Johnson as leader and hence Prime Minister, when his character and history were well-known.\nThis distancing is not new. During the Coalition years (whatever you think of that period), many local Lib Dem councillors lost their seats owing to general unhappiness with the national policies and compromises, and some campaigned with the designation ‘Focus Team’ and no mention of ‘Liberal Democrat’. I doubt this is effective and might even be counter-productive.\nBy Friday morning, we’ll see if there is indeed a substantial national swing in seat numbers, but it will be measured against 2018, when Theresa May’s government was already unpopular. Locally, the Lib Dems have a strong challenge in Weetslade ward, and the Greens in Whitley Bay. We share some aims (environment, and the need for scrutiny and challenge to this Labour ‘one-party state’), but remain distinct parties, especially at national level, where the Greens try to defend their ‘leave NATO’ policy – not at all sensible at this time!\nApril 19th: Desperate to displace headlines about lawbreaking at Number 10, and to shore up their ’base’, this dreadful Government have proposed an appalling plan for refugees – condemned by almost everyone who’s thought about the issue at all. The Civil Service are constrained, but have said it’s unclear whether it will be effective and hence value for money. It’s dishonest in that the UK takes a relatively small number of refugees, most of those crossing the Channel are genuine, and alternative safe and legal routes have been closed. It’s ineffective, as a deterrent works only if it’s known. It’s illegal, as it fails to deal properly with refugees. And it’s unethical and cruel. Perhaps most bizarre of all, Rees-Mogg asserts that it’s ’redemptive’. My view is much as Pope Francis’.\nApril 11th: Rishi Sunak impressed the public with his charm, confidence and ‘generosity’ with public spending. Many (including him!) thought he might be the next Prime Minister, but I always wondered – we knew nothing of any vision for the UK, ability in managing the executive decision-making or skill in building and managing a team. We did know that he’d been a hedge-fund manager, good at making money from insubstantial investments and manipulation of markets. In the past few weeks, his fall from grace has been spectacular – a budget that failed to address the cost-of-living crisis, apparent opposition to sensible energy/climate plans, and then his wife’s non-dom status for her fantastic wealth. Then, on top of all that. questions about his US and UK status.\nOn Thursday I was visiting Richmond in North Yorkshire, his constituency, and was by chance interviewed by an ITV team seeking the views of local residents. They featured my views at some length: https://twitter.com/ITVNewsPolitics/status/1512098733554610187 Some of the comments following the clip are hilarious! I was quite honest with them about who I was but they evidently thought the clip worth keeping. The whole tweet was re-tweeted by Wes Streeting (Shadow Cabinet), so it had lots of views!\nApril 6th: Today the National Insurance increase is implemented. On top of huge rises in energy costs, and a continuing squeeze on benefits and local authority budgets, times will be hard for many families. Yes, it’s possible to manage on less, and people used to know more about how to do that, but life wasn’t very good for many in those ‘nostalgic times’, and in any case, why should ordinary families be told to put up with things by people who don’t have to? When coupled with a casual and hypocritical attitude to the pandemic rules by Downing street, it’s clear that this Government is seriously out of touch. Many people remain to be convinced that Labour is ready for government, but increasingly they (and the Liberal Democrats) are seen as a serious party who cares.\nThe Government is also out of touch on other issues. Most people oppose the selling off of Channel 4 – pointless except as a piece of dogma. Most people are supportive of more on-shore wind turbines and against fracking, yet the Government is against one and favours the other. People support more Ukrainian refugees, but the Home Office makes that very difficult. They appear to be completely wrapped up in their own rhetoric. It’s to be hoped that they lose power sooner rather than later!\nThe immediate prospect of a challenge to the Government will come on May 5th in the local elections. Although primarily about local issues, and distorted to some extent by dissatisfaction that results from national funding but which impinges on other parties, it seems likely that many usual Conservative voters will stay at home, whilst opposition voters will turn out with greater enthusiasm. In North Tyneside, there are prospects of more opposition councillors from the Lib Dems and the Greens, who both had impressive gains in target wards. Although the overall political ‘colour’ of the two is very different, we share the aims of addressing the climate change, holding the local council to account, and scrutinising plans and decisions to set better priorities and ensure value for money.\nMarch 14th: I’ve just watched short videos of arrests in Russian cities – one of a protestor with a card saying, literally, ‘two words’, and the other with a card that was completely blank. The Russian government is afraid of criticism. Much of its attitude is even more rooted in the past than Britain’s current nostalgia of ‘Dad’s Army’ and ‘Britannia rules the waves’.\nBut it’s also true that our governments have failed to tell the truth, in the sense of both words and actions. The belief that economic engagement would convert Russia, China and other autocracies to our liberal democracy was naive. Of course engagement, and particularly educating foreign students, is part of what’s needed, but sterner stuff must also be shown when such trust is clearly abused, as in Salisbury, Crimea, Syria, and substantial dependence on Russian energy supplies was a real risk, especially coupled with inadequate storage.\nAt the same time, our governments have failed to be honest with us about the need to pay our way – in taxes sufficient to provide the services we value, and in balancing our trade so that foreign investment can be selective rather than uncritical. The ‘golden visa’ scheme was always a terrible idea (actually introduced under Gordon Brown!), but should at least have had safeguards, notably a restriction on political donations for an initial period.\nIt’s commonplace to say ‘they’re all liars’ about our politicians, whilst expecting unrealistic things to be done, and voting for the best promises rather than the honest but more mundane ‘we’ll do what we can’. Vision is great, exaggerated promises are not.\nFebruary 8th: I decided some years ago that I hate dogma. That’s not a particular dogma, just all of it! There might be a very few exceptions, but these would be a few ‘truths’ for me, such as statements about the importance of truth itself, honesty, the value of human beings, the need to look after the world for the sake of our children and grandchildren, etc.\nDogma means (to me) an explicit statement of a belief that the holder is unwilling to question. I have no objection to strong beliefs, strongly argued, it’s the closed-mindedness that’s the problem, the ‘black-and-white’ view of the subject or the world. Just now, it’s party politics that’s at the forefront of my mind, but I will mention one other area.\nBoris Johnson shouldn’t be Prime Minister. Increasingly, that’s a view held by many Conservative voters and MPs, as well as almost all others. It’s commonly said that by continuing to support him in post, those people are ‘putting party before country’, or ‘putting their own careers before principles’. I don’t think it’s so simple, though I’m not excusing it. It’s clear to me that for many of these MPs (and voters), there is a strong conviction that a Conservative government is best for the country, certainly in the longer-term and probably in the medium-term too. That is, even with doubts and problems at present, they continue to think that a Labour government will be worse for the country overall than almost any conceivable government by ‘their’ party. In this sense, they might believe they are putting country before anything else. Of course, an element of personal career is relevant, but the argument extends easily to: ‘I’ll be a better MP for my constituency than my opponent, because of my core values.’\nWhilst I understand this mentality up to a point, it’s dangerous, as it can lead incrementally to acceptance, even advocacy, of bad policy, bad behaviour, bad management, etc. Surely most Conservative MPs would not have supported Johnson so willingly in 2019 if they’d known in advance how he might behave, how little he valued them, their opinions, their values.\nA dogmatic position that says, in effect: any Conservative government, however bad, is always better than any Labour government, however good, is not a rational position, it’s a black-and-white dogma and should be called out and given no power. Of course, the same would be true for the converse.\nHere’s my other example: When I was young, homosexuality was unknown, then weird, then a joke, then strange, then gradually more a fact of life. However, until I was about 25-30, I wasn’t wholly comfortable with this, whilst trying hard to be accepting. What finally brought me ‘off the fence’ was this: To hold the traditional view (of heterosexual lifelong marriage) was, in effect, to judge that any traditional marriage relationship, however bad, was automatically better than any other form of relationship, however good. That is, a dogmatic traditional position was clearly wrong and untenable for me. Thereafter, I accepted the validity and value of all good, committed, respectful relationships, hetero- or homo-sexual, whilst still rejecting any relationship that didn’t meet those values, or didn’t try hard to. I could add other rejected dogmas to these two, but that’s enough for today!\nJanuary 23rd: Boris Johnson is on the ropes, by all accounts and appearances. Parties (in no.10, in the garden, in his flat), threats to MPs, Islamophobia, on top of general dishonesty and incompetence, factional strife in his Party, and a growing cost-of-living crisis contribute to, at last, public opinion that he should resign or be sacked, with someone competent and honest in his place. Will it happen? Yes! Will it happen this week? Unclear.\nWho would replace him? Sunak is front-runner, but we have no idea of his vision or competence, just his manner, and he has apparently little sympathy for the poor or the environment. If he takes over, then I hope the many problems are not shrugged off by him as ‘not his fault’, as any incoming PM must be seen to do something to alleviate them. I hope too that he doesn’t take over soon enough to get the benefit of the doubt in the May elections, but late enough for his competence to be as yet unclear.\nPM is a job I’ll never have and couldn’t do, as my skin isn’t thick enough even if I had the ability! However, I sometimes think of what my first priorities might be in that position. Top of the list would be to reduce hostility and polarisation in Parliament, in the UK, with our European neighbours and beyond, for without that little effective governance is possible. I’d stop the hostility to asylum-seekers, but maybe process some in France if possible, with a clearer legal route otherwise to minimise the ‘boats’ problem.\nI’d maintain masks in most indoor places to slow the pandemic, and slow the NHS vaccination deadline just a little to get more acceptance. I’d have a windfall tax on energy companies to offset the recent price rises and/or other costs on the poor.\nFor NI, I’d agree an SPS deal to ease the customs and border issues, and with the EU fix collaborations on Euratom, Horizon, and the musicians visa scheme. I’d revisit the Australia trade deal if possible to reinstate welfare and environmental standards.\nThere’s lots more! Much of the above doesn’t bring massive costs, but increases cooperation and trust, and partially tackles several crises. Good governance is more about the mundane than the dramatic, but honesty, trust and steady, small steps are usually the best way forward.",

But there are other Conservatives with more experience who’d stand more chance of tackling the crises of the pandemic, the economy, cost-of-living, etc.",

Brexit barriers are causing problems with Northern Ireland and with exports, and would stifle imports too if rules are imposed as planned. Stimuli to private enterprise are the Conservative counter to cuts in state funding, but there are more burdens on the former and insufficient of the latter, so foodbank use grows and we have an NHS in crisis – doctors and nurses stressed out and many leaving.\nBut the biggest of all is climate change, where Britain’s lead role looks tenuous at best. The Government’s plans are better than before, and better than many countries, but still far short, especially when Johnson’s sceptical Chancellor declines to address any real action, and too many interviewers talk only of the costs of net-zero rather than both investment and the cost of inaction. Similarly, cuts in aid, apart from the moral aspect (and repayment for our past exploitation), are likely to increase conflict, migration and prolongation of the pandemic.\nScepticism of government, and perhaps of much traditional authority, is part of what led to Brexit and this dreadful PM and Cabinet, but almost everything Johnson does makes things worse. It is to be hoped that some recent mildly rebellious speeches and acts by his own MPs and ex ministers are a sign that good sense might yet return to the Conservative Party, and allow Britain to rebuild its reputation and actually take a leading role on climate.",

Genuine Government achievements in the medium to long term will be most effective, but the ‘optics’ matter too. Whilst it’s perfectly true that leading Conservatives were much worse, shameless and dishonest about gifts, lobbying and preferential treatment, it’s surprising that Starmer didn’t realise that being seen to set a good example would help his cause. Yes, he follows the rules, but Johnson’s and Trump’s successes show that this in itself doesn’t win many friends.\nThe Israeli government and IDF are doing terrible things, only some of which even fall under the heading of self-defence. If citizens of the West Bank were being properly treated, instead of the security forces tacitly (or even actively) colluding with aggression by ‘settlers’, it would be easier to believe that Israel was only defending itself. And UN resolutions over the years were evidently not enough – some sanctions should have enforced withdrawal from the occupied territories, and punished those who attacked ordinary Palestinians there. Moreover, Netanyahu openly favoured Hamas to avoid Palestinian unity, and members of his cabinet make clear that they despise all those people and wish to remove them all. In addition, Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, but the Obama administration should have offered more reward to Tehran for that, which might have helped the credibility of the then moderate President. I dread what might happen next.\nWe’re also seeing yet more film of floods and climate disruption, yet too many people still don’t take seriously the need for change. It’s not just governments, who need to see that people will agree to change and will vote for it, nor technology, which is only part of the solution. We need to reduce, reuse, repair, recycle, and to show self-restraint in use of water, energy and other resources. The world can’t afford a car for every person, even an electric one!",

Local Lib Dem councillors suffered badly in the period c.2013-2017 or so. And this time, not only were Conservatives not credible, but Labour managed to skip their ‘honeymoon period’ in government too, creating an impression of an uncaring regime in their determination to be seen as financially prudent.\nIt was a good day for the Lib Dems, with over 300 councillors gained, and control of three councils – Cambridge, Oxford and Shropshire.\nWhat about Reform? They are cock-a-hoop with over 600 councillors and 10 councils. But any talk of future government is highly questionable. They appear to have no real policies, a leader who hates sharing power (members get no say on policy), and minimal experience in local government. One successful candidate talked of ‘waste’ but could only think of biscuits in council meetings. It’s highly probable that within a year they’ll find they can’t do very much, especially when funding is so tight, and that waste is not only less than they think but is very hard to reduce.\nThe local Elected Mayor contest in North Tyneside led to a Labour Mayor again, but by a small margin of 444 votes.

In 24 hours they have:\n- been strongly criticised for blocking publication of a report into Russian interference in our elections\n- been stopped from using the Civil Service to attack the Opposition\n- been told their Universal Credit adverts are misleading\n- had to apologise for insensitive remarks about Grenfell\n- the Welsh Secretary has resigned over his support for a former aide\n- produced a doctored video of Sir Keir Starmer\n- compared Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin\n- gone back on a promise to give MPs a vote on extending the Transition period.\nAll that in one day!!",
  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_mayoral_policy-summary/content_37.html": "This page gives a brief outline of my views and what I hoped to do if possible as North of Tyne Mayor if elected in 2019 (always remembering the part that’s south of the Tyne – so I call this ‘North of Tyne Plus‘.\nBelow you’ll find information about: Promoting the Area, Working Together, Better Devolution, Europe, Environment, Air Quality, Education, Jobs & Economy, Rural Affairs, Housing, Transport, Health & Wellbeing.\nPromoting the area: The Mayor will be a voice for the whole North of Tyne area – a voice within the area (ensuring people get heard by politicians and decision-makers) and beyond (with other areas, Government and internationally). We need to feel pride in our wonderful and energetic people and heritage. Too often southerners think we’re remote, we should travel to them. We even get forgotten in the weather forecast some days!\nWorking together: The powers of the new Mayor and Combined Authority are limited, but we can achieve much together – building trust is important. Firstly, the three Local Authorities need to coordinate what they do – the whole can be greater than the sum of the parts. Secondly, we need to work together to use the new budget and powers we have. Thirdly, we need to be much better at involving the people of the area, the employers, and public and voluntary sectors in a shared vision and purpose.\nBetter Devolution: The new Mayor and Combined Authority will be weaker than any other similar scheme – London, Manchester, Teesside. That’s because Gateshead, Durham, South Tyneside and Sunderland didn’t agree to join the proposals at this stage. It’s important to encourage them to do so, so we can have full powers over Transport and others areas, and much greater ability both to work across the North-East and to lobby Westminster. I’d aim to re-establish a North-East Constitutional Convention to explore this.\nEurope: Brexit in any form will be bad for the UK, damaging our economy and reducing our influence on the World stage. By ourselves, we’ll be less able to negotiate good trade deals, we’ll not be listened to in political matters, and environmental progress will be harder. Our reputation and influence have already been badly damaged. Europe needs some reforms, but much that’s blamed on the EU is a result either of global change or our own government’s failure to use the rules well. For example, we’re the only country that’s allowed half our fishing quota to be sold to foreign companies. Although another referendum would be divisive, so will any alternatives, including the bad feelings and social damage from a reduced economy.\nEnvironment: We are now in a Climate Emergency. I salute and welcome the attention now being given to this vital issue as a result of the school strikes and the Extinction Rebellion, though I do not endorse all the actions taken. Technology is part of the answer, but bold political action is needed, and also individual acceptance of the unacceptable cost of some luxuries, like taking cheap holidays abroad. Dualling the A1 is recommended by almost everyone, but more roads means more traffic – I’d approve only limited work on particular bottlenecks. Even more urgent, probably, is the dramatic fall in insect numbers owing to over-use of chemicals and climate too. This could threaten the world’s food supply and create famines in the not-too-distant future. The EU has fortunately banned nicotinoid insecticides and are considering other chemicals.\nOther Environmental actions needed are to reduce the use of private vehicles, and clean up any we do use – electric cars, car-clubs (can be run in small villages!). We also need green energy – I’d support more on-shore wind power if the local community sees some benefit from it. New homes should all have good insulation and solar panels: can planning conditions be amended to require this?\nAir Quality: Poor air is killing people. Some places, like Nottingham, have taken action sooner and avoided unpopular ‘quick fixes’ that merely stop people driving. We need to identify the long-term solution, then agree how to get there. For cities (but also towns like Alnwick) reduced car traffic is needed, but achieved by making the city attractive and modifying bus lanes, parking and increasing cycle lanes, not merely adding costs and restrictions. I’d set up a Mayoral Commission on Air Quality to explore this further.\nEducation: Educational provision is patchy, especially away from the city. The Adult Education budget needs focussing on basic skills (reading, numeracy, and IT) as employers have identified this need, and IT skills are needed also for job and benefit applications. The Mayor will help finalise and promote the School Improvement Challenge being put to Government, and which will include mental health support.\nJobs and Economy: The NE Local Enterprise Partnership, working with the new Combined Authority, has responsibility for promoting ‘inclusive employment’ and development of the economy. A key aim, in my view, is to support and promote small businesses, urban and rural, which often lack the knowledge, expertise and time to access funding and public sector procurement. An apprenticeship can be valuable to a small business, who must pay only 10% of the cost, but they might not know this. Public sector work is usually snapped up by big companies as the procedures and paperwork are too onerous. There should be support units for small businesses across North of Tyne to ensure these worthwhile firms flourish. We must also encourage lasting jobs that pay the Living Wage too.\nRural affairs: Northumberland is a very sparsely populated county, but we boast of its loveliness and want it to continue. That means supporting agriculture and rural industry, and helping to develop sustainable rural communities. Citizens Assemblies are often cited as a means of engaging people and gauging views – we need these in rural areas and not just the city. Local office/workshop space with affordable homes, and with excellent IT connectivity, are needed and might reduce transport needs. Most of all, though, we need to remember and involve these areas – ‘North of Tyne’ starts badly by missing out a large chunk of Northumberland! Some small villages have only one public building – a church or pub – so I’d support using these wherever possible for othe activities. Could IT access be supported in pubs as well as churches for those unable to access benefits, services and applying for jobs?\nHousing: Every government promises more housing, but it’s expensive and often controversial to site. There is ample evidence that many brownfield sites are highly suitable for development, so a Register of Brownfield Sites is needed, with greenfield development very limited. Revised planning rules are needed to ensure that social benefits and environmental factors play a greater part in planning decisions. Borrowing powers for local authorities have recently been relaxed and should be used to focus on affordable and specialist housing.\nTransport: The poor devolution settlement we’ve been offered will be much better if we can bring Gateshead, Sunderland etc. into a wider scheme. That would then include full transport powers, more integration with police and other services, and potentially health powers too (like Manchester). With or without that, we need to promote public transport, cleaner buses, cycling and walking routes, and lobby for major improvements including the East Coast main line bottlenecks near Gateshead (re-open the Leeming line), further Metro work (dualling the track near Jarrow), and selective improvement to the A1 (but more roads can mean more cars!). Rural transport needs a mix of buses, ‘dial-a-ride’ services, car-clubs (can be based in villages), but the long-term approach must be to identify and support rural sustainability overall – quite complex!\nHealth and Wellbeing: The Mayor will have no direct health powers, but health and well-being involve many factors. The prospect of a good and secure job on the Living Wage, exercise encouraged through cycling and walking, better air quality, and improved education leading to satisfaction can all be addressed. The draft School Improvement Challenge also mentions mental health, and support for this in schools should also be championed by the Mayor. Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to the health of society: we might not be able to do much locally but should add our voice whenever we can.",

Rumblings from discontented backbenchers and former ministers, but nervousness that an attempt to unseat him will fail and make things worse. He should never have been shortlisted for the membership to vote on a leader, just as Corbyn shouldn’t have been for Labour, giving the electorate an invidious choice in 2019. It’s nonsense to think there’s no suitable replacement, though some talented and (more) principled MPs might be reluctant to spend two years mopping up only to lose a General Election and share some of the blame.\nAnd a huge £15bn support package, whilst essential, looks like both an attempted distraction and a complete contradiction of what’s been said and believed by this Government. Their MPs were whipped only a few days ago to vote against a windfall tax, which Labour are now crowing about, but which in fact was called for by the Lib Dems some months earlier!\nMay 19th: The Met Police were reluctant to investigate lockdown parties at no. 10, presumably thinking they’d be accused of political interference whatever their findings. They were eventually persuaded to look into twelve events, and investigated eight of them, finally issuing Fixed Penalty Notices to 126 people. But Boris Johnson received just one £50 fine, despite at least ‘dropping in’ to several parties, apparently on the flimsy basis that no. 10 is his home and so he was working in most cases. However, junior civil servants who cooperated initially with the Sue Gray internal report have been issued with many of the fines, possibly partially as a result of their confessions. They are reportedly furious!\nDurham police are, meanwhile, investigatingone event that Keir Starmer was at. If they find Starmer guilty of an offence (for which he’s promised to resign), that would seem grossly unfair, as there was clearly no culture of negligence in his case, at most a marginal misinterpretation of the rules. I trust that their investigation is to demonstrate political neutrality, knowing that the Government was under investigation.\nMaybe the Sue Gray report will strengthen the case that the Government, and Johnson in particular, were careless, negligent, dismissive, arrogant. I do hope that the public will continue to grow in their distrust of this selfish, arrogant and dishonest man, so that either he’s forced out of office or that he leads his party to a truly dreadful result in the General Election that must come by 2024.\nMay 9th: A huge shock for the Government, losing 487 council seats, consistently down in the polls, and with Labour more trusted than them on almost every criterion. But bigger still, they are threatened in their heartlands, particularly the South and South-West, by the Liberal Democrat surge, gaining 222 seats and 3 councils (returning to the same number of controlled councils as c. 2010). After Chesham & Amersham and North Shropshire, there are two tasty by-elections coming up too. The Government is finally looking very vulnerable.\nMay 4th: Many Conservative councillors are distancing themselves from their own party in government, with slogans such as ‘Local Conservatives’ and, even further, ‘Don’t punish local Conservatives for the mistakes made in Westminster’. The North Tyneside group have published pseudo-Green leaflets aiming to get some Labour voters to switch and save a few marginal Tory councillors. A tiny imprint has ‘NTCF’ (Conservative Federation), but for most people they look like Green Party leaflets, which they’re not! After all, it was local Conservative members who voted in Johnson as leader and hence Prime Minister, when his character and history were well-known.\nThis distancing is not new. During the Coalition years (whatever you think of that period), many local Lib Dem councillors lost their seats owing to general unhappiness with the national policies and compromises, and some campaigned with the designation ‘Focus Team’ and no mention of ‘Liberal Democrat’. I doubt this is effective and might even be counter-productive.\nBy Friday morning, we’ll see if there is indeed a substantial national swing in seat numbers, but it will be measured against 2018, when Theresa May’s government was already unpopular. Locally, the Lib Dems have a strong challenge in Weetslade ward, and the Greens in Whitley Bay. We share some aims (environment, and the need for scrutiny and challenge to this Labour ‘one-party state’), but remain distinct parties, especially at national level, where the Greens try to defend their ‘leave NATO’ policy – not at all sensible at this time!\nApril 19th: Desperate to displace headlines about lawbreaking at Number 10, and to shore up their ’base’, this dreadful Government have proposed an appalling plan for refugees – condemned by almost everyone who’s thought about the issue at all. The Civil Service are constrained, but have said it’s unclear whether it will be effective and hence value for money. It’s dishonest in that the UK takes a relatively small number of refugees, most of those crossing the Channel are genuine, and alternative safe and legal routes have been closed. It’s ineffective, as a deterrent works only if it’s known. It’s illegal, as it fails to deal properly with refugees. And it’s unethical and cruel. Perhaps most bizarre of all, Rees-Mogg asserts that it’s ’redemptive’. My view is much as Pope Francis’.\nApril 11th: Rishi Sunak impressed the public with his charm, confidence and ‘generosity’ with public spending. Many (including him!) thought he might be the next Prime Minister, but I always wondered – we knew nothing of any vision for the UK, ability in managing the executive decision-making or skill in building and managing a team. We did know that he’d been a hedge-fund manager, good at making money from insubstantial investments and manipulation of markets. In the past few weeks, his fall from grace has been spectacular – a budget that failed to address the cost-of-living crisis, apparent opposition to sensible energy/climate plans, and then his wife’s non-dom status for her fantastic wealth. Then, on top of all that. questions about his US and UK status.\nOn Thursday I was visiting Richmond in North Yorkshire, his constituency, and was by chance interviewed by an ITV team seeking the views of local residents. They featured my views at some length: https://twitter.com/ITVNewsPolitics/status/1512098733554610187 Some of the comments following the clip are hilarious! I was quite honest with them about who I was but they evidently thought the clip worth keeping. The whole tweet was re-tweeted by Wes Streeting (Shadow Cabinet), so it had lots of views!\nApril 6th: Today the National Insurance increase is implemented. On top of huge rises in energy costs, and a continuing squeeze on benefits and local authority budgets, times will be hard for many families. Yes, it’s possible to manage on less, and people used to know more about how to do that, but life wasn’t very good for many in those ‘nostalgic times’, and in any case, why should ordinary families be told to put up with things by people who don’t have to? When coupled with a casual and hypocritical attitude to the pandemic rules by Downing street, it’s clear that this Government is seriously out of touch. Many people remain to be convinced that Labour is ready for government, but increasingly they (and the Liberal Democrats) are seen as a serious party who cares.\nThe Government is also out of touch on other issues. Most people oppose the selling off of Channel 4 – pointless except as a piece of dogma. Most people are supportive of more on-shore wind turbines and against fracking, yet the Government is against one and favours the other. People support more Ukrainian refugees, but the Home Office makes that very difficult. They appear to be completely wrapped up in their own rhetoric. It’s to be hoped that they lose power sooner rather than later!\nThe immediate prospect of a challenge to the Government will come on May 5th in the local elections. Although primarily about local issues, and distorted to some extent by dissatisfaction that results from national funding but which impinges on other parties, it seems likely that many usual Conservative voters will stay at home, whilst opposition voters will turn out with greater enthusiasm. In North Tyneside, there are prospects of more opposition councillors from the Lib Dems and the Greens, who both had impressive gains in target wards. Although the overall political ‘colour’ of the two is very different, we share the aims of addressing the climate change, holding the local council to account, and scrutinising plans and decisions to set better priorities and ensure value for money.\nMarch 14th: I’ve just watched short videos of arrests in Russian cities – one of a protestor with a card saying, literally, ‘two words’, and the other with a card that was completely blank. The Russian government is afraid of criticism. Much of its attitude is even more rooted in the past than Britain’s current nostalgia of ‘Dad’s Army’ and ‘Britannia rules the waves’.\nBut it’s also true that our governments have failed to tell the truth, in the sense of both words and actions. The belief that economic engagement would convert Russia, China and other autocracies to our liberal democracy was naive. Of course engagement, and particularly educating foreign students, is part of what’s needed, but sterner stuff must also be shown when such trust is clearly abused, as in Salisbury, Crimea, Syria, and substantial dependence on Russian energy supplies was a real risk, especially coupled with inadequate storage.\nAt the same time, our governments have failed to be honest with us about the need to pay our way – in taxes sufficient to provide the services we value, and in balancing our trade so that foreign investment can be selective rather than uncritical. The ‘golden visa’ scheme was always a terrible idea (actually introduced under Gordon Brown!), but should at least have had safeguards, notably a restriction on political donations for an initial period.\nIt’s commonplace to say ‘they’re all liars’ about our politicians, whilst expecting unrealistic things to be done, and voting for the best promises rather than the honest but more mundane ‘we’ll do what we can’. Vision is great, exaggerated promises are not.\nFebruary 8th: I decided some years ago that I hate dogma. That’s not a particular dogma, just all of it! There might be a very few exceptions, but these would be a few ‘truths’ for me, such as statements about the importance of truth itself, honesty, the value of human beings, the need to look after the world for the sake of our children and grandchildren, etc.\nDogma means (to me) an explicit statement of a belief that the holder is unwilling to question. I have no objection to strong beliefs, strongly argued, it’s the closed-mindedness that’s the problem, the ‘black-and-white’ view of the subject or the world. Just now, it’s party politics that’s at the forefront of my mind, but I will mention one other area.\nBoris Johnson shouldn’t be Prime Minister. Increasingly, that’s a view held by many Conservative voters and MPs, as well as almost all others. It’s commonly said that by continuing to support him in post, those people are ‘putting party before country’, or ‘putting their own careers before principles’. I don’t think it’s so simple, though I’m not excusing it. It’s clear to me that for many of these MPs (and voters), there is a strong conviction that a Conservative government is best for the country, certainly in the longer-term and probably in the medium-term too. That is, even with doubts and problems at present, they continue to think that a Labour government will be worse for the country overall than almost any conceivable government by ‘their’ party. In this sense, they might believe they are putting country before anything else. Of course, an element of personal career is relevant, but the argument extends easily to: ‘I’ll be a better MP for my constituency than my opponent, because of my core values.’\nWhilst I understand this mentality up to a point, it’s dangerous, as it can lead incrementally to acceptance, even advocacy, of bad policy, bad behaviour, bad management, etc. Surely most Conservative MPs would not have supported Johnson so willingly in 2019 if they’d known in advance how he might behave, how little he valued them, their opinions, their values.\nA dogmatic position that says, in effect: any Conservative government, however bad, is always better than any Labour government, however good, is not a rational position, it’s a black-and-white dogma and should be called out and given no power. Of course, the same would be true for the converse.\nHere’s my other example: When I was young, homosexuality was unknown, then weird, then a joke, then strange, then gradually more a fact of life. However, until I was about 25-30, I wasn’t wholly comfortable with this, whilst trying hard to be accepting. What finally brought me ‘off the fence’ was this: To hold the traditional view (of heterosexual lifelong marriage) was, in effect, to judge that any traditional marriage relationship, however bad, was automatically better than any other form of relationship, however good. That is, a dogmatic traditional position was clearly wrong and untenable for me. Thereafter, I accepted the validity and value of all good, committed, respectful relationships, hetero- or homo-sexual, whilst still rejecting any relationship that didn’t meet those values, or didn’t try hard to. I could add other rejected dogmas to these two, but that’s enough for today!\nJanuary 23rd: Boris Johnson is on the ropes, by all accounts and appearances. Parties (in no.10, in the garden, in his flat), threats to MPs, Islamophobia, on top of general dishonesty and incompetence, factional strife in his Party, and a growing cost-of-living crisis contribute to, at last, public opinion that he should resign or be sacked, with someone competent and honest in his place. Will it happen? Yes! Will it happen this week? Unclear.\nWho would replace him? Sunak is front-runner, but we have no idea of his vision or competence, just his manner, and he has apparently little sympathy for the poor or the environment. If he takes over, then I hope the many problems are not shrugged off by him as ‘not his fault’, as any incoming PM must be seen to do something to alleviate them. I hope too that he doesn’t take over soon enough to get the benefit of the doubt in the May elections, but late enough for his competence to be as yet unclear.\nPM is a job I’ll never have and couldn’t do, as my skin isn’t thick enough even if I had the ability! However, I sometimes think of what my first priorities might be in that position. Top of the list would be to reduce hostility and polarisation in Parliament, in the UK, with our European neighbours and beyond, for without that little effective governance is possible. I’d stop the hostility to asylum-seekers, but maybe process some in France if possible, with a clearer legal route otherwise to minimise the ‘boats’ problem.\nI’d maintain masks in most indoor places to slow the pandemic, and slow the NHS vaccination deadline just a little to get more acceptance. I’d have a windfall tax on energy companies to offset the recent price rises and/or other costs on the poor.\nFor NI, I’d agree an SPS deal to ease the customs and border issues, and with the EU fix collaborations on Euratom, Horizon, and the musicians visa scheme. I’d revisit the Australia trade deal if possible to reinstate welfare and environmental standards.\nThere’s lots more! Much of the above doesn’t bring massive costs, but increases cooperation and trust, and partially tackles several crises. Good governance is more about the mundane than the dramatic, but honesty, trust and steady, small steps are usually the best way forward.",
  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_author_johnapplebyld_page_5/content_88.html": "May 27th: The Sue Gray report is out – enough there to destroy any normal Prime Minister, but perhaps not this one. Rumblings from discontented backbenchers and former ministers, but nervousness that an attempt to unseat him will fail and make things worse. He should never have been shortlisted for the membership to vote on a leader, just as Corbyn shouldn’t have been for Labour, giving the electorate an invidious choice in 2019. It’s nonsense to think there’s no suitable replacement, though some talented and (more) principled MPs might be reluctant to spend two years mopping up only to lose a General Election and share some of the blame.\nAnd a huge £15bn support package, whilst essential, looks like both an attempted distraction and a complete contradiction of what’s been said and believed by this Government. Their MPs were whipped only a few days ago to vote against a windfall tax, which Labour are now crowing about, but which in fact was called for by the Lib Dems some months earlier!\nMay 19th: The Met Police were reluctant to investigate lockdown parties at no. 10, presumably thinking they’d be accused of political interference whatever their findings. They were eventually persuaded to look into twelve events, and investigated eight of them, finally issuing Fixed Penalty Notices to 126 people. But Boris Johnson received just one £50 fine, despite at least ‘dropping in’ to several parties, apparently on the flimsy basis that no. 10 is his home and so he was working in most cases. However, junior civil servants who cooperated initially with the Sue Gray internal report have been issued with many of the fines, possibly partially as a result of their confessions. They are reportedly furious!\nDurham police are, meanwhile, investigatingone event that Keir Starmer was at. If they find Starmer guilty of an offence (for which he’s promised to resign), that would seem grossly unfair, as there was clearly no culture of negligence in his case, at most a marginal misinterpretation of the rules. I trust that their investigation is to demonstrate political neutrality, knowing that the Government was under investigation.\nMaybe the Sue Gray report will strengthen the case that the Government, and Johnson in particular, were careless, negligent, dismissive, arrogant. I do hope that the public will continue to grow in their distrust of this selfish, arrogant and dishonest man, so that either he’s forced out of office or that he leads his party to a truly dreadful result in the General Election that must come by 2024.\nMay 9th: A huge shock for the Government, losing 487 council seats, consistently down in the polls, and with Labour more trusted than them on almost every criterion. But bigger still, they are threatened in their heartlands, particularly the South and South-West, by the Liberal Democrat surge, gaining 222 seats and 3 councils (returning to the same number of controlled councils as c. 2010). After Chesham & Amersham and North Shropshire, there are two tasty by-elections coming up too. The Government is finally looking very vulnerable.\nMay 4th: Many Conservative councillors are distancing themselves from their own party in government, with slogans such as ‘Local Conservatives’ and, even further, ‘Don’t punish local Conservatives for the mistakes made in Westminster’. The North Tyneside group have published pseudo-Green leaflets aiming to get some Labour voters to switch and save a few marginal Tory councillors. A tiny imprint has ‘NTCF’ (Conservative Federation), but for most people they look like Green Party leaflets, which they’re not! After all, it was local Conservative members who voted in Johnson as leader and hence Prime Minister, when his character and history were well-known.\nThis distancing is not new. During the Coalition years (whatever you think of that period), many local Lib Dem councillors lost their seats owing to general unhappiness with the national policies and compromises, and some campaigned with the designation ‘Focus Team’ and no mention of ‘Liberal Democrat’. I doubt this is effective and might even be counter-productive.\nBy Friday morning, we’ll see if there is indeed a substantial national swing in seat numbers, but it will be measured against 2018, when Theresa May’s government was already unpopular. Locally, the Lib Dems have a strong challenge in Weetslade ward, and the Greens in Whitley Bay. We share some aims (environment, and the need for scrutiny and challenge to this Labour ‘one-party state’), but remain distinct parties, especially at national level, where the Greens try to defend their ‘leave NATO’ policy – not at all sensible at this time!\nApril 19th: Desperate to displace headlines about lawbreaking at Number 10, and to shore up their ’base’, this dreadful Government have proposed an appalling plan for refugees – condemned by almost everyone who’s thought about the issue at all. The Civil Service are constrained, but have said it’s unclear whether it will be effective and hence value for money. It’s dishonest in that the UK takes a relatively small number of refugees, most of those crossing the Channel are genuine, and alternative safe and legal routes have been closed. It’s ineffective, as a deterrent works only if it’s known. It’s illegal, as it fails to deal properly with refugees. And it’s unethical and cruel. Perhaps most bizarre of all, Rees-Mogg asserts that it’s ’redemptive’. My view is much as Pope Francis’.\nApril 11th: Rishi Sunak impressed the public with his charm, confidence and ‘generosity’ with public spending. Many (including him!) thought he might be the next Prime Minister, but I always wondered – we knew nothing of any vision for the UK, ability in managing the executive decision-making or skill in building and managing a team. We did know that he’d been a hedge-fund manager, good at making money from insubstantial investments and manipulation of markets. In the past few weeks, his fall from grace has been spectacular – a budget that failed to address the cost-of-living crisis, apparent opposition to sensible energy/climate plans, and then his wife’s non-dom status for her fantastic wealth. Then, on top of all that. questions about his US and UK status.\nOn Thursday I was visiting Richmond in North Yorkshire, his constituency, and was by chance interviewed by an ITV team seeking the views of local residents. They featured my views at some length: https://twitter.com/ITVNewsPolitics/status/1512098733554610187 Some of the comments following the clip are hilarious! I was quite honest with them about who I was but they evidently thought the clip worth keeping. The whole tweet was re-tweeted by Wes Streeting (Shadow Cabinet), so it had lots of views!\nApril 6th: Today the National Insurance increase is implemented. On top of huge rises in energy costs, and a continuing squeeze on benefits and local authority budgets, times will be hard for many families. Yes, it’s possible to manage on less, and people used to know more about how to do that, but life wasn’t very good for many in those ‘nostalgic times’, and in any case, why should ordinary families be told to put up with things by people who don’t have to? When coupled with a casual and hypocritical attitude to the pandemic rules by Downing street, it’s clear that this Government is seriously out of touch. Many people remain to be convinced that Labour is ready for government, but increasingly they (and the Liberal Democrats) are seen as a serious party who cares.\nThe Government is also out of touch on other issues. Most people oppose the selling off of Channel 4 – pointless except as a piece of dogma. Most people are supportive of more on-shore wind turbines and against fracking, yet the Government is against one and favours the other. People support more Ukrainian refugees, but the Home Office makes that very difficult. They appear to be completely wrapped up in their own rhetoric. It’s to be hoped that they lose power sooner rather than later!\nThe immediate prospect of a challenge to the Government will come on May 5th in the local elections. Although primarily about local issues, and distorted to some extent by dissatisfaction that results from national funding but which impinges on other parties, it seems likely that many usual Conservative voters will stay at home, whilst opposition voters will turn out with greater enthusiasm. In North Tyneside, there are prospects of more opposition councillors from the Lib Dems and the Greens, who both had impressive gains in target wards. Although the overall political ‘colour’ of the two is very different, we share the aims of addressing the climate change, holding the local council to account, and scrutinising plans and decisions to set better priorities and ensure value for money.\nMarch 14th: I’ve just watched short videos of arrests in Russian cities – one of a protestor with a card saying, literally, ‘two words’, and the other with a card that was completely blank. The Russian government is afraid of criticism. Much of its attitude is even more rooted in the past than Britain’s current nostalgia of ‘Dad’s Army’ and ‘Britannia rules the waves’.\nBut it’s also true that our governments have failed to tell the truth, in the sense of both words and actions. The belief that economic engagement would convert Russia, China and other autocracies to our liberal democracy was naive. Of course engagement, and particularly educating foreign students, is part of what’s needed, but sterner stuff must also be shown when such trust is clearly abused, as in Salisbury, Crimea, Syria, and substantial dependence on Russian energy supplies was a real risk, especially coupled with inadequate storage.\nAt the same time, our governments have failed to be honest with us about the need to pay our way – in taxes sufficient to provide the services we value, and in balancing our trade so that foreign investment can be selective rather than uncritical.

  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_news-from-john-appleby_page_4/content_101.html": "March 2nd: Our inept Prime Minister, shackled to an almost hysterical right-wing, and facing electoral oblivion, makes a public speech about extremism and ‘mob rule’. I’ve said before that the thing I have most hated about the Governments we’ve had since 2016 (i.e. Johnson, May, Truss, Sunak) is that they have created, encouraged, even stoked, division between people, between communities, between countries.\nSurely one of the most important functions of leadership – true for managing a department or even being a parent, as well as in politics – is to reduce suspicion and hostility, to build trust, to try to bring people together in a common vision? Obviously simplistic nationalism isn’t what I mean (such as Modi’s BJP in India), but a common vision that everybody, if possible, can see the point of and feel that they or their children and friends might find good in wellbeing if not in material wealth.\nFebruary 12th 2024: The general mood right now for most people seems to be ‘Anything but this!’ For many, that means voting for the candidate most likely to unseat a Conservative, even if that individual has behaved (mostly) honourably. For many others, it means ‘I’m not voting for them, nor for any of the others!’. This is not a healthy situation.\nKeir Starmer is evidently a cautious person. He’s very conscious of what happened in 1992, when Labour had a fair lead in the polls, yet John Major and the Conservatives won. The margin in the polls is far larger now, but he clearly doesn’t want to take things for granted, and also doesn’t want to promise what he can’t deliver, in case he leads a one-term government.\nHowever, it would be good to have more of a sense of vision and hope, instead of dull competence, even though that’s what’s more important in getting our society back on track as a functioning and civil country. He no doubts wants to be radical on the climate too, but has managed to give a very confused message on that. If the markets can accept Labour’s initial plans and track record, I really hope he’ll revive that necessary huge investment before long.\nBut I can’t pretend that a majority Labour government is my preferred option. I’d like the Lib Dems to get 30-50 seats, return to being the third largest party (2nd largest is too much to hope, I think), and have a real share in decision-making. Let’s see.\nAugust 4th: Why does our Government continue to do things that seem irrational and counter-productive? Why not join the Horizon programme? Why license new oil and gas fields? Why announce that shoplifters will go to jail? Why don’t they seem to care about sewage in our rivers, and doctors and teachers leaving their professions in huge numbers, or whether we are taken seriously by our international partners? Are they stupid? Are their advisers all stupid too? Are their civil-servants not pointing out the ineffectiveness (at best) of these disjointed, erratic and naive policties?\nIs it just that it makes more profit for their rich mates? I think not. No doubt they are so used to spending time with other privileged people that their judgement is affected. We’re all more inclined to trust those like us, our friends and those of a type we know. We flatter ourselves that we understand them and they us, that they are more likely to deliver what we intend than anonymous corporations. This surely underlies to a large extent the system of patronage over the years in promotions etc. Not all purely selfish, but also unconscious bias.\nBut there is another, quite different, rationale. In 2019, Johnson perceived that UKIP might contest many existing Conservative seats, and others he hoped to win, not by winning them, but by splitting the conservative vote. He tacked to the right, and UKIP stood down in all seats held by Conservatives that supported Brexit.\nFor the 2024 General Election, the Conservatives must surely know that they’re likely to lose, and by a substantial margin. They could easily drop to 200 seats (as Labour has now). But if Reform (ex-UKIP) contests many seats, that 200 could instead be 50-100 – a near wipe-out for the party. That’s what terrifies the Conservative Party. If they try to appear more moderate, they might regain some votes from the centre-ground, but they might lose far more seats through that split vote.\nI think our inept, unimaginative and corrupt government has realised it’s going to lose badly next year, and its strategy is to avoid a wipe-out. I really find it hard to believe there’s any other rationale for continuing to adopt such stupid policies.\nJune 19th: A day to remember – the House of Commons debating the Privileges Committee report into Boris Johnson’s deliberate misleading of the House, and his subsequent rubbishing of the process and the individuals bravely producing the report. A bad day – that it was necessary, and that many Conservative MPs stayed away (very few opposed the report). A good day – that the HoC could be honest about the shenanigans of Johnson’s regime and his personal unsuitability to be Prime Minister.\nAnd, this week, a ‘stolen’ video displaying the carelessness and contempt for the public and for shared mores as Shaun Bailey’s Mayoral team at CCHQ partied on the same day we were instructed to return to social restrictions.\nHonesty in politicians means avoiding deliberate untruths or grossly misleading statements, as a minimum, but also means not promising things that there is no realistic chance of delivering. One shortlisted candidate for the expanded North-East Mayor says they’ll ‘eliminate child poverty’ – a laudable but impossible aim. They should really say ‘reducing child poverty is my principal aim’ and perhaps ‘we should be able to eliminate child poverty, and I’ll do my best to reduce it substantially in my five year term’.\nIt’s generally understood that Cameron promised a referendum that he thought he’d be forced to drop in a hung parliament, that Clegg promised no student fee increase as he didn’t expect to be in power, and that Johnson urged a Brexit that he didn’t believe in. Only the last was a complete falsehood, but the others were rash at least, and came back to haunt us all.\nMay 2nd: I get on fine with reasonable members of major parties, Labour, Conservative, Green (I don’t meet many SNP members, but probably them too). I do not get on with those who hold dogmatic positions, defying logic, ignoring facts, being insulting to others.\nPeople should vote quite separately for local and parliamentary elections, as the issues are often different and the individuals too. A local council might be doing well despite being the same party as a bad government, or vice versa. Of course there’s going to be some overlap – local parties and national parties are likely to have related priorities and assumptions about the mix of private and public, individual and state, both with respect to responsibilities and to economic mechanisms. But I respect those who vote for an excellent candidate even where that party isn’t their ‘usual’ one.\nHowever, at present this Government is so bad, so dishonest, so incompetent, that I’d rather they got a clear signal this week that it’s time for them to acknowledge defeat and give way to others with energy, ideas and integrity.\nFebruary 14th: I’m often accused of being too charitable to those who seem corrupt or crazy. Perhaps I am. But my experience is that people are often less corrupt and/or less crazy than they first appear. Moreover, in the case of politics, those who vote for what seem stupid or malign policies are unlikely to be convinced by our viewing those representatives in the worst possible light. So this is an attempt to ‘defend’ a significant minority of Conservative MPs who continue to vote with the Government even though they seem decent enough as people. This is not any defence of the policies, nor a full justification for their continuing support.\nTraditional, one-nation Conservatism, and moderate, democratic Socialism, can have constructive discussions with each other, with a fair amount of consensus on what’s acceptable both to the public and in parliamentary processes. They also agree that change must happen gradually.\nThey agree on a mixed economy, but disagree about the mix, the balance between public and private finance, and between individual and collective responsibility.\nThe Cabinet (most of them) must know that Brexit has been hugely damaging, that leaving the ECHR would be insane, that scrapping EU laws without discussion or replacement would be disastrous. The only (sane) reason for these proposals at all is that they know they’re going to lose the next General Election, badly, but think their only hope of avoiding huge losses (resulting in < 100 seats?) is to keep sufficient core voters who might support Reform. Any attempt to appeal to swing Con/Lab or Con/LD voters could cost far more than it would gain.\nMeanwhile, the ‘sensible’ Conservative MPs want their party to regain its pragmatism and caution. They know they’ll lose many seats at the next General Election, but hope that they can retain enough to form a substantial Opposition, and then re-form a parliamentary group capable of governing. But if they rebel now, they might fail to prevent whatever policy it is, create even more of an impression of incompetence, and feed the populist appetite leaking votes to Reform. They might also be de-selected (as in 2019). Thus they continue to conform, hoping to keep their own seats and a future, sensible Party.\nSome Ministers might feel similarly, though they’re deeper in the collective insanity of making enemies, damaging trade, reducing Britain’s influence, weakening our universities, etc. But maybe a few (like one or two of Trump’s lieutenants?) think that the UK would be even worse off without their moderating voice in Cabinet.\nOf course, I might be wrong. Many MPs are just in the habit of voting with their own Government, and fearful of losing their seats, even if they’re not personally corrupt.\nNovember 16th: Common UK views have moved from ‘In God we trust’ through ‘With Truss, “Oh my God!”‘ to a weary fatalism now Rishi Sunak holds the reins – ‘God knows what’s coming next!’.\nBack in the Spring, Sunak’s wife’s non-dom status became known, and by chance I was interviewed in his constituency of Richmond as if I were a resident (but I did tell ITV!). The comments after this clip are hilarious! It got extra coverage when re-tweeted by a member of the Shadow Cabinet!\nI haven’t changed my views since the early days of ‘Dishy Rishi’, when I said we knew nothing about his vision or skills – now both clearly lacking – although he does seem more decent and a bit more honest than some of his colleagues. HIs judgement though – Braverman and Williamson and Raab. How long can he last?\nOctober 18th: What a summer! My last entry, on 18th July, ended with this: “Whoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.”\nWell, our new PM got no ‘bounce’ at all, but maybe at least isn’t an inveterate liar. In fact, she tried to enact roughly what she promised to those few Conservative members, whereas most of us assumed she’d be more moderate in practice once she’d got the job! She did indeed ‘adopt really stupid policies’, but perhaps not primarily to get populist approval but because she’d fallen hook, line and sinker for ‘Minfordnomics’.\nPatrick Minford argued that Brexit would benefit the UK, but was quite open about his view that it would lead to decline in UK farming and industry. I think his logic was, if it can be produced more cheaply elsewhere, let that happen, whilst we do what we’re best at. This of course ignores the fact that much of our trade was with Europe, now more difficult and costly. It also ignores the security of home production (very obvious now with increased conflict) and the dignity and pride of things done at home.

The debates on TV, in the press and on Twitter have brought us little honesty, few ideas, and much mud-slinging about the candidates’ own involvement and about each other. The third TV debate has been cancelled as two leading candidates could see these pubic viewings were just making them all look bad. Recall that Johnson refused to participate in all but one TV debate in 2019 and also swerved the hardest interview experienced by the other leaders in the 2019 General Election.\nWhoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.\nJune 21st: Rail strikes today, and the Government tries to blame this on Labour, who haven’t been in power for twelve years!

  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_news-from-john-appleby_page_4/content_100.html": "March 2nd: Our inept Prime Minister, shackled to an almost hysterical right-wing, and facing electoral oblivion, makes a public speech about extremism and ‘mob rule’. I’ve said before that the thing I have most hated about the Governments we’ve had since 2016 (i.e. Johnson, May, Truss, Sunak) is that they have created, encouraged, even stoked, division between people, between communities, between countries.\nSurely one of the most important functions of leadership – true for managing a department or even being a parent, as well as in politics – is to reduce suspicion and hostility, to build trust, to try to bring people together in a common vision? Obviously simplistic nationalism isn’t what I mean (such as Modi’s BJP in India), but a common vision that everybody, if possible, can see the point of and feel that they or their children and friends might find good in wellbeing if not in material wealth.\nFebruary 12th 2024: The general mood right now for most people seems to be ‘Anything but this!’ For many, that means voting for the candidate most likely to unseat a Conservative, even if that individual has behaved (mostly) honourably. For many others, it means ‘I’m not voting for them, nor for any of the others!’. This is not a healthy situation.\nKeir Starmer is evidently a cautious person. He’s very conscious of what happened in 1992, when Labour had a fair lead in the polls, yet John Major and the Conservatives won. The margin in the polls is far larger now, but he clearly doesn’t want to take things for granted, and also doesn’t want to promise what he can’t deliver, in case he leads a one-term government.\nHowever, it would be good to have more of a sense of vision and hope, instead of dull competence, even though that’s what’s more important in getting our society back on track as a functioning and civil country. He no doubts wants to be radical on the climate too, but has managed to give a very confused message on that. If the markets can accept Labour’s initial plans and track record, I really hope he’ll revive that necessary huge investment before long.\nBut I can’t pretend that a majority Labour government is my preferred option. I’d like the Lib Dems to get 30-50 seats, return to being the third largest party (2nd largest is too much to hope, I think), and have a real share in decision-making. Let’s see.\nAugust 4th: Why does our Government continue to do things that seem irrational and counter-productive? Why not join the Horizon programme? Why license new oil and gas fields? Why announce that shoplifters will go to jail? Why don’t they seem to care about sewage in our rivers, and doctors and teachers leaving their professions in huge numbers, or whether we are taken seriously by our international partners? Are they stupid? Are their advisers all stupid too? Are their civil-servants not pointing out the ineffectiveness (at best) of these disjointed, erratic and naive policties?\nIs it just that it makes more profit for their rich mates? I think not. No doubt they are so used to spending time with other privileged people that their judgement is affected. We’re all more inclined to trust those like us, our friends and those of a type we know. We flatter ourselves that we understand them and they us, that they are more likely to deliver what we intend than anonymous corporations. This surely underlies to a large extent the system of patronage over the years in promotions etc. Not all purely selfish, but also unconscious bias.\nBut there is another, quite different, rationale. In 2019, Johnson perceived that UKIP might contest many existing Conservative seats, and others he hoped to win, not by winning them, but by splitting the conservative vote. He tacked to the right, and UKIP stood down in all seats held by Conservatives that supported Brexit.\nFor the 2024 General Election, the Conservatives must surely know that they’re likely to lose, and by a substantial margin. They could easily drop to 200 seats (as Labour has now). But if Reform (ex-UKIP) contests many seats, that 200 could instead be 50-100 – a near wipe-out for the party. That’s what terrifies the Conservative Party. If they try to appear more moderate, they might regain some votes from the centre-ground, but they might lose far more seats through that split vote.\nI think our inept, unimaginative and corrupt government has realised it’s going to lose badly next year, and its strategy is to avoid a wipe-out. I really find it hard to believe there’s any other rationale for continuing to adopt such stupid policies.\nJune 19th: A day to remember – the House of Commons debating the Privileges Committee report into Boris Johnson’s deliberate misleading of the House, and his subsequent rubbishing of the process and the individuals bravely producing the report. A bad day – that it was necessary, and that many Conservative MPs stayed away (very few opposed the report). A good day – that the HoC could be honest about the shenanigans of Johnson’s regime and his personal unsuitability to be Prime Minister.\nAnd, this week, a ‘stolen’ video displaying the carelessness and contempt for the public and for shared mores as Shaun Bailey’s Mayoral team at CCHQ partied on the same day we were instructed to return to social restrictions.\nHonesty in politicians means avoiding deliberate untruths or grossly misleading statements, as a minimum, but also means not promising things that there is no realistic chance of delivering. One shortlisted candidate for the expanded North-East Mayor says they’ll ‘eliminate child poverty’ – a laudable but impossible aim. They should really say ‘reducing child poverty is my principal aim’ and perhaps ‘we should be able to eliminate child poverty, and I’ll do my best to reduce it substantially in my five year term’.\nIt’s generally understood that Cameron promised a referendum that he thought he’d be forced to drop in a hung parliament, that Clegg promised no student fee increase as he didn’t expect to be in power, and that Johnson urged a Brexit that he didn’t believe in. Only the last was a complete falsehood, but the others were rash at least, and came back to haunt us all.\nMay 2nd: I get on fine with reasonable members of major parties, Labour, Conservative, Green (I don’t meet many SNP members, but probably them too). I do not get on with those who hold dogmatic positions, defying logic, ignoring facts, being insulting to others.\nPeople should vote quite separately for local and parliamentary elections, as the issues are often different and the individuals too. A local council might be doing well despite being the same party as a bad government, or vice versa. Of course there’s going to be some overlap – local parties and national parties are likely to have related priorities and assumptions about the mix of private and public, individual and state, both with respect to responsibilities and to economic mechanisms. But I respect those who vote for an excellent candidate even where that party isn’t their ‘usual’ one.\nHowever, at present this Government is so bad, so dishonest, so incompetent, that I’d rather they got a clear signal this week that it’s time for them to acknowledge defeat and give way to others with energy, ideas and integrity.\nFebruary 14th: I’m often accused of being too charitable to those who seem corrupt or crazy. Perhaps I am. But my experience is that people are often less corrupt and/or less crazy than they first appear. Moreover, in the case of politics, those who vote for what seem stupid or malign policies are unlikely to be convinced by our viewing those representatives in the worst possible light. So this is an attempt to ‘defend’ a significant minority of Conservative MPs who continue to vote with the Government even though they seem decent enough as people. This is not any defence of the policies, nor a full justification for their continuing support.\nTraditional, one-nation Conservatism, and moderate, democratic Socialism, can have constructive discussions with each other, with a fair amount of consensus on what’s acceptable both to the public and in parliamentary processes. They also agree that change must happen gradually.\nThey agree on a mixed economy, but disagree about the mix, the balance between public and private finance, and between individual and collective responsibility.\nThe Cabinet (most of them) must know that Brexit has been hugely damaging, that leaving the ECHR would be insane, that scrapping EU laws without discussion or replacement would be disastrous. The only (sane) reason for these proposals at all is that they know they’re going to lose the next General Election, badly, but think their only hope of avoiding huge losses (resulting in < 100 seats?) is to keep sufficient core voters who might support Reform. Any attempt to appeal to swing Con/Lab or Con/LD voters could cost far more than it would gain.\nMeanwhile, the ‘sensible’ Conservative MPs want their party to regain its pragmatism and caution. They know they’ll lose many seats at the next General Election, but hope that they can retain enough to form a substantial Opposition, and then re-form a parliamentary group capable of governing. But if they rebel now, they might fail to prevent whatever policy it is, create even more of an impression of incompetence, and feed the populist appetite leaking votes to Reform. They might also be de-selected (as in 2019). Thus they continue to conform, hoping to keep their own seats and a future, sensible Party.\nSome Ministers might feel similarly, though they’re deeper in the collective insanity of making enemies, damaging trade, reducing Britain’s influence, weakening our universities, etc. But maybe a few (like one or two of Trump’s lieutenants?) think that the UK would be even worse off without their moderating voice in Cabinet.\nOf course, I might be wrong. Many MPs are just in the habit of voting with their own Government, and fearful of losing their seats, even if they’re not personally corrupt.\nNovember 16th: Common UK views have moved from ‘In God we trust’ through ‘With Truss, “Oh my God!”‘ to a weary fatalism now Rishi Sunak holds the reins – ‘God knows what’s coming next!’.\nBack in the Spring, Sunak’s wife’s non-dom status became known, and by chance I was interviewed in his constituency of Richmond as if I were a resident (but I did tell ITV!). The comments after this clip are hilarious! It got extra coverage when re-tweeted by a member of the Shadow Cabinet!\nI haven’t changed my views since the early days of ‘Dishy Rishi’, when I said we knew nothing about his vision or skills – now both clearly lacking – although he does seem more decent and a bit more honest than some of his colleagues. HIs judgement though – Braverman and Williamson and Raab. How long can he last?\nOctober 18th: What a summer! My last entry, on 18th July, ended with this: “Whoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.”\nWell, our new PM got no ‘bounce’ at all, but maybe at least isn’t an inveterate liar. In fact, she tried to enact roughly what she promised to those few Conservative members, whereas most of us assumed she’d be more moderate in practice once she’d got the job! She did indeed ‘adopt really stupid policies’, but perhaps not primarily to get populist approval but because she’d fallen hook, line and sinker for ‘Minfordnomics’.\nPatrick Minford argued that Brexit would benefit the UK, but was quite open about his view that it would lead to decline in UK farming and industry. I think his logic was, if it can be produced more cheaply elsewhere, let that happen, whilst we do what we’re best at. This of course ignores the fact that much of our trade was with Europe, now more difficult and costly. It also ignores the security of home production (very obvious now with increased conflict) and the dignity and pride of things done at home. Moreover, this ‘purely logical’ approach to economics is of the kind that argues full employment can be achieved if the wage levels are appropriate, ignoring the fact that those levels might be below starvation level.\nHunt has his limitations, but is more mature and able than the PMs and chancellors we’ve had for some years.

He put a modified Withdrawal Agreement to Parliament, and it agreed to continue with it for more debate (‘it passed Second Reading’). But then Parliament said it wanted more than the three days’ debate that Johnson allowed, and he refused, wasted time, and called this Election, claiming that ‘Parliament has blocked Brexit!’.\nThis is not true! Theresa May’s deal (better for the UK than Johnson’s, though both are bad) would have passed if the Tory right-wing and the DUP hadn’t blocked it, including Johnson himself. Now Parliament was willing to consider the modified deal, but insisted it should be properly scrutinised. Johnson wouldn’t accept that, either because he knew it wouldn’t stand up to scrutiny, or because he was afraid of amendments (perhaps including a second referendum to see if the public still wanted Brexit at all!).\nYou’ll find regular blog entries relating to the campaign period under my ‘News’ page. The second entry (posted 6th Nov) lists the Conservative gaffes of just the first day of campaigning!\nHere’s the full Liberal Democrat manifesto (released 20th Nov): http://www.libdems.org.uk/plan . Lots of exciting and visionary ideas, more thoroughly worked out than most parties bother with, and properly costed – no bidding war for us!\nI’ll be posting my own priorities – relevant to both the Tynemouth area and more widely in my blog or here. Much of what I posted in my campaign to be North of Tyne Mayor still applies – see the relevant page on this site. As a start, below you’ll see our Climate Emergency plan, recently announced by Ed Davey, former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate.\nMy personal profile is now listed on the national Lib Dem ‘Candidates’ page at: https://www.libdems.org.uk/candidates\nYou might like to look at this useful BBC page, which summarises the principal policies of all the parties and will be updated once full manifestos are published: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50291676\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has also analysed the principal manifestos: https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/manifestos\nThis states that: ” Liberal Democrat proposals to put a penny on the main rates of income tax would be simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue. While the Conservatives continue to pretend that tax rises will never be needed to secure decent public services, Labour pretends that huge increases in spending can be financed by just big companies and the rich. In this respect neither Labour nor the Conservatives is being honest with the electorate.”\nThe National Liberal Democrat headline message is:\nStop Brexit. Build a BRIGHter Future.\nMy top priorities are very clear:\n- Stop Brexit if possible, and minimise the damage to the North-East if not.\n- Accelerate action on the Environment – global warming, loss of biodiversity, plastic pollution\n- Help the North-East to flourish and have a stronger voice nationally.\nThe Liberal Democrats will spend £100bn on combating the climate emergency:\nThe Lib Dems have set out a clear plan to tackle the climate crisis. An extra £100bn will be pumped into combating climate change and protecting the environment. Across a five-year Parliament, Liberal Democrats will spend and invest an extra £100bn of public finance on climate action and environmental preservation.\nThis includes a new £10bn renewable power fund to leverage in over £100bn of extra private climate investment. This will fast-track deployment of clearn energy, to make Britain not just the world leader in offshore wind, but also the global number one in tidal power too.\nAnd we will invest £15bn more to make every building in the country greener, with an emergency ten-year programme to save energy and fuel.",

Whilst it didn’t reveal Russian interference in the Referendum, it did reveal that our Government made no effort to investigate the possibility of significant disruption to our democracy, despite warnings in 2014 and at other times, and despite the US doing just this after their 2016 elections. My view: that Theresa May (then PM) believed strongly that doubt cast on the Referendum result would damage the UK more than the result itself. This appears to include ignoring a proposal from our Intelligence Services to investigate Arron Banks before the referendum (maybe rather like Obama’s reluctance to make known FBI investigations into Trump in 2016, in case it looked like bias against him). I believe that she had an overdeveloped sense of duty, stronger than principle, that led to this neglect, and also to her attempt to deliver on the Tory manifesto promise to reduce immigration – and we’ve all seen how that worked out!\nHas corruption been a factor? As I’ve explained, I think probably not initially, but possibly now, as the pattern of the last decade allowing rich foreigners to acquire citizenship for a fee, then to donate to the Conservative party and to make friends with ministers, certainly seems to apply to the current PM and Cabinet. The ISC report does refer to this influence, which should embarrass all decent Conservative MPs (and there are many so, except for their support for Johnson & co.).\nWhat about Government contracts being awarded to friends of ministers without tender, and appointments made of known associates? My view is that this is corrupt, but not in the simplest form of ‘lining ones pockets’. Rather, it’s only too easy to think that people you know are the ones to trust, and that companies they recommend are likely to be reliable, and so on. But when you make friends with people like you, especially rich ones, this process becomes unaccountable and self-beneficial, and so corrupt, whilst the perpetrators can display injured innocence. Much the same applies to the need for democracy rather than choosing your supporters, something that Corbyn and his inner circle also were guilty of, claiming to represent members views over MPs until the members disagreed.\nThis is why we have proper processes – to avoid the temptation to work this way, and to be seen to work properly. Our current Government is not only corrupt and incompetent, but has also done much to destroy trust in government and sow division. It will take a long time to rebuild, but the esteem in which Keir Starmer is increasingly held shows that the public want a leader they can trust.",

So why are they silent on this?\nLast year, although most Labour supporters, and nearly all Lib Dem supporters, wanted to Remain, once Johnson got his majority, there was no stopping him (and it’s worth remembering that the General Election was called because the PM controlled HoC business and had withdrawn the Withdrawal Agreement, making ‘no-deal’ the default), so in 2020 the debate changed. I think both Davey and Starmer calculated that Johnson could be relied on to mess things up, and their job was to help that along, with the expectation that he’d look more and more ridiculous and dishonest. Avoiding giving him ammunition was Starmer’s idea, I think – let him stew in his own juice!\nAs well as avoiding the ‘it’s all the fault of Remoaners!’ tag, another key aim was to get the press turning against the Government – something that’s now happening. That works provided the Opposition doesn’t offer too many easy attack lines.\nFinally, we all hope that Johnson (who isn’t actually insane, completely stupid, and is probably well-advised usually) will agree some kind of deal with the EU at the last moment. As this will be a massive U-turn, and he’ll try to present that to his own party as a victory, the worst thing to do right now is to make that harder for him, almost to force him to stick to his own bad script. And what strengthens my conviction is that he is doing things to appease his right-wing (defence increases, public-sector pay freeze) that will make his U-turn less offensive to them. Much as we might despise the man, for dishonesty, selfishness, laziness, etc, surely we want him to concede what’s needed to the EU to avoid food shortages, closure of industry, the death of farming, and a general huge hit to the economy.\nHe’s painted himself into a corner. We might be gleeful about that, but it’s much more important just now to allow him to jump out of it. There’ll still be the pandemic, and a major shock to the economy, and I think both Davey and Starmer will pivot quite rapidly to being more ‘I told you so’ and pro-EU once the public can see the horrible mess Johnson and his shower have got us into.",

Here’s their questions and my responses:\nThe Children’s Society asked for my support for their manifesto (see: ). I added my name, and emailed them this response:\nThe Rail Forum posed some questions about Rail investment, from a business perspective. Here’s my response:\nSustain: the alliance for better food and farming\nSustain said: “We very much welcomed your party’s commitment to developing fairer and greener neighbourhoods and to protect small businesses. We believe there is a strong case for a North Tyneside Food partnership being instrumental in continuing this work and delivering long term commitments to these issues.” Here’s my response:\nThe Centenary Commission on Adult Education\nNational and International issues:\nEurope and Brexit\nSomeone challenged me on my views on Brexit, saying that I was ignoring the democratic vote to leave the EU. Firstly, I was strongly opposed to leaving, and any candidate can give their views. Secondly, I think major constitutional decisions should have a stronger mandate than 52% of those voting. Thirdly, it’s clear that most of the promises made by the Leave campaign, including our current Prime Minister, have been broken (massive bureaucratic barriers to trade, a border in the Irish sea, zero exports of shellfish, loss of rights of citizens, reduced security, loss of influence, no easy new trade deals, etc. etc.). A second Referendum on the actual deal should have been part of the offer, and was actually supported by Jacob Ress-Mogg! And last but not least, in the Tynemouth constituency, half of the North Tyneside borough, and the seat I contested in 2019, voted by 52:48 to stay in the EU! The borough overall voted 53% for Leave, but there’s a mix of opinions in every area, and it’s quite close here.\nStarting from here, we can’t simply rejoin and I’m not arguing for that, but we need to (a) rebuild trust and reduce tension, (b) try to reduce paperwork and obstacles to trade, (c) seriously consider joining the ‘outer ring’ of Europe – the EEA/EFTA – which would make trade easier but retain some of the freedoms sought.",

It’s very probable that the unions have been obstructive to new practices in some ways, and certain that the railways must find economies as fewer people commute. Nonetheless, rail companies make large profits at public expense, and it probably suits the Government to milk the situation to get a few more votes in the by-elections this week.\nThe ‘Boris tried to get his lover a job’ story is very curious. Trying to suppress an almost certainly true story seems pointless, but is probably a panic reaction, calculating that some core Tory voters in Tiverton and Honiton are more likely to be influenced by paper copies of their favourite newspapers than by the commentary. Why would the Times and Mail withdraw the story? What have they been promised? Is Johnson seriously considering a General Election once the by-election results are known, and in that case, has he offered the Times and Mail an exclusive?\nI’m an optimist, but the country does seem to be out of control at present. I don’t envy any new government trying to address so many difficulties – inflation, staff shortages, trade, Northern Ireland, the pandemic, Ukraine, but building trust and cooperation must be at the centre of any programme of government right now, and at any time. Labour isn’t to blame for most of the current crop of problems, but they do need some courage in projecting a vision that’s positive for people. That does seem to be lacking, and if the Tories do dump Johnson and find a more decent and competent leader, it might be hard for Starmer to be seen as the better choice.",

Business, and others, say that stability and confidence are the first requirement for a new Government, and surely there are some simple things that will improve morale quickly without much cost. For example, reducing or eliminating the restrictions on public protest, making Voter ID much simpler, finally settling some long-running disputes such as the Windrush scandal. Beyond that, an SPS agreement with the EU to smooth imports and reduce costs and bureaucracy, etc.\nBut I’d also really like some of the Lib Dem priorities – sorting out social care and looking after carers, stopping the sewage scandal, and stronger action on the Environment for a start!",
  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_local-elections-2022/content_26.html": "Results:\nMay 5th: We have a Labour Mayor of the new North-East region (seven local authorities) and a Labour Police & Crime Commissioner (six local authorities). See my Post on the PCC position and general views.\nIn the North Tyneside local elections, we put up five candidates but with minimal campaigning. Voters had three votes each, as all positions were up for election in the revised wards. Some put all three votes for one party, some ‘split’ their vote, and some used only one or two of their three choices. Our candidates did surprisingly well in view of our low profile, gaining from 322 votes in one ward to 507 in another. Perhaps there’s a more positive feeling around about the Lib Dems. The legacy of the Coalition years is ebbing, we expect more MPs by the end of 2024, and, once in power, Labour will attract much more criticism and might not get the easy ride it’s had in areas like this for the past decade.\nBefore the Election:\nAll the attention this year is on the incompetence and dishonesty of the current Conservative government, which is likely to be reflected once again in local election results (though those should really reflect local issues!). And we’re all waiting for that General Election!\nIn North Tyneside, all 60 councillors are up for election in 20 wards with modified boundaries and names. With our limited resources, we’re putting up candidates in just five wards. Without much campaigning, we don’t expect stellar results, but as electors have three votes, I anticipate that some will choose to ‘split’ their vote, perhaps giving one to the Lib Dem. Although the public are somewhat suspicious of changes to the voting system, they are also known to favour a ‘fairer’ system, and might not really want a massive Labour majority this year!\nAs well as the Local Elections, there’s an election for the Mayor of the expanded NE region (seven authorities). Our candidate is Dr Aidan King, a GP from Newcastle, who emphasises renewable energy and more. The Labour candidate is Kim McGuinness, currently PCC of Northumbria, and not seen as a strong candidate. Against her is the independent Jamie Driscoll, currently (ex-Labour) Mayor of the smaller ‘North of Tyne’ region. Despite the split in Labour support, we expect McGuinness to win for Labour, but with the Tories being so unpopular, we might even get a third place!\nFinally, there’s an election for the post of Police & Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, for which Dr John Appleby is the Lib Dem candidate. There’s usually little public or press interest in the PCC post. The Lib Dem policy is to replace these positions by regional boards, but whilst they exist, we’ll put up good candidates! John’s manifesto isn’t finalised, but will focus on prevention, especially work with young people, victim support, and maximising the time police spend on crime rather than other issues. Another vital area is the experience of women – domestic violence, rape prosecutions and other issues – the subject of a hustings being organised in late April.\nHere’s a quick view of John and his priorities, plus my brief manifesto. Also note you can find a list of all candidates and their personal statements at: https://choosemypcc.org.uk/area/northumbria/\nJohn:\n- Forty years living in the North-East\n- An experienced manager of people and budgets\n- A good communicator, never promises what he can’t deliver\n- Ex-councillor, trade union officer, school governor\n- Chairs a local charity, has lived in deprived areas\n- Environmental campaigner\nJohn wants to see:\n- Work with Young People both now and for the future\n- Listening to victims and the community and with more attention to domestic violence and the poor conviction rate for rape\n- Police spending less time on non-crime issues\n- Better detection and a timely justice system – the best deterrent\n- More and better probation to reduce re-offending\n- A local Police Board – better than a PCC\nI expect interest in the Lib Dems to grow substantially after a General Election, when we’ll have more MPs and when ousting this dreadful Government is no longer top priority!\nWatch this space!\nLocal Elections 2022 and 2023:\nIn 2023, the Lib Dems did well again nationally in seats and councils, though we had a limited showing in North Tyneside.\nIn 2022, across England, Wales and Scotland, the Liberal Democrats won 222 seats and 3 councils – great results, and showing a real prospect of gaining parliamentary seats in forthcoming by-elections and a future General Election.\nIn North Tyneside, our top target was Weetslade ward, where Daniel Elsom went from zero to hero last year with 829 votes (26%) and a good third place. This year, with lots of hard work from a small team, he gained 1064 votes (35%) and a strong second place, almost halving the gap from Labour, who were taking this area for granted. Maybe next year ….\nNotes made before the elections:\nIn 2022, North Tyneside has ‘usual’ local elections for one councillor in each of its twenty wards. Currently Labour hold 52 out of 60 positions – practically a ‘one-party state’, which is not healthy for scrutiny and challenge. The Labour candidate in my own ward seems to claim credit for everything that the Council has done, and that ‘only a Labour councillor can deliver ……’. If that’s true, it implies that other councillors and non-Labour wards will be disadvantaged – highly improper if not actually corrupt!\nIn 2020, local elections were cancelled. In 2021, pandemic restrictions led to a reduced requirement for nominations – only two signatures for each nomination instead of the usual ten – but this year we once again need ten names. In North Tyneside our Liberal Democrat group is contesting six wards as we need to concentrate our efforts with a small band of activists.\nFor our local priorities in Weetslade, where Daniel Elsom is again mounting a real challenge to Labour, see our Facebook pages at https://www.facebook.com/weetsladelibdems and https://www.facebook.com/NorthTyneLDs. For more general views about the borough and the region, see our posts on this site under ‘Previous Elections’.\nThe Liberal Democrats and the Green Party have some real, differences but share the aims of addressing the Climate Crisis, and of ensuring that this Labour-dominated authority gets the scrutiny it needs. The North Tyneside Green Party issued this statement: “The Green Party is committed to do everything possible to hold our council to account and to strengthen their response to the ongoing climate emergency. Our vision is one of a better, healthier and greener community, and we believe that a council with strong alternative voices will better represent our community and be more able to make that vision a reality. We are not campaigning in Weetslade this year, but will be happy to work with Liberal Democrat councillors, providing effective scrutiny of the Council’s priorities and decision-making, and ensuring vital issues aren’t forgotten.”\nFor the national Lib Dem priorities, see https://www.libdems.org.uk/plan\nLib Dem candidates for North Tyneside in 2023\nFor six of the twenty council wards in North Tyneside, the candidates are as follows:\n- Benton, Jed Beyer\n- Killingworth, Nathan Shone\n- Monkseaton North, David Nisbet\n- St Mary’s, Janet Appleby\n- Wallsend, Harriet Stanway\n- Weetslade, Daniel Elsom\nYoung people care now about the future – environment, education, lasting jobs. Three of our candidates are enthusiastic young candidates: Daniel, Nathan and Jed. They’d bring a breath of fresh air and not be satisfied with ‘staying calm and carrying on’ – we need to do better than that!\nIn Weetslade ward, campaigner and candidate Daniel Elsom is advocating Community Skips to allow residents to deposit major items for disposal and recycling, as the North Tyneside dump is far away, and current rules do not allow residents to use the much closer Newcastle Brunswick facility (obvious scope for co-operation here!). This would help residents, improve recycling, and reduce unsightly and dangerous fly-tipping. In 2021 he gained 25% of the vote in a ward we’d not contested in many years. One to watch!\nFuture elections\nLocal elections are scheduled for May 6th 2023, but as the Coronation has now been fixed for that day, it’s possible that this date will move. We’ll see!\nWith the Government in complete disarray, it’s quite possible there’ll be a General Election before long. We’ll certainly be fielding candidates in both the Tynemouth constituency and the North Tyneside constituency, but we haven’t yet finalised candidates for these. We have prepared Ward Profiles and Diversity Statements for any applicants wishing to stand in either seat.",

For us, ‘joining in’ with many thousands on-line to celebrate and look forward, but so different from normal. As new cases and numbers of deaths begin to level out, we hope for a vaccine, that new recognition of who and what is really important will not be lost amidst economic hardship, mental health, suffering in refugee camps. A few weeks more before we have any idea at all …..\nAuthor: johnapplebyld\nOur Community\nApril 3rd: Mounting cases, mounting numbers of deaths, confusion in Government (though with a little welcome honesty yesterday!), but some positives too. Our quiet street is developing a sense of community spirit. A Green/Red flag scheme so people can signal a need is in place, maybe not revealing needs if they are already under control, but showing a keen desire to look after each other. A WhatsApp group to share experiences and wants, whether a birthday, information about mail-order, or a wish for cheese or tofu! A nurse was isolated with her family for a few days, only to find her positive was a false positive and she’s back in the front-line. A seven-year-old’s birthday was marked communally with singing and music, including my own accordion in the street outside and my wife’s violin. We’ve already been booked for the proposed street-party at the end of lock-down.\nWill this community spirit continue when it’s all over? Obviously we don’t know, but at least we know more names and faces. Maybe this time will awaken people to what’s really important in life (beauty and friendship, rather than possessions), to the people they depend on who are often badly-paid and insecure, to the risks of unlimited foreign travel. I hope so.\nGovernment logic and its limitations\nMarch 28th: Our UK Gov’t has been much criticised. My interpretation is this. They believed (probably rightly) that nearly everyone would catch the virus before immunity and/or vaccine took effect. Therefore, it was pointless to try to delay the inevitable, including amongst medical staff, as economic harm would be bad and would also cause deaths. Moreover, the vast majority of deaths would be amongst the elderly, and would be those quite likely to die within the year (noting that the normal death rate in the UK is about 50,000 per month – rarely mentioned).\nWhat this also assumes, I think, is that people simply divide into those that die and those that don’t. What it leaves out is four things. Firstly, a significant minority of those who die might be saved with sufficient care, hence staffing and ventilators etc are needed. Secondly, a delay in the peak gives more time to develop treatments. Thirdly, it’s been said that a higher ‘load’ of the virus not only increases the chance of catching it, but also the severity of the illness – this is pertinent to medical staff and why PPE is important. Lastly, good treatment might make death less painful even where it’s inevitable. It’s also possible that, if many can avoid it altogether this year, a vaccine might save them in a second wave.\nThere’s also been accusations of ideology, callousness, etc. I’m doubtful about those. I imagine both many cock-ups as a complex situation develops, and a genuine philosophical difficulty for those (like Johnson) who believe people do best with less regulation and then must adjust to imposing rules. There’s also a balance to be struck between doing the right thing logically, and being seen to do something. Johnson’s latest approval ratings suggest that he’s succeeded with that, at least!\nLocked down\nMarch 28th. Already semi-retired, and with neither young nor old to care for, I’m fairly used to time in the house, but not to an empty diary: no days at work, Metro rides, evening meetings, and fewer walks, though the beach is wide and sparse. Our street now has a chatty What’sApp group and a red/green flag for windows. More bicycles than cars sometimes too! With relatives and acquaintances seriously ill, we know it’s deadly despite our own comfort.\nTotally unreal!\nMarch 21st: I’ve read some novels about things like ‘after the nuclear holocaust’, plagues, etc, and Wyndham’s stories such as Day of the Triffids and The Chrysalids, and seen films too, such as ‘Children of Men’ (in which children are no longer born for some unknown reason). They were interesting, intriguing, slightly scary. I grew up and became an adult at a time when nuclear war seemed a possibility (though it’s not gone away entirely). One question that was addressed by all of them was how people might behave when scared, stressed, hungry. They usually told of a mixture of noble, communal, self-sacrificing behaviour, and selfish, wild, panicky behaviour. I think we see aspects of this already in this extraordinary crisis.\nI’m an optimist, not always predicting good outcomes, but always believing that good things can happen. Right now, I know there will be many tragedies, many deaths, much unemployment, but still hope that society will prevail, health and well-being restored, the very worst avoided. Might the UK run short of food, even if we’re well-organised in time, if other countries restricted exports because of their own problems? I doubt we’ll get any severe shortage, but we are likely to see local problems, and less choice. I wonder how much we can cut down on food waste, which we’re told is 30% overall. Maybe the law should relax to allow shops to sell goods a little past their dates, but we must also accept more vegetables in imperfect condition, boxes and tins with dents, and throw away very little in our own houses.\nI hope selfishness and panic will very soon be replaced by care, organisation, patience, and that we might see the best in people predominating. My optimism says we will, but my realism also says that there will be problems, profiteering, and lots of worry. I also hope that we might recognise better what’s really important, and that unlimited travel has its drawbacks. Maybe also the greater collective efforts and interventionist government could help us tackle the climate emergency?\nUK policy – seriously wrong, or possibly honest?\nMarch 16th: The quick answer – I don’t know! There are lots of people arguing, and ‘scientists’ are quoted, though many are not epidemiologists. It seems to me that assumptions are being made by all sides. I think the UK policy is roughly this:\n- It’s likely that almost everyone will get this virus sooner or later, within the next year before any reliable vaccine is available. In any case, a vaccine might be only partially effective (like all flu jabs), as the virus could mutate.\n- More testing won’t necessarily achieve anything as such, if 1. is correct.\n- If so, then how can the peak be lowered and timed to allow best management by the NHS? Answer: by accepting a growing number of cases, whilst minimising effects on the most vulnerable.\n- Banning gatherings at an early stage might just postpone the peak, or be unsustainable and make it harder later. Closing schools in particular could lead to a greater shortage of medical and emergency personnel.\n- Things that affect economic activity will have other effects, including poverty and hence other health problems.\nWhat’s wrong with all this? Well, the point about general infection and vaccines might well be true, but time to build up equipment (ventilators) and expertise will reduce deaths. We don’t know to what extent that’s been considered (but a relative of mine in France is getting a novel treatment, so knowledge will increase).\nIf a good vaccine can be developed in a year or so, then maybe stricter restrictions that reduce overall infection rates would be worth the social costs, but we won’t know for months yet. Vaccine development might in any case be slower than this.\nAssumption 1. is key. WHO policy, that many think should be followed here, is based, I think, on the different assumption that overall infection rates can be held at a lower level and the disease eradicated or prevented by vaccination. That was clearly appropriate for Ebola.\nWhere our Government is clearly in the wrong is, firstly, that intensive care beds are at a low level, and there are significant shortages of nurses – they are responsible for that over the past ten years. Brexit policy is likely to make staff shortages much worse. And secondly, they could have ordered more ventilators weeks earlier – that alone might save lives.\nCoronavirus – everyone’s an expert!\nMarch 14th: For once, I think Boris Johnson might be showing some courage. He looks terrible – haggard and short of confidence. For perhaps the first time in his life he’s fully aware of major responsibility, and of decisions on which lives depend and on which he’ll be judged. The Government policy of ramping up more steadily than others has logic, though it’s not up to me (or most of us) to judge if it’s correct. What they have definitely got wrong is to start with a shortage of nurses and beds, and having damaged relationships with other countries. A complete lock-down at an early stage would probably delay the peak more, provided people didn’t tire of restrictions, and that economic hardship didn’t cause death and disease through poverty (as well as absence of medical staff). However, unless an effective vaccine were available within 6-9 months, a second wave of infections next winter, on a much larger scale, could be a disaster.\nBrexit – what a mess!\nMarch 2020: A while since I posted here – so much to think about. Johnson got his majority in December, so he could claim to ‘get Brexit done’, but really only just getting started. I rather hoped his monomaniac approach, including choosing such a loyal if untalented Cabinet, would give way to some realism, but it was not to be. He still has a crazy Cabinet, and an apparent belief that incredibly complex negotiations can be done in a few months. Three possibilities: 1. He’s genuinely OK with the idea of a hard Brexit. 2. He’ll extend the transition after all. 3. He’s going to cave in on most EU requirements. My own view is that ‘no-deal’ is improbable. Why? Because he likes being popular, and medicine shortages and the loss of industries like Nissan would make him very unpopular. I predict a mix of 2 and 3.\nPreserving our beautiful world\n30th December: Listening to Greta Thunberg on the radio – showing how much difference an individual can make. Before that, David Attenborough and Mark Carney, all emphasising the need for urgent action. Individual actions saving energy all make a small contribution but also help to show governments what voters want.\nDisappointment but not despair\nSunday 15th: The bad news – a substantial majority for the Conservatives, gained by constant lying, unrealistic promises, little information about what a Brexit deal might look like, and vague threats against the judiciary, the press, etc. The good news – doubling our vote in both constituencies of North Tyneside and Tynemouth (around 7%). The questions: will Johnson use his majority to ignore the hard right and make a sensible deal? will the Labour Party find a sensible leader and become an effective opposition? will the Lib Dems find a distinctive purpose under a new leader? will the state of Labour and Conservative parties lead to yet more gains for Lib Dems in local elections?",

As new cases and numbers of deaths begin to level out, we hope for a vaccine, that new recognition of who and what is really important will not be lost amidst economic hardship, mental health, suffering in refugee camps. A few weeks more before we have any idea at all …..\nAuthor: johnapplebyld\nOur Community\nApril 3rd: Mounting cases, mounting numbers of deaths, confusion in Government (though with a little welcome honesty yesterday!), but some positives too. Our quiet street is developing a sense of community spirit. A Green/Red flag scheme so people can signal a need is in place, maybe not revealing needs if they are already under control, but showing a keen desire to look after each other. A WhatsApp group to share experiences and wants, whether a birthday, information about mail-order, or a wish for cheese or tofu! A nurse was isolated with her family for a few days, only to find her positive was a false positive and she’s back in the front-line. A seven-year-old’s birthday was marked communally with singing and music, including my own accordion in the street outside and my wife’s violin. We’ve already been booked for the proposed street-party at the end of lock-down.\nWill this community spirit continue when it’s all over? Obviously we don’t know, but at least we know more names and faces. Maybe this time will awaken people to what’s really important in life (beauty and friendship, rather than possessions), to the people they depend on who are often badly-paid and insecure, to the risks of unlimited foreign travel. I hope so.\nGovernment logic and its limitations\nMarch 28th: Our UK Gov’t has been much criticised. My interpretation is this. They believed (probably rightly) that nearly everyone would catch the virus before immunity and/or vaccine took effect. Therefore, it was pointless to try to delay the inevitable, including amongst medical staff, as economic harm would be bad and would also cause deaths. Moreover, the vast majority of deaths would be amongst the elderly, and would be those quite likely to die within the year (noting that the normal death rate in the UK is about 50,000 per month – rarely mentioned).\nWhat this also assumes, I think, is that people simply divide into those that die and those that don’t. What it leaves out is four things. Firstly, a significant minority of those who die might be saved with sufficient care, hence staffing and ventilators etc are needed. Secondly, a delay in the peak gives more time to develop treatments. Thirdly, it’s been said that a higher ‘load’ of the virus not only increases the chance of catching it, but also the severity of the illness – this is pertinent to medical staff and why PPE is important. Lastly, good treatment might make death less painful even where it’s inevitable. It’s also possible that, if many can avoid it altogether this year, a vaccine might save them in a second wave.\nThere’s also been accusations of ideology, callousness, etc. I’m doubtful about those. I imagine both many cock-ups as a complex situation develops, and a genuine philosophical difficulty for those (like Johnson) who believe people do best with less regulation and then must adjust to imposing rules. There’s also a balance to be struck between doing the right thing logically, and being seen to do something. Johnson’s latest approval ratings suggest that he’s succeeded with that, at least!\nLocked down\nMarch 28th. Already semi-retired, and with neither young nor old to care for, I’m fairly used to time in the house, but not to an empty diary: no days at work, Metro rides, evening meetings, and fewer walks, though the beach is wide and sparse. Our street now has a chatty What’sApp group and a red/green flag for windows. More bicycles than cars sometimes too! With relatives and acquaintances seriously ill, we know it’s deadly despite our own comfort.\nTotally unreal!\nMarch 21st: I’ve read some novels about things like ‘after the nuclear holocaust’, plagues, etc, and Wyndham’s stories such as Day of the Triffids and The Chrysalids, and seen films too, such as ‘Children of Men’ (in which children are no longer born for some unknown reason). They were interesting, intriguing, slightly scary. I grew up and became an adult at a time when nuclear war seemed a possibility (though it’s not gone away entirely). One question that was addressed by all of them was how people might behave when scared, stressed, hungry. They usually told of a mixture of noble, communal, self-sacrificing behaviour, and selfish, wild, panicky behaviour. I think we see aspects of this already in this extraordinary crisis.\nI’m an optimist, not always predicting good outcomes, but always believing that good things can happen. Right now, I know there will be many tragedies, many deaths, much unemployment, but still hope that society will prevail, health and well-being restored, the very worst avoided. Might the UK run short of food, even if we’re well-organised in time, if other countries restricted exports because of their own problems? I doubt we’ll get any severe shortage, but we are likely to see local problems, and less choice. I wonder how much we can cut down on food waste, which we’re told is 30% overall. Maybe the law should relax to allow shops to sell goods a little past their dates, but we must also accept more vegetables in imperfect condition, boxes and tins with dents, and throw away very little in our own houses.\nI hope selfishness and panic will very soon be replaced by care, organisation, patience, and that we might see the best in people predominating. My optimism says we will, but my realism also says that there will be problems, profiteering, and lots of worry. I also hope that we might recognise better what’s really important, and that unlimited travel has its drawbacks. Maybe also the greater collective efforts and interventionist government could help us tackle the climate emergency?\nUK policy – seriously wrong, or possibly honest?\nMarch 16th: The quick answer – I don’t know! There are lots of people arguing, and ‘scientists’ are quoted, though many are not epidemiologists. It seems to me that assumptions are being made by all sides. I think the UK policy is roughly this:\n- It’s likely that almost everyone will get this virus sooner or later, within the next year before any reliable vaccine is available. In any case, a vaccine might be only partially effective (like all flu jabs), as the virus could mutate.\n- More testing won’t necessarily achieve anything as such, if 1. is correct.\n- If so, then how can the peak be lowered and timed to allow best management by the NHS? Answer: by accepting a growing number of cases, whilst minimising effects on the most vulnerable.\n- Banning gatherings at an early stage might just postpone the peak, or be unsustainable and make it harder later. Closing schools in particular could lead to a greater shortage of medical and emergency personnel.\n- Things that affect economic activity will have other effects, including poverty and hence other health problems.\nWhat’s wrong with all this? Well, the point about general infection and vaccines might well be true, but time to build up equipment (ventilators) and expertise will reduce deaths. We don’t know to what extent that’s been considered (but a relative of mine in France is getting a novel treatment, so knowledge will increase).\nIf a good vaccine can be developed in a year or so, then maybe stricter restrictions that reduce overall infection rates would be worth the social costs, but we won’t know for months yet. Vaccine development might in any case be slower than this.\nAssumption 1. is key. WHO policy, that many think should be followed here, is based, I think, on the different assumption that overall infection rates can be held at a lower level and the disease eradicated or prevented by vaccination. That was clearly appropriate for Ebola.\nWhere our Government is clearly in the wrong is, firstly, that intensive care beds are at a low level, and there are significant shortages of nurses – they are responsible for that over the past ten years. Brexit policy is likely to make staff shortages much worse. And secondly, they could have ordered more ventilators weeks earlier – that alone might save lives.\nCoronavirus – everyone’s an expert!\nMarch 14th: For once, I think Boris Johnson might be showing some courage. He looks terrible – haggard and short of confidence. For perhaps the first time in his life he’s fully aware of major responsibility, and of decisions on which lives depend and on which he’ll be judged. The Government policy of ramping up more steadily than others has logic, though it’s not up to me (or most of us) to judge if it’s correct. What they have definitely got wrong is to start with a shortage of nurses and beds, and having damaged relationships with other countries. A complete lock-down at an early stage would probably delay the peak more, provided people didn’t tire of restrictions, and that economic hardship didn’t cause death and disease through poverty (as well as absence of medical staff). However, unless an effective vaccine were available within 6-9 months, a second wave of infections next winter, on a much larger scale, could be a disaster.\nBrexit – what a mess!\nMarch 2020: A while since I posted here – so much to think about. Johnson got his majority in December, so he could claim to ‘get Brexit done’, but really only just getting started. I rather hoped his monomaniac approach, including choosing such a loyal if untalented Cabinet, would give way to some realism, but it was not to be. He still has a crazy Cabinet, and an apparent belief that incredibly complex negotiations can be done in a few months. Three possibilities: 1. He’s genuinely OK with the idea of a hard Brexit. 2. He’ll extend the transition after all. 3. He’s going to cave in on most EU requirements. My own view is that ‘no-deal’ is improbable. Why? Because he likes being popular, and medicine shortages and the loss of industries like Nissan would make him very unpopular. I predict a mix of 2 and 3.\nPreserving our beautiful world\n30th December: Listening to Greta Thunberg on the radio – showing how much difference an individual can make. Before that, David Attenborough and Mark Carney, all emphasising the need for urgent action. Individual actions saving energy all make a small contribution but also help to show governments what voters want.\nDisappointment but not despair\nSunday 15th: The bad news – a substantial majority for the Conservatives, gained by constant lying, unrealistic promises, little information about what a Brexit deal might look like, and vague threats against the judiciary, the press, etc. The good news – doubling our vote in both constituencies of North Tyneside and Tynemouth (around 7%). The questions: will Johnson use his majority to ignore the hard right and make a sensible deal? will the Labour Party find a sensible leader and become an effective opposition? will the Lib Dems find a distinctive purpose under a new leader? will the state of Labour and Conservative parties lead to yet more gains for Lib Dems in local elections?",

Local Lib Dem councillors suffered badly in the period c.2013-2017 or so. And this time, not only were Conservatives not credible, but Labour managed to skip their ‘honeymoon period’ in government too, creating an impression of an uncaring regime in their determination to be seen as financially prudent.\nIt was a good day for the Lib Dems, with over 300 councillors gained, and control of three councils – Cambridge, Oxford and Shropshire.\nWhat about Reform? They are cock-a-hoop with over 600 councillors and 10 councils. But any talk of future government is highly questionable. They appear to have no real policies, a leader who hates sharing power (members get no say on policy), and minimal experience in local government. One successful candidate talked of ‘waste’ but could only think of biscuits in council meetings. It’s highly probable that within a year they’ll find they can’t do very much, especially when funding is so tight, and that waste is not only less than they think but is very hard to reduce.\nThe local Elected Mayor contest in North Tyneside led to a Labour Mayor again, but by a small margin of 444 votes. I did a little better than last time, but hoped for more. Here’s the results:",

I also stressed my own priority of the Environment, as well as the party’s headlines on care, social care and the NHS, and on Europe and internationalism.\nOur questions were on: Active Travel, Palestine, Housing, Europe, and on voting systems.

The Taliban, it seems, brought order and a familiar culture to the outlying regions when the government was seen as remote and hostile.\nIt’s tragic too that at a time of increasing nationalism elsewhere, the UK government has become less friendly and trusting, but also weakened severely those cultural influences that have given us ‘soft power’ and perhaps helped to encourage a more inclusive, honest and forward-looking style of government across many countries.

Perhaps concentrating on female education and participation in sport and culture would have created less of a conservative backlash than what was seen as an imposition of leadership. Of course a fully-inclusive society was a fine ideal, but evidently the culture change expected in less than one generation, and the tribalism and corruption of a centralised and non-credible government, was too much. The Taliban, it seems, brought order and a familiar culture to the outlying regions when the government was seen as remote and hostile.\nIt’s tragic too that at a time of increasing nationalism elsewhere, the UK government has become less friendly and trusting, but also weakened severely those cultural influences that have given us ‘soft power’ and perhaps helped to encourage a more inclusive, honest and forward-looking style of government across many countries. That is, many world leaders (one in seven?) are British educated. Our Civil Service has been respected for professionalism and independence. The BBC is the most trusted international news source. Our governance has been seen as mature, rational, patient and honest. All this seems under threat. Very worrying.",

Local Lib Dem councillors suffered badly in the period c.2013-2017 or so. And this time, not only were Conservatives not credible, but Labour managed to skip their ‘honeymoon period’ in government too, creating an impression of an uncaring regime in their determination to be seen as financially prudent.\nIt was a good day for the Lib Dems, with over 300 councillors gained, and control of three councils – Cambridge, Oxford and Shropshire.\nWhat about Reform? They are cock-a-hoop with over 600 councillors and 10 councils. But any talk of future government is highly questionable. They appear to have no real policies, a leader who hates sharing power (members get no say on policy), and minimal experience in local government. One successful candidate talked of ‘waste’ but could only think of biscuits in council meetings. It’s highly probable that within a year they’ll find they can’t do very much, especially when funding is so tight, and that waste is not only less than they think but is very hard to reduce.\nThe local Elected Mayor contest in North Tyneside led to a Labour Mayor again, but by a small margin of 444 votes. I did a little better than last time, but hoped for more. Here’s the results:",

Lots of good debates about well thought-out policy (mostly) and today the Leader’s speech. But will anyone take any notice?\nThe Liberal Democrats see themselves as a national party – rightly so in that they have many councillors in all areas, and usually get a credible share of the vote in seats where they already have a base and work hard. For a while, they had a substantial number of MPs – over 40 in 1997, rising to over 50 in 2010, though currently languishing just into double figures. They also have around 100 peers, and much of the impact of the party is in contributions to committee work and amendments in the House of Lords.\nThe problem is, though, that the public don’t really know what the Lib Dems stand for, in simple terms. Most people would say that the Conservatives (long-term, not true just now, though!) favour individual responsibility, free enterprise, sound finance, strong defence, traditional family values. Similarly, they’d say Labour favoured the NHS, the poor, fairness and equality.\nWhat might they say about the Lib Dems? Europe. Student fees. Middle-ground. Not quite Tories nor Socialists. ……… One positive, one negative, the rest rather vague! As a party, they have a wide range of sound and interesting policy, but have trouble getting coverage for that, more so with fewer MPs. It could be argued that not being a party of sound-bites is not all bad, and that the specifics can cut through in individual elections, notably Chesham & Amersham recently.\nHowever, in General Elections, that’s not ideal, especially with our First-Past-The-Post system. There’s much could be said about voting systems, but it’s a mistake to think that PR will solve all our problems, and I think we must be cautious in thinking that public support for statements like ‘every vote counts’, ‘get parties to collaborate more’ would necessarily translate into electoral success (‘I don’t really understand this’, ‘They want it just to suit themselves’, ‘But it might let in extremists’, ….). My experience of the Supplementary Vote system (used for Mayoral elections) is that people still put the Lib Dems second to avoid ‘letting Lab/Con in’, not realising that votes transfer, and unfortunately even obscuring the number of second choices we get (except in London, where they count and publish those too).\nAlthough it’s sensible (aren’t they always?) to avoid alienating voters when trying to win votes from both sides, there is a danger of being just ‘not them, but not the others either’. I do think we need one or two distinctive, desirable, memorable messages that, vitally, the public associates with the Liberal Democrats.\nWell, today Ed Davey set out his two main messages: Firstly, looking after our carers, at home and professional – the huge army of people who support our children, our elderly, our disabled and our sick. Secondly, a voucher for £200 for families to help their children catch up with missed education or missed opportunities during the pandemic. Families would be able to spend that on formal teaching, other classes or tutors, or activities. These two principal proposals would make a massive difference to many thousands of families struggling with current burdens and unable to profit from future opportunities.\nThe public care about carers, they care about their children – will these key ideas be memorable and striking? Time will tell!",

Most people would say that the Conservatives (long-term, not true just now, though!) favour individual responsibility, free enterprise, sound finance, strong defence, traditional family values. Similarly, they’d say Labour favoured the NHS, the poor, fairness and equality.\nWhat might they say about the Lib Dems? Europe. Student fees. Middle-ground. Not quite Tories nor Socialists. ……… One positive, one negative, the rest rather vague! As a party, they have a wide range of sound and interesting policy, but have trouble getting coverage for that, more so with fewer MPs. It could be argued that not being a party of sound-bites is not all bad, and that the specifics can cut through in individual elections, notably Chesham & Amersham recently.\nHowever, in General Elections, that’s not ideal, especially with our First-Past-The-Post system. There’s much could be said about voting systems, but it’s a mistake to think that PR will solve all our problems, and I think we must be cautious in thinking that public support for statements like ‘every vote counts’, ‘get parties to collaborate more’ would necessarily translate into electoral success (‘I don’t really understand this’, ‘They want it just to suit themselves’, ‘But it might let in extremists’, ….). My experience of the Supplementary Vote system (used for Mayoral elections) is that people still put the Lib Dems second to avoid ‘letting Lab/Con in’, not realising that votes transfer, and unfortunately even obscuring the number of second choices we get (except in London, where they count and publish those too).\nAlthough it’s sensible (aren’t they always?) to avoid alienating voters when trying to win votes from both sides, there is a danger of being just ‘not them, but not the others either’. I do think we need one or two distinctive, desirable, memorable messages that, vitally, the public associates with the Liberal Democrats.\nWell, today Ed Davey set out his two main messages: Firstly, looking after our carers, at home and professional – the huge army of people who support our children, our elderly, our disabled and our sick. Secondly, a voucher for £200 for families to help their children catch up with missed education or missed opportunities during the pandemic. Families would be able to spend that on formal teaching, other classes or tutors, or activities. These two principal proposals would make a massive difference to many thousands of families struggling with current burdens and unable to profit from future opportunities.\nThe public care about carers, they care about their children – will these key ideas be memorable and striking? Time will tell!",

A few weeks more before we have any idea at all …..\nJohn’s blog on current issues\nOur Community\nApril 3rd: Mounting cases, mounting numbers of deaths, confusion in Government (though with a little welcome honesty yesterday!), but some positives too. Our quiet street is developing a sense of community spirit. A Green/Red flag scheme so people can signal a need is in place, maybe not revealing needs if they are already under control, but showing a keen desire to look after each other. A WhatsApp group to share experiences and wants, whether a birthday, information about mail-order, or a wish for cheese or tofu! A nurse was isolated with her family for a few days, only to find her positive was a false positive and she’s back in the front-line. A seven-year-old’s birthday was marked communally with singing and music, including my own accordion in the street outside and my wife’s violin. We’ve already been booked for the proposed street-party at the end of lock-down.\nWill this community spirit continue when it’s all over? Obviously we don’t know, but at least we know more names and faces. Maybe this time will awaken people to what’s really important in life (beauty and friendship, rather than possessions), to the people they depend on who are often badly-paid and insecure, to the risks of unlimited foreign travel. I hope so.\nGovernment logic and its limitations\nMarch 28th: Our UK Gov’t has been much criticised. My interpretation is this. They believed (probably rightly) that nearly everyone would catch the virus before immunity and/or vaccine took effect. Therefore, it was pointless to try to delay the inevitable, including amongst medical staff, as economic harm would be bad and would also cause deaths. Moreover, the vast majority of deaths would be amongst the elderly, and would be those quite likely to die within the year (noting that the normal death rate in the UK is about 50,000 per month – rarely mentioned).\nWhat this also assumes, I think, is that people simply divide into those that die and those that don’t. What it leaves out is four things. Firstly, a significant minority of those who die might be saved with sufficient care, hence staffing and ventilators etc are needed. Secondly, a delay in the peak gives more time to develop treatments. Thirdly, it’s been said that a higher ‘load’ of the virus not only increases the chance of catching it, but also the severity of the illness – this is pertinent to medical staff and why PPE is important. Lastly, good treatment might make death less painful even where it’s inevitable. It’s also possible that, if many can avoid it altogether this year, a vaccine might save them in a second wave.\nThere’s also been accusations of ideology, callousness, etc. I’m doubtful about those. I imagine both many cock-ups as a complex situation develops, and a genuine philosophical difficulty for those (like Johnson) who believe people do best with less regulation and then must adjust to imposing rules. There’s also a balance to be struck between doing the right thing logically, and being seen to do something. Johnson’s latest approval ratings suggest that he’s succeeded with that, at least!\nLocked down\nMarch 28th. Already semi-retired, and with neither young nor old to care for, I’m fairly used to time in the house, but not to an empty diary: no days at work, Metro rides, evening meetings, and fewer walks, though the beach is wide and sparse. Our street now has a chatty What’sApp group and a red/green flag for windows. More bicycles than cars sometimes too! With relatives and acquaintances seriously ill, we know it’s deadly despite our own comfort.\nTotally unreal!\nMarch 21st: I’ve read some novels about things like ‘after the nuclear holocaust’, plagues, etc, and Wyndham’s stories such as Day of the Triffids and The Chrysalids, and seen films too, such as ‘Children of Men’ (in which children are no longer born for some unknown reason). They were interesting, intriguing, slightly scary. I grew up and became an adult at a time when nuclear war seemed a possibility (though it’s not gone away entirely). One question that was addressed by all of them was how people might behave when scared, stressed, hungry. They usually told of a mixture of noble, communal, self-sacrificing behaviour, and selfish, wild, panicky behaviour. I think we see aspects of this already in this extraordinary crisis.\nI’m an optimist, not always predicting good outcomes, but always believing that good things can happen. Right now, I know there will be many tragedies, many deaths, much unemployment, but still hope that society will prevail, health and well-being restored, the very worst avoided. Might the UK run short of food, even if we’re well-organised in time, if other countries restricted exports because of their own problems? I doubt we’ll get any severe shortage, but we are likely to see local problems, and less choice. I wonder how much we can cut down on food waste, which we’re told is 30% overall. Maybe the law should relax to allow shops to sell goods a little past their dates, but we must also accept more vegetables in imperfect condition, boxes and tins with dents, and throw away very little in our own houses.\nI hope selfishness and panic will very soon be replaced by care, organisation, patience, and that we might see the best in people predominating. My optimism says we will, but my realism also says that there will be problems, profiteering, and lots of worry. I also hope that we might recognise better what’s really important, and that unlimited travel has its drawbacks. Maybe also the greater collective efforts and interventionist government could help us tackle the climate emergency?\nUK policy – seriously wrong, or possibly honest?\nMarch 16th: The quick answer – I don’t know! There are lots of people arguing, and ‘scientists’ are quoted, though many are not epidemiologists. It seems to me that assumptions are being made by all sides. I think the UK policy is roughly this:\n- It’s likely that almost everyone will get this virus sooner or later, within the next year before any reliable vaccine is available. In any case, a vaccine might be only partially effective (like all flu jabs), as the virus could mutate.\n- More testing won’t necessarily achieve anything as such, if 1. is correct.\n- If so, then how can the peak be lowered and timed to allow best management by the NHS? Answer: by accepting a growing number of cases, whilst minimising effects on the most vulnerable.\n- Banning gatherings at an early stage might just postpone the peak, or be unsustainable and make it harder later. Closing schools in particular could lead to a greater shortage of medical and emergency personnel.\n- Things that affect economic activity will have other effects, including poverty and hence other health problems.\nWhat’s wrong with all this? Well, the point about general infection and vaccines might well be true, but time to build up equipment (ventilators) and expertise will reduce deaths. We don’t know to what extent that’s been considered (but a relative of mine in France is getting a novel treatment, so knowledge will increase).\nIf a good vaccine can be developed in a year or so, then maybe stricter restrictions that reduce overall infection rates would be worth the social costs, but we won’t know for months yet. Vaccine development might in any case be slower than this.\nAssumption 1. is key. WHO policy, that many think should be followed here, is based, I think, on the different assumption that overall infection rates can be held at a lower level and the disease eradicated or prevented by vaccination. That was clearly appropriate for Ebola.\nWhere our Government is clearly in the wrong is, firstly, that intensive care beds are at a low level, and there are significant shortages of nurses – they are responsible for that over the past ten years. Brexit policy is likely to make staff shortages much worse. And secondly, they could have ordered more ventilators weeks earlier – that alone might save lives.\nCoronavirus – everyone’s an expert!\nMarch 14th: For once, I think Boris Johnson might be showing some courage. He looks terrible – haggard and short of confidence. For perhaps the first time in his life he’s fully aware of major responsibility, and of decisions on which lives depend and on which he’ll be judged. The Government policy of ramping up more steadily than others has logic, though it’s not up to me (or most of us) to judge if it’s correct. What they have definitely got wrong is to start with a shortage of nurses and beds, and having damaged relationships with other countries. A complete lock-down at an early stage would probably delay the peak more, provided people didn’t tire of restrictions, and that economic hardship didn’t cause death and disease through poverty (as well as absence of medical staff). However, unless an effective vaccine were available within 6-9 months, a second wave of infections next winter, on a much larger scale, could be a disaster.\nBrexit – what a mess!\nMarch 2020: A while since I posted here – so much to think about. Johnson got his majority in December, so he could claim to ‘get Brexit done’, but really only just getting started. I rather hoped his monomaniac approach, including choosing such a loyal if untalented Cabinet, would give way to some realism, but it was not to be. He still has a crazy Cabinet, and an apparent belief that incredibly complex negotiations can be done in a few months. Three possibilities: 1. He’s genuinely OK with the idea of a hard Brexit. 2. He’ll extend the transition after all. 3. He’s going to cave in on most EU requirements. My own view is that ‘no-deal’ is improbable. Why? Because he likes being popular, and medicine shortages and the loss of industries like Nissan would make him very unpopular. I predict a mix of 2 and 3.\nPreserving our beautiful world\n30th December: Listening to Greta Thunberg on the radio – showing how much difference an individual can make. Before that, David Attenborough and Mark Carney, all emphasising the need for urgent action. Individual actions saving energy all make a small contribution but also help to show governments what voters want.\nDisappointment but not despair\nSunday 15th: The bad news – a substantial majority for the Conservatives, gained by constant lying, unrealistic promises, little information about what a Brexit deal might look like, and vague threats against the judiciary, the press, etc. The good news – doubling our vote in both constituencies of North Tyneside and Tynemouth (around 7%). The questions: will Johnson use his majority to ignore the hard right and make a sensible deal? will the Labour Party find a sensible leader and become an effective opposition? will the Lib Dems find a distinctive purpose under a new leader? will the state of Labour and Conservative parties lead to yet more gains for Lib Dems in local elections?",

I used to see them every day from April to October when I lived in Fenham and walked to Newcastle University each day.\nCategory: Uncategorized\nNew life at Easter\nApril 21st – Easter Sunday: Greeting the dawn at 5.45am on the sea-front at Whitley Bay with forty people from local churches. A wonderful, beautiful clear morning with hope for new life. Good words on the radio too about how new energy and hope can rise from disaster, such as the fire at Notre Dame, and how similar that story is to the fire at Brancepeth Church in County Durham in 1997. Both seemed to resonate with people of faith and none – a sense of shared history and mystery about these ancient buildings.\nCentre for Cities hustings\nApril 18th: At a hustings organised by the Centre for Cities and the NE Chamber of Commerce, where all five candidates answered questions on the economy, transport, etc. Some good questions: ‘Why would an entrepreneur choose Newcastle?’, ‘How do we make the local economy more inclusive?’ (this meant including those from different socio-economic backgrounds), ‘What would you do for business in Newcastle City Centre?’.\nThe whole 90 minute session was filmed by Hexham TV (a web-based community station – also see March 6th) and can be seen at: https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=2439405909629159&_rdr\n(Also note that my interview with Sustrans is available as three items on my Twitter posts.)\nLook at the interviewer, not the camera\nApril 18th: A busy day yesterday, starting with filming by ITV on Blyth dockside for the evening programmes on Thursday 25th. It felt like one of those adverts, sitting at a table in the open air with cranes, goods and the sea behind. Seven questions about me, my aims and policy, and my local knowledge (and I got the local celebrity right!).\nLater that morning, an important session with ‘Becoming Visible’ – working with deaf people on materials, education and advice for employment. They filmed me answering questions and will add sign language later so that the deaf community can get information accessibly. We discussed difficulties of funding, of delayed education, and the need for employers to see disabled people as an underused resource rather than a problem to be solved.\nMy Sustrans interview (see previous blog item) was then followed by a personal profile by an Evening Chronicle reporter. I declined to say who my second vote would be cast for, and explained that I was offering myself and my experience for a job that needs to be done well – this is not a personal ambition – and that linked to my personal faith.\nGetting around\nApril 17th: Meetings concerning transport and logistics in the area, with Directors of the North East Joint Transport Committee, the CEO of the Port of Tyne Authority, and senior staff of Sustrans, the cycling organisation.\nTransport is a crucial aspect of the functioning and prosperity of the North of Tyne area and the whole region, but unlike the other ‘Metro Mayors’, our new Mayor won’t have direct control owing to the overlapping responsibilities of the various authorities.\nI heard lots about strategic plans, the need for Government as well as regional investment, and challenged them on how new environmental targets would affect their plans. Sustrans will advise on more than cycling; they’ll help find solutions for Active Living in cities, including public transport, walking and cycling.\nNewcastle Airport is run separately, and well, but a low carbon strategy for the area can’t simply assume growth in all aspects of transport. David Attenborough, and the recent ‘Extinction Rebellion’ protests are highlighting this, and this letter was in yesterday’s Metro – the public are taking this seriously now!\nA short break\nApril 10th: I love the British countryside, and the North of Tyne area has a lot of it (some of that actually South of the Tyne!). Although this break was in the Lake District, both areas share beauty, many small communities, and many, many sheep! Returning over the Pennines via Alston, I noticed the border from Cumbria back into Northumberland with new eyes!\nFlights of fancy\n4th March: A useful discussion with the Chief Executive and Planning & Corporate Affairs Director of Newcastle Airport about their plans for visitors, tourism, business, and the challenges of balancing prosperity for the region with the growing environmental threat. Today they’re releasing a new website for tourism across the North-East on behalf of their seven local authority partners and other agencies: http://visitnortheastengland.com/\nAfter that, an interview and photo-shoot, plus short video, with NETimes – a digital magazine for business in the North-East. https://netimesmagazine.co.uk/times-live/the-future-of-the-north-of-tyne/ /\nOpen for Business\n3rd March: A demanding two hours on the platform at a Business Hustings organised by the CBI, NE Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses, Entrepreneurs Forum for all four declared candidates (nb. a fifth declared that afternoon). We had a chance to set out our vision and approach, our values, and specific policies for business, including human issues of equality, poverty, education, etc. Lots of questions from the floor and submitted electronically. Around 150 people there, including media, with good write-ups in the Journal at https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/north-tyne-mayor-should-buy-16072217?utm_source=sharebar&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sharebar and by the Knowledge Development Manager of NE Chamberon on Twitter: @NEEChamberArlen . Also see @CBINorth for this video clip summarising my approach to Business.\nEnvironment and Rural Affairs\nApril 1st: Lots of good humour, but mostly serious stuff! At an excellent seminar led by Lord Donald Curry, Northumberland farmer and House of Lords cross-bencher, a key voice in the drafting of the Agriculture bill – possibly the most significant changes to support structures and funding since 1947. As Brexit has delayed progress, there is an unforeseen benefit that we were not too late to contribute ideas and priorities to the process, and he welcomed this. We talked also about the sustainability of rural communities, where often the local church is the only remaining public building and focus for communal life.\nGiving people a voice\nMarch 27th: I spent an hour with representatives of Tyne & Wear Citizens – involving people in social and political change who have felt ignored in the past. Good to hear their stories about why they’re involved, and telling mine too (early days of the People’s Kitchen, living on an estate). Would I, as Mayor, support their campaigns on the Living Wage, Mental Health, Islamophobia, Free School Meals funds? Yes, I would, but we discussed some practical implications, how much influence the Mayor might have, and questions of how quickly things could move.\nOn April 30th all the candidates will face similar questions in front of an Assembly of 1,200 – wow!",

As many said, Keir Starmer was aiming at an open goal, and scored repeatedly. Few Conservatives supported the PM at all; just a few asked boilerplate, irrelevant questions to try to take the heat off their ‘winning’ leader.\nIn 2019, many Conservative MPs, most Conservative members, and then sufficient voters, thought that Johnson, for all his known faults, would do a good enough job as PM, getting the country out of the endless, boring, Brexit debate (some Remainers thought this too), and there would be enough checks and balances to keep him from doing too much harm. As with Trump in the US, that was hopelessly optimistic. Brexit is an ongoing open sore, and Johnson gets worse, not better.\nBefore all the stuff about parties, and wallpaper, and dodgy dealings of all kinds, I often said that my chief regrets about the past six years were the lying, the disregard of courtesy and convention, the undermining or actual attacks on our highly-prized institutions (Rule of Law, human rights, the BBC, universities, animal welfare, the Civil Service, honesty in treaties and diplomacy, democracy, …….), and the shredding of our international reputation. These bothered me more than loss of freedom of movement or economic harm, important though those were.\nIs Johnson finished? I don’t know – in the next week or so many Conservative MPs will find out if their constituents get more and more angry, or simmer down. What that party (or the Conservative Work-Event, as I call it now!) won’t want is a leadership election during March and April, with local elections coming up. They’ll either act very soon, or wait until the Summer.\nIf the former, then it’s likely Sunak will be the next PM. Apart from confidence and presentation, we know nothing about his abilities, and his experience is of privilege. He’d at least be able to stay in the same flat at number 10 if he wanted! But there are other Conservatives with more experience who’d stand more chance of tackling the crises of the pandemic, the economy, cost-of-living, etc.",

They say things like: ‘There’s no-one arguing for EU membership, even though a clear majority now believe that leaving was a mistake, and have a favourable view of the EU!’ Starmer seems to be taking a similar line to Davey, though it’s well-known that he wanted to Remain. So why are they silent on this?\nLast year, although most Labour supporters, and nearly all Lib Dem supporters, wanted to Remain, once Johnson got his majority, there was no stopping him (and it’s worth remembering that the General Election was called because the PM controlled HoC business and had withdrawn the Withdrawal Agreement, making ‘no-deal’ the default), so in 2020 the debate changed. I think both Davey and Starmer calculated that Johnson could be relied on to mess things up, and their job was to help that along, with the expectation that he’d look more and more ridiculous and dishonest. Avoiding giving him ammunition was Starmer’s idea, I think – let him stew in his own juice!\nAs well as avoiding the ‘it’s all the fault of Remoaners!’ tag, another key aim was to get the press turning against the Government – something that’s now happening. That works provided the Opposition doesn’t offer too many easy attack lines.\nFinally, we all hope that Johnson (who isn’t actually insane, completely stupid, and is probably well-advised usually) will agree some kind of deal with the EU at the last moment. As this will be a massive U-turn, and he’ll try to present that to his own party as a victory, the worst thing to do right now is to make that harder for him, almost to force him to stick to his own bad script. And what strengthens my conviction is that he is doing things to appease his right-wing (defence increases, public-sector pay freeze) that will make his U-turn less offensive to them. Much as we might despise the man, for dishonesty, selfishness, laziness, etc, surely we want him to concede what’s needed to the EU to avoid food shortages, closure of industry, the death of farming, and a general huge hit to the economy.\nHe’s painted himself into a corner. We might be gleeful about that, but it’s much more important just now to allow him to jump out of it. There’ll still be the pandemic, and a major shock to the economy, and I think both Davey and Starmer will pivot quite rapidly to being more ‘I told you so’ and pro-EU once the public can see the horrible mess Johnson and his shower have got us into.",

Well, the Labour candidate won, as expected, but by a vastly reduced margin compared with previous years. On a low turnout of only 34%, Karen Clark was elected on 30% of the vote, and by a margin of 444 votes ahead of Reform. I did slightly better than last time, with 6.4% (about 1% up). Here’s the full list:\nThe Chronicle finally published their podcast of the hustings, but only a couple of days before Election Day (delayed by staff absence, I think), so few will have listened. Here it is for anyone still interested (in my bits or anyone else’s). (Note, it didn’t always run successfully for me, maybe depending on internet traffic on the service I use.)\nFrom before Election Day:\nIn 2025, North Tyneside has an election for the Elected Mayor, which happens every four years. Because we have chosen this system, instead of the usual Leader of Council (elected from the leading party), we don’t have a Lord Mayor – we call this honorary position the ‘Chair of Council’.\nNorma Redfearn (Labour) has been Mayor for three four-year terms, twelve years in all, but is standing down this year after her lengthy commitment. I think it’s time for a change, not to assume that Labour will always win every significant post in this region (including North-East Mayor and Police & Crime Commissioner). Having a virtual ‘one-party state’ in this area means, inevitably, that too many decisions are made in a close-knit group, without sufficient challenge and scrutiny to ensure the best results for North Tyneside and the best value-for-money.\nHere’s my statement about my experience and my priorities for this important role:\nThe official booklet, containing statements from all the Mayoral candidates, includes statements from all seven candidates, and will go to every household in North Tyneside. Here’s my entry:\nI was interviewed by the BBC, and this was shown on Sunday 30th in the Politics NE & Cumbria programme. We each got about 15 seconds coverage. My bit was at 20.05 minutes into the programme: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0029mbf/politics-north-north-east-and-cumbria-30032025 . The same clip was shown on ‘Look North’ on Tuesday 1st April, but that is no longer available.\nThere’ll also be a recorded hustings on April 15th, and made available soon afterwards, organised by Newcastle Chronicle. That’s been written up – see: https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/northtyneside-mayoral-elections-hustings-31431618 but the audio version should be available soon (I’ve just been informed that this should be posted but has been delayed).\nI’ll be continuing to post comments and views (including on national issues) in my blog. Much of what I posted in my campaign to be North of Tyne Mayor still applies – see https://johnapplebyld.wordpress.com/mayoral/policy-summary/.\nWatch this Liberal Democrat Party Election broadcast to see our Leader – Sir Ed Davey – explain how Lib Dem policies and values are best for the UK:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaDd4AXDOmI\nMy past responses to campaigning groups and some other specific policies are on this page: https://johnapplebyld.wordpress.com/mayoral-election-2021-specific-policies/",

That was the obvious five parties, plus two independents. Questions came from Chronicle readers, plus a small crowd of invited visitors from Citizens T&W in the recording ‘studio’. We had up to one minute for an opening ‘pitch’, then up to one minute for each answer. Two good questions came from sixth-formers, on crumbling school buildings and on mental health.\nI emphasised my pragmatism, my focus on creating a good environment for pleasure, health and the planet, and the need to consult people fully and properly.\nThere were some good ideas from other candidates, but also a lack of realism in opposing the closure of a loss-making school. I pointed out that the Conservatives academy scheme had taken away from local authorities the power to plan for school capacity. Some candidates advocated ‘savings’ (= cuts) without saying where – it’s easy to talk of inefficiencies without being able to deliver them.\nWith the Greens and one Independent, I favoured cross-party working. On the housing shortage, most of us agreed on the need for more social housing, and on my observation that ‘affordable housing’ meant nothing of the sort. I recommended appointing more inspectors of housing conditions, and said that the Grenfell disaster was partly a consequence of a shortage of fire inspectors and experts.\nThe hustings has been written up – see: https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/northtyneside-mayoral-elections-hustings-31431618\nAn audio form should be available shortly.

I worked both alongside and below managers who sometimes had lots of Vision but less of these aspects. It’s not much use dealing with complexity by ignoring things, making over-hasty decisions, or delegating to the extent of abdicating responsibility.\nBoth Conservative and Labour parties have in recent years chosen ‘leaders’ who were seen by members as strong on a kind of vision, but in Johnson’s case that was mostly a few simple slogans, and in Corbyn’s case a set of values that didn’t chime with the public. For both, there was little credibility, lots of naivety, but the disconnect was evidently worse in Corbyn’s case.\nNow things are changing.

That might be true in the short-term, but would it last. Once the hard questions start coming in, would she stand up to that level of scrutiny? Would the press and public see her as a solid, competent, leader of a national party? Well, maybe, maybe not.

Three of our candidates are enthusiastic young first-time candidates: Daniel, Nathan and Jed. They’d bring a breath of fresh air and not be satisfied with ‘staying calm and carrying on’ – we need to do better than that!\nIn Weetslade ward, campaigner and candidate Daniel Elsom is advocating Community Skips to allow residents to deposit major items for disposal and recycling, as the North Tyneside dump is far away, and current rules do not allow residents to use the much closer Newcastle Brunswick facility (obvious scope for co-operation here!).

If you genuinely believe that the opposing party would be a disaster for the country, then defending your own party is, in that mentality, working for the country. In normal times, the opposing party would not be a disaster and MPs and ministers should maintain truth and principled actions as far as possible, and resign if they can’t.

Thus they thought they’d not only get as good a result, but also demonstrate the ‘go-it-alone’ Brexit value.\nI’ve met many politicians, at all levels, and been involved myself, as well as experience of senior management, decision-making, and, indeed, ‘news management’. My clear impression is that outright lying is not common in the UK, but wishful thinking is very common, both in campaigning (where the public want quick and simple solutions!) and in defending one’s record.\nThis also comes into play when people complain that politicians put ‘party before country’. If you genuinely believe that the opposing party would be a disaster for the country, then defending your own party is, in that mentality, working for the country. In normal times, the opposing party would not be a disaster and MPs and ministers should maintain truth and principled actions as far as possible, and resign if they can’t. In the last General Election, I suspect that many mostly decent Conservative MPs genuinely thought that a Corbyn led government would be disastrous (and maybe that going back on Brexit might be too), hence their unstinting support for a most unsuitable, but confident and charismatic leader. With Keir Starmer as Leader of the Opposition, that no longer applies. Principled Conservatives should not fear loss of power, and they could actually be more free to criticise their own side!\nI don’t understand why the government has got into such a mess about this. They should have put together a team of expert procurement people and asked them to get on with it. They are scoring own goals by taking responsibility fro things they have no expertise in.\nLikeLike\nAgreed. I’ll say more about procurement next.\nLikeLike",
  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_2022_02_08_dogma-days/content_39.html": "February 8th: I decided some years ago that I hate dogma. That’s not a particular dogma, just all of it! There might be a very few exceptions, but these would be a few ‘truths’ for me, such as statements about the importance of truth itself, honesty, the value of human beings, the need to look after the world for the sake of our children and grandchildren, etc.\nDogma means (to me) an explicit statement of a belief that the holder is unwilling to question. I have no objection to strong beliefs, strongly argued, it’s the closed-mindedness that’s the problem, the ‘black-and-white’ view of the subject or the world. Just now, it’s party politics that’s at the forefront of my mind, but I will mention one other area.\nBoris Johnson shouldn’t be Prime Minister. Increasingly, that’s a view held by many Conservative voters and MPs, as well as almost all others. It’s commonly said that by continuing to support him in post, those people are ‘putting party before country’, or ‘putting their own careers before principles’. I don’t think it’s so simple, though I’m not excusing it. It’s clear to me that for many of these MPs (and voters), there is a strong conviction that a Conservative government is best for the country, certainly in the longer-term and probably in the medium-term too. That is, even with doubts and problems at present, they continue to think that a Labour government will be worse for the country overall than almost any conceivable government by ‘their’ party. In this sense, they might believe they are putting country before anything else. Of course, an element of personal career is relevant, but the argument extends easily to: ‘I’ll be a better MP for my constituency than my opponent, because of my core values.’\nWhilst I understand this mentality up to a point, it’s dangerous, as it can lead incrementally to acceptance, even advocacy, of bad policy, bad behaviour, bad management, etc. Surely most Conservative MPs would not have supported Johnson so willingly in 2019 if they’d known in advance how he might behave, how little he valued them, their opinions, their values.\nA dogmatic position that says, in effect: any Conservative government, however bad, is always better than any Labour government, however good, is not a rational position, it’s a black-and-white dogma and should be called out and given no power. Of course, the same would be true for the converse.\nHere’s my other example: When I was young, homosexuality was unknown, then weird, then a joke, then strange, then gradually more a fact of life. However, until I was about 25-30, I wasn’t wholly comfortable with this, whilst trying hard to be accepting. What finally brought me ‘off the fence’ was this: To hold the traditional view (of heterosexual lifelong marriage) was, in effect, to judge that any traditional marriage relationship, however bad, was automatically better than any other form of relationship, however good. That is, a dogmatic traditional position was clearly wrong and untenable for me. Thereafter, I accepted the validity and value of all good, committed, respectful relationships, hetero- or homo-sexual, whilst still rejecting any relationship that didn’t meet those values, or didn’t try hard to. I could add other rejected dogmas to these two, but that’s enough for today!",

For us, ‘joining in’ with many thousands on-line to celebrate and look forward, but so different from normal. As new cases and numbers of deaths begin to level out, we hope for a vaccine, that new recognition of who and what is really important will not be lost amidst economic hardship, mental health, suffering in refugee camps. A few weeks more before we have any idea at all …..\nCategory: Uncategorized\nOur Community\nApril 3rd: Mounting cases, mounting numbers of deaths, confusion in Government (though with a little welcome honesty yesterday!), but some positives too. Our quiet street is developing a sense of community spirit. A Green/Red flag scheme so people can signal a need is in place, maybe not revealing needs if they are already under control, but showing a keen desire to look after each other. A WhatsApp group to share experiences and wants, whether a birthday, information about mail-order, or a wish for cheese or tofu! A nurse was isolated with her family for a few days, only to find her positive was a false positive and she’s back in the front-line. A seven-year-old’s birthday was marked communally with singing and music, including my own accordion in the street outside and my wife’s violin. We’ve already been booked for the proposed street-party at the end of lock-down.\nWill this community spirit continue when it’s all over? Obviously we don’t know, but at least we know more names and faces. Maybe this time will awaken people to what’s really important in life (beauty and friendship, rather than possessions), to the people they depend on who are often badly-paid and insecure, to the risks of unlimited foreign travel. I hope so.\nGovernment logic and its limitations\nMarch 28th: Our UK Gov’t has been much criticised. My interpretation is this. They believed (probably rightly) that nearly everyone would catch the virus before immunity and/or vaccine took effect. Therefore, it was pointless to try to delay the inevitable, including amongst medical staff, as economic harm would be bad and would also cause deaths. Moreover, the vast majority of deaths would be amongst the elderly, and would be those quite likely to die within the year (noting that the normal death rate in the UK is about 50,000 per month – rarely mentioned).\nWhat this also assumes, I think, is that people simply divide into those that die and those that don’t. What it leaves out is four things. Firstly, a significant minority of those who die might be saved with sufficient care, hence staffing and ventilators etc are needed. Secondly, a delay in the peak gives more time to develop treatments. Thirdly, it’s been said that a higher ‘load’ of the virus not only increases the chance of catching it, but also the severity of the illness – this is pertinent to medical staff and why PPE is important. Lastly, good treatment might make death less painful even where it’s inevitable. It’s also possible that, if many can avoid it altogether this year, a vaccine might save them in a second wave.\nThere’s also been accusations of ideology, callousness, etc. I’m doubtful about those. I imagine both many cock-ups as a complex situation develops, and a genuine philosophical difficulty for those (like Johnson) who believe people do best with less regulation and then must adjust to imposing rules. There’s also a balance to be struck between doing the right thing logically, and being seen to do something. Johnson’s latest approval ratings suggest that he’s succeeded with that, at least!\nLocked down\nMarch 28th. Already semi-retired, and with neither young nor old to care for, I’m fairly used to time in the house, but not to an empty diary: no days at work, Metro rides, evening meetings, and fewer walks, though the beach is wide and sparse. Our street now has a chatty What’sApp group and a red/green flag for windows. More bicycles than cars sometimes too! With relatives and acquaintances seriously ill, we know it’s deadly despite our own comfort.\nTotally unreal!\nMarch 21st: I’ve read some novels about things like ‘after the nuclear holocaust’, plagues, etc, and Wyndham’s stories such as Day of the Triffids and The Chrysalids, and seen films too, such as ‘Children of Men’ (in which children are no longer born for some unknown reason). They were interesting, intriguing, slightly scary. I grew up and became an adult at a time when nuclear war seemed a possibility (though it’s not gone away entirely). One question that was addressed by all of them was how people might behave when scared, stressed, hungry. They usually told of a mixture of noble, communal, self-sacrificing behaviour, and selfish, wild, panicky behaviour. I think we see aspects of this already in this extraordinary crisis.\nI’m an optimist, not always predicting good outcomes, but always believing that good things can happen. Right now, I know there will be many tragedies, many deaths, much unemployment, but still hope that society will prevail, health and well-being restored, the very worst avoided. Might the UK run short of food, even if we’re well-organised in time, if other countries restricted exports because of their own problems? I doubt we’ll get any severe shortage, but we are likely to see local problems, and less choice. I wonder how much we can cut down on food waste, which we’re told is 30% overall. Maybe the law should relax to allow shops to sell goods a little past their dates, but we must also accept more vegetables in imperfect condition, boxes and tins with dents, and throw away very little in our own houses.\nI hope selfishness and panic will very soon be replaced by care, organisation, patience, and that we might see the best in people predominating. My optimism says we will, but my realism also says that there will be problems, profiteering, and lots of worry. I also hope that we might recognise better what’s really important, and that unlimited travel has its drawbacks. Maybe also the greater collective efforts and interventionist government could help us tackle the climate emergency?\nUK policy – seriously wrong, or possibly honest?\nMarch 16th: The quick answer – I don’t know! There are lots of people arguing, and ‘scientists’ are quoted, though many are not epidemiologists. It seems to me that assumptions are being made by all sides. I think the UK policy is roughly this:\n- It’s likely that almost everyone will get this virus sooner or later, within the next year before any reliable vaccine is available. In any case, a vaccine might be only partially effective (like all flu jabs), as the virus could mutate.\n- More testing won’t necessarily achieve anything as such, if 1. is correct.\n- If so, then how can the peak be lowered and timed to allow best management by the NHS? Answer: by accepting a growing number of cases, whilst minimising effects on the most vulnerable.\n- Banning gatherings at an early stage might just postpone the peak, or be unsustainable and make it harder later. Closing schools in particular could lead to a greater shortage of medical and emergency personnel.\n- Things that affect economic activity will have other effects, including poverty and hence other health problems.\nWhat’s wrong with all this? Well, the point about general infection and vaccines might well be true, but time to build up equipment (ventilators) and expertise will reduce deaths. We don’t know to what extent that’s been considered (but a relative of mine in France is getting a novel treatment, so knowledge will increase).\nIf a good vaccine can be developed in a year or so, then maybe stricter restrictions that reduce overall infection rates would be worth the social costs, but we won’t know for months yet. Vaccine development might in any case be slower than this.\nAssumption 1. is key. WHO policy, that many think should be followed here, is based, I think, on the different assumption that overall infection rates can be held at a lower level and the disease eradicated or prevented by vaccination. That was clearly appropriate for Ebola.\nWhere our Government is clearly in the wrong is, firstly, that intensive care beds are at a low level, and there are significant shortages of nurses – they are responsible for that over the past ten years. Brexit policy is likely to make staff shortages much worse. And secondly, they could have ordered more ventilators weeks earlier – that alone might save lives.\nCoronavirus – everyone’s an expert!\nMarch 14th: For once, I think Boris Johnson might be showing some courage. He looks terrible – haggard and short of confidence. For perhaps the first time in his life he’s fully aware of major responsibility, and of decisions on which lives depend and on which he’ll be judged. The Government policy of ramping up more steadily than others has logic, though it’s not up to me (or most of us) to judge if it’s correct. What they have definitely got wrong is to start with a shortage of nurses and beds, and having damaged relationships with other countries. A complete lock-down at an early stage would probably delay the peak more, provided people didn’t tire of restrictions, and that economic hardship didn’t cause death and disease through poverty (as well as absence of medical staff). However, unless an effective vaccine were available within 6-9 months, a second wave of infections next winter, on a much larger scale, could be a disaster.\nBrexit – what a mess!\nMarch 2020: A while since I posted here – so much to think about. Johnson got his majority in December, so he could claim to ‘get Brexit done’, but really only just getting started. I rather hoped his monomaniac approach, including choosing such a loyal if untalented Cabinet, would give way to some realism, but it was not to be. He still has a crazy Cabinet, and an apparent belief that incredibly complex negotiations can be done in a few months. Three possibilities: 1. He’s genuinely OK with the idea of a hard Brexit. 2. He’ll extend the transition after all. 3. He’s going to cave in on most EU requirements. My own view is that ‘no-deal’ is improbable. Why? Because he likes being popular, and medicine shortages and the loss of industries like Nissan would make him very unpopular. I predict a mix of 2 and 3.\nPreserving our beautiful world\n30th December: Listening to Greta Thunberg on the radio – showing how much difference an individual can make. Before that, David Attenborough and Mark Carney, all emphasising the need for urgent action. Individual actions saving energy all make a small contribution but also help to show governments what voters want.\nDisappointment but not despair\nSunday 15th: The bad news – a substantial majority for the Conservatives, gained by constant lying, unrealistic promises, little information about what a Brexit deal might look like, and vague threats against the judiciary, the press, etc. The good news – doubling our vote in both constituencies of North Tyneside and Tynemouth (around 7%). The questions: will Johnson use his majority to ignore the hard right and make a sensible deal? will the Labour Party find a sensible leader and become an effective opposition? will the Lib Dems find a distinctive purpose under a new leader? will the state of Labour and Conservative parties lead to yet more gains for Lib Dems in local elections?",

For perhaps the first time in his life he’s fully aware of major responsibility, and of decisions on which lives depend and on which he’ll be judged. The Government policy of ramping up more steadily than others has logic, though it’s not up to me (or most of us) to judge if it’s correct. What they have definitely got wrong is to start with a shortage of nurses and beds, and having damaged relationships with other countries. A complete lock-down at an early stage would probably delay the peak more, provided people didn’t tire of restrictions, and that economic hardship didn’t cause death and disease through poverty (as well as absence of medical staff). However, unless an effective vaccine were available within 6-9 months, a second wave of infections next winter, on a much larger scale, could be a disaster.\nBrexit – what a mess!\nMarch 2020: A while since I posted here – so much to think about. Johnson got his majority in December, so he could claim to ‘get Brexit done’, but really only just getting started. I rather hoped his monomaniac approach, including choosing such a loyal if untalented Cabinet, would give way to some realism, but it was not to be. He still has a crazy Cabinet, and an apparent belief that incredibly complex negotiations can be done in a few months. Three possibilities: 1. He’s genuinely OK with the idea of a hard Brexit. 2. He’ll extend the transition after all. 3. He’s going to cave in on most EU requirements. My own view is that ‘no-deal’ is improbable. Why? Because he likes being popular, and medicine shortages and the loss of industries like Nissan would make him very unpopular. I predict a mix of 2 and 3.\nPreserving our beautiful world\n30th December: Listening to Greta Thunberg on the radio – showing how much difference an individual can make. Before that, David Attenborough and Mark Carney, all emphasising the need for urgent action. Individual actions saving energy all make a small contribution but also help to show governments what voters want.\nDisappointment but not despair\nSunday 15th: The bad news – a substantial majority for the Conservatives, gained by constant lying, unrealistic promises, little information about what a Brexit deal might look like, and vague threats against the judiciary, the press, etc. The good news – doubling our vote in both constituencies of North Tyneside and Tynemouth (around 7%). The questions: will Johnson use his majority to ignore the hard right and make a sensible deal? will the Labour Party find a sensible leader and become an effective opposition? will the Lib Dems find a distinctive purpose under a new leader? will the state of Labour and Conservative parties lead to yet more gains for Lib Dems in local elections?",

There’s always been rumours, and wild statements made to mates in the pub, but social media spreads those like wild-fire, and it’s impossible to retract a rumour. Some Conservative politicians and commentators, and some from Labour too, have tried to argue that the riots were protests about ‘legitimate concerns’, and even tried to draw parallels with the pro-Gaza and climate protests, but those were predominantly peaceful and even the more extreme elements kept to verbal attacks in almost all cases. These were riots, led by thugs, and incited by some who want chaos and hate democracy.\nHowever, it’s also clear that poverty, poor or non-existent housing, long waiting lists, etc. have given many people a feeling of being ignored and neglected, and that probably contributed to the larger numbers giving tacit encouragement to those with a violent agenda. Again, those grievances have been amplified by some who have contributed to the problems now being articulated, ironically under a new Labour government that’s far more likely to address these.\nI’m not a paid-up Starmer supporter, but it’s absurd to label him a failure after a month of the new regime. Yes, he’s already made some mistakes, but he’s clearly more honest, more competent, more serious than his several predecessors, and it’s only fair to suspend judgement until he’d had a few months to demonstrate what his priorities really are. What is clear though is that people will want to see at least signs of progress on housing, waiting lists and some other costs before too long, and such signs will also help tackle the scapegoating of migrants.",

Here’s some questions we can ask:\n– What is best done collectively, and what individually?\n– What is best done by the state, and what by private companies?\n– What’s the right balance between regulation for the general good and individual and corporate freedom?\n– What’s best done locally, regionally, nationally or internationally?\n– What is the right balance of short-term and long-term needs?\n– What’s the balance: high gain and high risk, vs. lower gain and risk?\nThese aren’t the only questions, but they do cover much of the political ground.\nI think most people would recognise these as valid questions, and almost no-one would adopt either extreme for each example, except possibly the second question for some ideologues of the Left or the Right. A typical Conservative voter would probably say ‘more to the right’ for the first three questions, and a typical Labour voter would probably say ‘more to the left’ for all three. A typical Liberal Democrat position would probably be fairly central on the first two questions, slightly to the right on the regulation/freedom axis, but with a strong emphasis on the fourth question – making decisions at the right level.\nAnother aspect of government is that, in my view, there is no perfect and stable state to be achieved. At any time, one can only say ‘the balance is wrong’, and try to shift it. That’s because we are a complex society with many individual views and needs, and external factors too.

Here’s my summary of the issue:\n- The public will be using simple masks, not medical grade.\n- These screen out only some droplets, not all.\n- Removing them can transfer the virus.\n- They’ll need frequent washing.\n- They might make people complacent.\n- Hand washing and distancing needed too!",

I’ve been busy attempting to answer around 200 individual emails from electors (I’m about 2/3 through so far), so only today managed to respond, as follows:\nAnswers to questions from Northern Echo:\n- What are three key local issues facing your constituency, and how would you address them? The first is the probable consequences of Brexit in any form, which is predicted to hit the North-East hardest (11% drop in economy relative to where we should be). This will require Government investment – see my answer to qu 5 below. There is potential in this region for major work on environmental improvements in the offshore industry – wind power in particular. This would be part of an overall push towards a greener economy. The Liberal Democrat manifesto urges a £100bn investment in environmental measures; a good chunk of that needs to come to areas like the North East.\n- This question doesn’t rule out national issues, in my view, where they’ll have a local effect. Therefore, my second priority is Health and Social Care, which is in crisis. It needed sorting anyway, but substantial cuts in central government grants to local authorities have made it harder and harder to deal with. Both major parties have failed on this, partly because they keep trying to gain political advantage and so won’t agree on a plan. Thirdly, although schools are quite good in North Tyneside, overall participation in Higher Education is low in the North-East, and Further Education is also badly-funded. Therefore more support for FE, making apprenticeships easier to set up, and encouragement to aim higher still, are all needed. Better FE and apprenticeships could also help the rural parts of this area. Environmental education is already being encouraged somewhat by the North of Tyne authority, but there is so much more to do.\n- Leave, remain or second referendum – what is your stance on Brexit, and why? Remain. The EU has brought peace to Europe, increased trade, increased opportunities for travel and employment, given us greater influence internationally with giants like the US and China, and also gives the best hope of concerted action on the Environment. But the EU does need reform.\n- Should people be prepared to pay additional tax to fund improvements in public services, like the NHS? Yes, extra tax is needed to pay for better services. Of the major parties, only the Liberal Democrats are honest in saying this, and our manifesto has been commended by the Institute for Financial Studies for its realism and honesty about this. Conservatives pretend that improvements can be funded with no tax rises (and despite tax cuts), whilst Labour claim it can all be funded by the rich – seriously doubted by IFS.\n- High streets are struggling – what would you do to rescue them? This combines with other Environmental and Health issues. We need to encourage more walking and cycling for both reasons, and better provision of, and use of, public transport. The revived Blyth and Ashington line, improvements to Metro, etc. will help, but we need to reduce private car and polluting diesel use from our town centres to make them more pleasant places to spend the day. A completely new approach to Business Rates, replacing with a land-value tax, would be helpful too, reducing the advantage that on-line and out-of-town retail currently has over conventional urban shopping.\n- What does the Northern Powerhouse need to make it work? The Northern Powerhouse was a good idea, but needs more investment and powers to determine its own future. A key investment is in improved rail connections within the North, not just to London. Devolution and reform of business rates would also help. The UK is one of the most centralised administrations in Europe, with too much in London and far too little elsewhere. In the North-East I like to say: ‘We used to have the Carbon; we’ve still got the Energy!’.",

The Government appears to pay little heed to this, maybe because it would also highlight the major shortages caused by Brexit.\nThat Omicron seems to lead to less serious illness and death is a relief, but a smaller proportion of a larger case-load is still a major burden. We have to hope that high vaccination rates and milder variants will allow some greater relaxation by the summer. Meanwhile, apart from the actual policies, we have a Government that appears careless, dismissive, arrogant and incompetent. Let’s hope that we get a new Prime Minister soon who can actually do the job, not merely be popular with Conservative members!",

This sport, which Bill Shankly famously described as ‘not a matter of life and death, it’s more important than that’, dominates the news. Leading politicians denounce ‘greed’ (unlike that of Cabinet ministers and their mates, of course). Of course it’s important to discuss something that is so popular, but is it really the Government’s business, if at all, and particularly when there’s so much else that they should be sorting out?\nI’m pleased to hear of the imminent commitment by the UK Government (and the US Government too) to stringent targets for greenhouse gas reductions, and heartened to read of specific initiatives in the UK and elsewhere, but targets aren’t good enough, and announcing an announcement, plus the football kerfuffle, does look like an attempt to distract from the ‘cronyism’ and NI border rows.",

There’s always been rumours, and wild statements made to mates in the pub, but social media spreads those like wild-fire, and it’s impossible to retract a rumour. Some Conservative politicians and commentators, and some from Labour too, have tried to argue that the riots were protests about ‘legitimate concerns’, and even tried to draw parallels with the pro-Gaza and climate protests, but those were predominantly peaceful and even the more extreme elements kept to verbal attacks in almost all cases. These were riots, led by thugs, and incited by some who want chaos and hate democracy.\nHowever, it’s also clear that poverty, poor or non-existent housing, long waiting lists, etc. have given many people a feeling of being ignored and neglected, and that probably contributed to the larger numbers giving tacit encouragement to those with a violent agenda. Again, those grievances have been amplified by some who have contributed to the problems now being articulated, ironically under a new Labour government that’s far more likely to address these.\nI’m not a paid-up Starmer supporter, but it’s absurd to label him a failure after a month of the new regime. Yes, he’s already made some mistakes, but he’s clearly more honest, more competent, more serious than his several predecessors, and it’s only fair to suspend judgement until he’d had a few months to demonstrate what his priorities really are. What is clear though is that people will want to see at least signs of progress on housing, waiting lists and some other costs before too long, and such signs will also help tackle the scapegoating of migrants.",

  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_category_uncategorised/content_9.html": "April 22nd: When politics comes up in conversation, it usually focusses on one or two principal events or policies, that someone either likes or dislikes, or on politicians – commonly ‘they’re all the same’ or ‘they’re only in it for themselves’. It’s much less common to hear people’s comments on what a politician, or a council or a government is able to do. Comments are also expressed in black/white terms (‘the railways are bad’ or ‘our money is wasted’) when what’s probably meant is more about how bad, or how much (‘my train has been late three times this week’ or ‘that was a waste of money’).\nIt’s worth considering what Politics is actually concerned with. Here’s some questions we can ask:\n– What is best done collectively, and what individually?\n– What is best done by the state, and what by private companies?\n– What’s the right balance between regulation for the general good and individual and corporate freedom?\n– What’s best done locally, regionally, nationally or internationally?\n– What is the right balance of short-term and long-term needs?\n– What’s the balance: high gain and high risk, vs. lower gain and risk?\nThese aren’t the only questions, but they do cover much of the political ground.\nI think most people would recognise these as valid questions, and almost no-one would adopt either extreme for each example, except possibly the second question for some ideologues of the Left or the Right. A typical Conservative voter would probably say ‘more to the right’ for the first three questions, and a typical Labour voter would probably say ‘more to the left’ for all three. A typical Liberal Democrat position would probably be fairly central on the first two questions, slightly to the right on the regulation/freedom axis, but with a strong emphasis on the fourth question – making decisions at the right level.\nAnother aspect of government is that, in my view, there is no perfect and stable state to be achieved. At any time, one can only say ‘the balance is wrong’, and try to shift it. That’s because we are a complex society with many individual views and needs, and external factors too. Even in small organisations, there will be periods when collective action and benefit seems the right priority, and other periods when individual benefits and freedoms need to be addressed.",

In the UK, we’re certain to have a Labour government, but we don’t yet know how Starmer and his acolytes will work, having shown real ruthlessness both in reforming the party and in managing candidate selection and messaging. With statements on immigration and on nuclear defence in recent days, we must hope they haven’t gone too far in saying what people want to hear.\nIn the US, there’s some hope that swing voters and reasonable Republicans (of whom some still exist) will be put off Trump even if they don’t welcome Biden. But in France it looks likely Macron will struggle to keep any kind of centrist government, and there are populist movements in other countries too.\nWhen people are frustrated or struggling with life they seem more likely to vote for parties with simple messages, rather than those who seem to have promised improvements that are slow to come or seem to benefit others.

Since then, the pattern is more complex, and prediction would be very rash until we have more data and more understanding.

The rich (the elite) carried on with their privileged wealth and opportunities (who you know, not what you know), significant change was ridiculed, and, worse, abuse of authority and power covered up abuse of children, women, blacks and other disadvantaged groups. And young people from poorer backgrounds were discouraged from ambition and vision, even from speaking out about specific abuse or dishonesty.\nIt’s good that we can challenge authority when it’s smug, abusive or corrupt. Changes are always needed, and although new ideas need challenge and scrutiny, everyone has a right to propose improvements and to be heard in some forum or other.\nHowever, it’s not good at all if we can’t trust experts most of the time, on vaccines, diet or climate. Experts in education are needed to avoid simplistic or reactionary notions. Criminal justice is more complex than the public mostly realises, with some ‘solutions’ making the problems worse.

The Conservatives sounding increasingly desperate, Labour trying not to sound complacent, and Ed Davey making a real splash!\nThe only prediction I’m making is this: Labour will win, Conservatives will lose loads of seats, Lib Dems will gain MPs. I’m really hoping for at least 30, and we might get over 50. That would actually mean our seat share was similar to our vote share, for the first time, at 10-12%. We won’t be formally part of the Government, but we will get greater representation on committees and more chances to influence things.\nIn the unlikely event we beat the Conservatives (in seats), we’d be the official Opposition. That would mean all sorts of benefits. Six questions each week at PMQs. Several days each year to put our own business before the HoC. Security briefings. LOTO to be on the Privy Council. More staff. More BBC coverage. The Conservatives would fade into the background much of the time!\nTomorrow night I’ll be up until 2am or 3am, but Tynemouth might declare earlier than usual, as the boundary changes mean that our local council has only one constituency to count and declare. Better in any case than 2010, when a badly-organised count kept me there until 6.30am.",

We need to see this area, and the whole North East, thriving, in the lead, known to all.\nAs Mayor, John would DEMAND BETTER:\n- Better Devolution – putting decisions at the right level, in the hands of those most affected and most knowledgeable\n- Better Environment – to look at, to work in, and helping preserve a wonderful place for our children and grandchildren\n- Better Education – getting more young people (and older people) into education, better jobs, more satisfaction\nExperience\nJohn has been a Newcastle councillor as part of a Liberal Democrat administration, Head of a large Engineering School (£14M budget, 140 staff, 900 students), charity trustee, union branch president, school governor, and serves on local and national church committees.\nPragmatism\nI don’t have dogmatic ideas – trying to make the same solution fit every problem, but I’m willing to pick the best and ask advice. The other parties have their strengths, but tend to assume one size fits all. I’m a Liberal Democrat, believing in local decision-making but with an international outlook, but I’ll work with all partners. Let’s see what works!\nA critical friend of Europe\nThe UK has benefited from a close relationship with Europe, from beneficial trade deals, people both highly-skilled and transient, higher standards on food, workers’ rights and the Environment, and greater influence in an interconnected world.\nThe EU has its faults – bureaucracy, weakness in managing disagreement, areas where it wants more power (but hasn’t usually got it!). But walking away is the wrong answer – throwing away deals, relationships, influence – and thinking we can bargain better on our own with the giant US and China.\nAny form of Brexit will hit the North East hardest. But my Labour and Conservative opponents can’t give a straight answer on the biggest issue facing North of Tyne.",

I’ll be setting out my priorities here, and in the booklet circulated to 100,000 households, in the next few weeks.\nThe national picture was already bleak before the past couple of weeks. The Government has a difficult job to make good the mess left behind by fourteen years of dogmatic and unwise austerity, coupled with incompetence and, of course, damage from Brexit. However, Starmer’s and Reeves’ determination to appear tough on budgetting and other long-term issues, means people still feel they have a government that doesn’t care about them. And the latest cut to foreign aid is both tragic and foolish, as our security and trade are helped by development, and migration can only get worse without action on climate and conflict.\nAnd now we have a madman in the White House, aided by billionaires who are greedy and apparently stupid too. We do need to increase defence spending, yet so much has been wasted equipping our forces to ‘fight the last war’, with faulty and under-armed aircraft carriers, tanks never likely to be used, and far too little anti-cyber technology, drones, and soldiers.\nBack to local issues, though they’re all linked to national and international pressures and finance. We need to do all we can to build and preserve a great environment for health, leisure and for our young people. We need to ensure best value-for-money for the limited resources we have. And we need to make a strong case for more funding and powers to be devolved to our region.\nAnd in all these, we need to be sure that the frequent ‘consultations’ do really reflect the true balance of public opinion, not merely the voices of those who shout loudest.\nAs Mayor, these would be my priorities: Environment, Value for Money, Public voice.\nMore details in the next few weeks!",

Rumblings from discontented backbenchers and former ministers, but nervousness that an attempt to unseat him will fail and make things worse. He should never have been shortlisted for the membership to vote on a leader, just as Corbyn shouldn’t have been for Labour, giving the electorate an invidious choice in 2019. It’s nonsense to think there’s no suitable replacement, though some talented and (more) principled MPs might be reluctant to spend two years mopping up only to lose a General Election and share some of the blame.\nAnd a huge £15bn support package, whilst essential, looks like both an attempted distraction and a complete contradiction of what’s been said and believed by this Government. Their MPs were whipped only a few days ago to vote against a windfall tax, which Labour are now crowing about, but which in fact was called for by the Lib Dems some months earlier!\nMay 19th: The Met Police were reluctant to investigate lockdown parties at no. 10, presumably thinking they’d be accused of political interference whatever their findings. They were eventually persuaded to look into twelve events, and investigated eight of them, finally issuing Fixed Penalty Notices to 126 people. But Boris Johnson received just one £50 fine, despite at least ‘dropping in’ to several parties, apparently on the flimsy basis that no. 10 is his home and so he was working in most cases. However, junior civil servants who cooperated initially with the Sue Gray internal report have been issued with many of the fines, possibly partially as a result of their confessions. They are reportedly furious!\nDurham police are, meanwhile, investigatingone event that Keir Starmer was at. If they find Starmer guilty of an offence (for which he’s promised to resign), that would seem grossly unfair, as there was clearly no culture of negligence in his case, at most a marginal misinterpretation of the rules. I trust that their investigation is to demonstrate political neutrality, knowing that the Government was under investigation.\nMaybe the Sue Gray report will strengthen the case that the Government, and Johnson in particular, were careless, negligent, dismissive, arrogant. I do hope that the public will continue to grow in their distrust of this selfish, arrogant and dishonest man, so that either he’s forced out of office or that he leads his party to a truly dreadful result in the General Election that must come by 2024.\nMay 9th: A huge shock for the Government, losing 487 council seats, consistently down in the polls, and with Labour more trusted than them on almost every criterion. But bigger still, they are threatened in their heartlands, particularly the South and South-West, by the Liberal Democrat surge, gaining 222 seats and 3 councils (returning to the same number of controlled councils as c. 2010). After Chesham & Amersham and North Shropshire, there are two tasty by-elections coming up too. The Government is finally looking very vulnerable.\nMay 4th: Many Conservative councillors are distancing themselves from their own party in government, with slogans such as ‘Local Conservatives’ and, even further, ‘Don’t punish local Conservatives for the mistakes made in Westminster’. The North Tyneside group have published pseudo-Green leaflets aiming to get some Labour voters to switch and save a few marginal Tory councillors. A tiny imprint has ‘NTCF’ (Conservative Federation), but for most people they look like Green Party leaflets, which they’re not! After all, it was local Conservative members who voted in Johnson as leader and hence Prime Minister, when his character and history were well-known.\nThis distancing is not new. During the Coalition years (whatever you think of that period), many local Lib Dem councillors lost their seats owing to general unhappiness with the national policies and compromises, and some campaigned with the designation ‘Focus Team’ and no mention of ‘Liberal Democrat’. I doubt this is effective and might even be counter-productive.\nBy Friday morning, we’ll see if there is indeed a substantial national swing in seat numbers, but it will be measured against 2018, when Theresa May’s government was already unpopular. Locally, the Lib Dems have a strong challenge in Weetslade ward, and the Greens in Whitley Bay. We share some aims (environment, and the need for scrutiny and challenge to this Labour ‘one-party state’), but remain distinct parties, especially at national level, where the Greens try to defend their ‘leave NATO’ policy – not at all sensible at this time!\nApril 19th: Desperate to displace headlines about lawbreaking at Number 10, and to shore up their ’base’, this dreadful Government have proposed an appalling plan for refugees – condemned by almost everyone who’s thought about the issue at all. The Civil Service are constrained, but have said it’s unclear whether it will be effective and hence value for money. It’s dishonest in that the UK takes a relatively small number of refugees, most of those crossing the Channel are genuine, and alternative safe and legal routes have been closed. It’s ineffective, as a deterrent works only if it’s known. It’s illegal, as it fails to deal properly with refugees. And it’s unethical and cruel. Perhaps most bizarre of all, Rees-Mogg asserts that it’s ’redemptive’. My view is much as Pope Francis’.\nApril 11th: Rishi Sunak impressed the public with his charm, confidence and ‘generosity’ with public spending. Many (including him!) thought he might be the next Prime Minister, but I always wondered – we knew nothing of any vision for the UK, ability in managing the executive decision-making or skill in building and managing a team. We did know that he’d been a hedge-fund manager, good at making money from insubstantial investments and manipulation of markets. In the past few weeks, his fall from grace has been spectacular – a budget that failed to address the cost-of-living crisis, apparent opposition to sensible energy/climate plans, and then his wife’s non-dom status for her fantastic wealth. Then, on top of all that. questions about his US and UK status.\nOn Thursday I was visiting Richmond in North Yorkshire, his constituency, and was by chance interviewed by an ITV team seeking the views of local residents. They featured my views at some length: https://twitter.com/ITVNewsPolitics/status/1512098733554610187 Some of the comments following the clip are hilarious! I was quite honest with them about who I was but they evidently thought the clip worth keeping. The whole tweet was re-tweeted by Wes Streeting (Shadow Cabinet), so it had lots of views!\nApril 6th: Today the National Insurance increase is implemented. On top of huge rises in energy costs, and a continuing squeeze on benefits and local authority budgets, times will be hard for many families. Yes, it’s possible to manage on less, and people used to know more about how to do that, but life wasn’t very good for many in those ‘nostalgic times’, and in any case, why should ordinary families be told to put up with things by people who don’t have to? When coupled with a casual and hypocritical attitude to the pandemic rules by Downing street, it’s clear that this Government is seriously out of touch. Many people remain to be convinced that Labour is ready for government, but increasingly they (and the Liberal Democrats) are seen as a serious party who cares.\nThe Government is also out of touch on other issues. Most people oppose the selling off of Channel 4 – pointless except as a piece of dogma. Most people are supportive of more on-shore wind turbines and against fracking, yet the Government is against one and favours the other. People support more Ukrainian refugees, but the Home Office makes that very difficult. They appear to be completely wrapped up in their own rhetoric. It’s to be hoped that they lose power sooner rather than later!\nThe immediate prospect of a challenge to the Government will come on May 5th in the local elections. Although primarily about local issues, and distorted to some extent by dissatisfaction that results from national funding but which impinges on other parties, it seems likely that many usual Conservative voters will stay at home, whilst opposition voters will turn out with greater enthusiasm. In North Tyneside, there are prospects of more opposition councillors from the Lib Dems and the Greens, who both had impressive gains in target wards. Although the overall political ‘colour’ of the two is very different, we share the aims of addressing the climate change, holding the local council to account, and scrutinising plans and decisions to set better priorities and ensure value for money.\nMarch 14th: I’ve just watched short videos of arrests in Russian cities – one of a protestor with a card saying, literally, ‘two words’, and the other with a card that was completely blank. The Russian government is afraid of criticism. Much of its attitude is even more rooted in the past than Britain’s current nostalgia of ‘Dad’s Army’ and ‘Britannia rules the waves’.\nBut it’s also true that our governments have failed to tell the truth, in the sense of both words and actions. The belief that economic engagement would convert Russia, China and other autocracies to our liberal democracy was naive. Of course engagement, and particularly educating foreign students, is part of what’s needed, but sterner stuff must also be shown when such trust is clearly abused, as in Salisbury, Crimea, Syria, and substantial dependence on Russian energy supplies was a real risk, especially coupled with inadequate storage.\nAt the same time, our governments have failed to be honest with us about the need to pay our way – in taxes sufficient to provide the services we value, and in balancing our trade so that foreign investment can be selective rather than uncritical. The ‘golden visa’ scheme was always a terrible idea (actually introduced under Gordon Brown!), but should at least have had safeguards, notably a restriction on political donations for an initial period.\nIt’s commonplace to say ‘they’re all liars’ about our politicians, whilst expecting unrealistic things to be done, and voting for the best promises rather than the honest but more mundane ‘we’ll do what we can’. Vision is great, exaggerated promises are not.\nFebruary 8th: I decided some years ago that I hate dogma. That’s not a particular dogma, just all of it! There might be a very few exceptions, but these would be a few ‘truths’ for me, such as statements about the importance of truth itself, honesty, the value of human beings, the need to look after the world for the sake of our children and grandchildren, etc.\nDogma means (to me) an explicit statement of a belief that the holder is unwilling to question. I have no objection to strong beliefs, strongly argued, it’s the closed-mindedness that’s the problem, the ‘black-and-white’ view of the subject or the world. Just now, it’s party politics that’s at the forefront of my mind, but I will mention one other area.\nBoris Johnson shouldn’t be Prime Minister. Increasingly, that’s a view held by many Conservative voters and MPs, as well as almost all others. It’s commonly said that by continuing to support him in post, those people are ‘putting party before country’, or ‘putting their own careers before principles’. I don’t think it’s so simple, though I’m not excusing it. It’s clear to me that for many of these MPs (and voters), there is a strong conviction that a Conservative government is best for the country, certainly in the longer-term and probably in the medium-term too. That is, even with doubts and problems at present, they continue to think that a Labour government will be worse for the country overall than almost any conceivable government by ‘their’ party. In this sense, they might believe they are putting country before anything else. Of course, an element of personal career is relevant, but the argument extends easily to: ‘I’ll be a better MP for my constituency than my opponent, because of my core values.’\nWhilst I understand this mentality up to a point, it’s dangerous, as it can lead incrementally to acceptance, even advocacy, of bad policy, bad behaviour, bad management, etc. Surely most Conservative MPs would not have supported Johnson so willingly in 2019 if they’d known in advance how he might behave, how little he valued them, their opinions, their values.\nA dogmatic position that says, in effect: any Conservative government, however bad, is always better than any Labour government, however good, is not a rational position, it’s a black-and-white dogma and should be called out and given no power. Of course, the same would be true for the converse.\nHere’s my other example: When I was young, homosexuality was unknown, then weird, then a joke, then strange, then gradually more a fact of life. However, until I was about 25-30, I wasn’t wholly comfortable with this, whilst trying hard to be accepting. What finally brought me ‘off the fence’ was this: To hold the traditional view (of heterosexual lifelong marriage) was, in effect, to judge that any traditional marriage relationship, however bad, was automatically better than any other form of relationship, however good. That is, a dogmatic traditional position was clearly wrong and untenable for me. Thereafter, I accepted the validity and value of all good, committed, respectful relationships, hetero- or homo-sexual, whilst still rejecting any relationship that didn’t meet those values, or didn’t try hard to. I could add other rejected dogmas to these two, but that’s enough for today!\nJanuary 23rd: Boris Johnson is on the ropes, by all accounts and appearances. Parties (in no.10, in the garden, in his flat), threats to MPs, Islamophobia, on top of general dishonesty and incompetence, factional strife in his Party, and a growing cost-of-living crisis contribute to, at last, public opinion that he should resign or be sacked, with someone competent and honest in his place. Will it happen? Yes! Will it happen this week? Unclear.\nWho would replace him? Sunak is front-runner, but we have no idea of his vision or competence, just his manner, and he has apparently little sympathy for the poor or the environment. If he takes over, then I hope the many problems are not shrugged off by him as ‘not his fault’, as any incoming PM must be seen to do something to alleviate them. I hope too that he doesn’t take over soon enough to get the benefit of the doubt in the May elections, but late enough for his competence to be as yet unclear.\nPM is a job I’ll never have and couldn’t do, as my skin isn’t thick enough even if I had the ability! However, I sometimes think of what my first priorities might be in that position. Top of the list would be to reduce hostility and polarisation in Parliament, in the UK, with our European neighbours and beyond, for without that little effective governance is possible. I’d stop the hostility to asylum-seekers, but maybe process some in France if possible, with a clearer legal route otherwise to minimise the ‘boats’ problem.\nI’d maintain masks in most indoor places to slow the pandemic, and slow the NHS vaccination deadline just a little to get more acceptance. I’d have a windfall tax on energy companies to offset the recent price rises and/or other costs on the poor.\nFor NI, I’d agree an SPS deal to ease the customs and border issues, and with the EU fix collaborations on Euratom, Horizon, and the musicians visa scheme. I’d revisit the Australia trade deal if possible to reinstate welfare and environmental standards.\nThere’s lots more! Much of the above doesn’t bring massive costs, but increases cooperation and trust, and partially tackles several crises. Good governance is more about the mundane than the dramatic, but honesty, trust and steady, small steps are usually the best way forward.",

Of course, an element of personal career is relevant, but the argument extends easily to: ‘I’ll be a better MP for my constituency than my opponent, because of my core values.’\nWhilst I understand this mentality up to a point, it’s dangerous, as it can lead incrementally to acceptance, even advocacy, of bad policy, bad behaviour, bad management, etc. Surely most Conservative MPs would not have supported Johnson so willingly in 2019 if they’d known in advance how he might behave, how little he valued them, their opinions, their values.\nA dogmatic position that says, in effect: any Conservative government, however bad, is always better than any Labour government, however good, is not a rational position, it’s a black-and-white dogma and should be called out and given no power. Of course, the same would be true for the converse.\nHere’s my other example: When I was young, homosexuality was unknown, then weird, then a joke, then strange, then gradually more a fact of life. However, until I was about 25-30, I wasn’t wholly comfortable with this, whilst trying hard to be accepting. What finally brought me ‘off the fence’ was this: To hold the traditional view (of heterosexual lifelong marriage) was, in effect, to judge that any traditional marriage relationship, however bad, was automatically better than any other form of relationship, however good. That is, a dogmatic traditional position was clearly wrong and untenable for me. Thereafter, I accepted the validity and value of all good, committed, respectful relationships, hetero- or homo-sexual, whilst still rejecting any relationship that didn’t meet those values, or didn’t try hard to. I could add other rejected dogmas to these two, but that’s enough for today!\nJanuary 23rd: Boris Johnson is on the ropes, by all accounts and appearances. Parties (in no.10, in the garden, in his flat), threats to MPs, Islamophobia, on top of general dishonesty and incompetence, factional strife in his Party, and a growing cost-of-living crisis contribute to, at last, public opinion that he should resign or be sacked, with someone competent and honest in his place. Will it happen? Yes! Will it happen this week? Unclear.\nWho would replace him? Sunak is front-runner, but we have no idea of his vision or competence, just his manner, and he has apparently little sympathy for the poor or the environment. If he takes over, then I hope the many problems are not shrugged off by him as ‘not his fault’, as any incoming PM must be seen to do something to alleviate them. I hope too that he doesn’t take over soon enough to get the benefit of the doubt in the May elections, but late enough for his competence to be as yet unclear.\nPM is a job I’ll never have and couldn’t do, as my skin isn’t thick enough even if I had the ability! However, I sometimes think of what my first priorities might be in that position. Top of the list would be to reduce hostility and polarisation in Parliament, in the UK, with our European neighbours and beyond, for without that little effective governance is possible. I’d stop the hostility to asylum-seekers, but maybe process some in France if possible, with a clearer legal route otherwise to minimise the ‘boats’ problem.\nI’d maintain masks in most indoor places to slow the pandemic, and slow the NHS vaccination deadline just a little to get more acceptance. I’d have a windfall tax on energy companies to offset the recent price rises and/or other costs on the poor.\nFor NI, I’d agree an SPS deal to ease the customs and border issues, and with the EU fix collaborations on Euratom, Horizon, and the musicians visa scheme. I’d revisit the Australia trade deal if possible to reinstate welfare and environmental standards.\nThere’s lots more! Much of the above doesn’t bring massive costs, but increases cooperation and trust, and partially tackles several crises. Good governance is more about the mundane than the dramatic, but honesty, trust and steady, small steps are usually the best way forward.",

We brought the finances under control and provided value for money (Council Tax rises at or below inflation), doubled recycling rates, and strengthened communities instead of the previous focus on the City Centre. This week the Newcastle LD group launch their manifesto for the May local elections. I was happy to join them for a presentation and discussion, with just a mention of the North of Tyne Mayoral election and, of course, Brexit (sigh!).\nJohn’s blog on current issues\nA fishy tale\n29th March: Brexit discussions in chaos in London, but I had a good morning visiting the Fish Quay at North Shields, meeting Nik Hanlon (managing director) and Adam Riley to hear about their exciting plans to refurbish the quay, develop more processing facilities, and expand visitor attractions. This project has the potential to maintain and perhaps expand jobs, as well as to promote the heritage of the Tyne and increase tourism. Moving the ferry landing (likely to happen) will also help bring people to the Fish Quay, some straight off the North Sea ferries?\nSustainable villages\n27th March: The North of Tyne area includes busy cities and large towns, mostly in the south-east of the area, but Northumberland is the most sparsely-populated county in England, with huge areas of beautiful countryside, villages, farms and hills. A real challenge for the Mayor will be to balance the needs of all these areas, and to help sustain rural life and industry.\nLast weekend I was knocking on doors in Longframlington, with local Liberal Democrats, finding out what the residents are most bothered about in their area. It’s not the most isolated of communities, with some people commuting into Morpeth, and with some shops and cafes, but its needs are not the same as the major towns.\nThe next generation\n22nd March: This morning I talked to Year 12 students at Duke’s Secondary School in Ashington. I explained some of the background and aims of the new North of Tyne Authority, and why I was standing for Mayor. Also why the South of Tyne authorities had been doubtful, linked to why powers here will be limited for now.\nThe students asked some good questions – about Environment, Transport, Brexit, Education, Representation, and why they should trust what I said! On trust, I said I’d always be honest if I didn’t know an answer, if the problem would take a long time to solve or was outside my powers, and I’m always willing to credit other individuals and parties for good policies and actions. I also said that representation, whether a school council, a Citizens’ Assembly (which I favour for setting local and regional priorities) or any other level, had to give real influence, not just cosmetic.\n100,000 strong\nMarch 19th: A very good meeting with representatives of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Issues that particularly concern these often quite small companies include cash-flow, owing to late payment by larger organisations, and the difficulties of competing in procurement for public works. We talked about how information and support might be improved to help people who often haven’t time or expert knowledge. I was amazed to discover that there are 100,000 sole-trader/self-employed businesses in the North-East, generating around £4 billion in economic activity. They are also interested in how to contribute to a carbon-neutral economy, and in improving skills training for staff.\nTown Centres fit for the Future\nMarch 17th: Conference debates this important issue, summarised by the LD spokesperson:\n“The crisis we are witnessing in our town centres is clear to us all. Whilst Brexit is partly responsible, at the root of the issue is our broken business rates system.\n“It is only right we welcome the benefits of the 21st century economy, but we cannot ignore the plight of our high streets and all those affected.

We brought the finances under control and provided value for money (Council Tax rises at or below inflation), doubled recycling rates, and strengthened communities instead of the previous focus on the City Centre. This week the Newcastle LD group launch their manifesto for the May local elections. I was happy to join them for a presentation and discussion, with just a mention of the North of Tyne Mayoral election and, of course, Brexit (sigh!).\nJohn’s blog on current issues\nA fishy tale\n29th March: Brexit discussions in chaos in London, but I had a good morning visiting the Fish Quay at North Shields, meeting Nik Hanlon (managing director) and Adam Riley to hear about their exciting plans to refurbish the quay, develop more processing facilities, and expand visitor attractions. This project has the potential to maintain and perhaps expand jobs, as well as to promote the heritage of the Tyne and increase tourism. Moving the ferry landing (likely to happen) will also help bring people to the Fish Quay, some straight off the North Sea ferries?\nSustainable villages\n27th March: The North of Tyne area includes busy cities and large towns, mostly in the south-east of the area, but Northumberland is the most sparsely-populated county in England, with huge areas of beautiful countryside, villages, farms and hills. A real challenge for the Mayor will be to balance the needs of all these areas, and to help sustain rural life and industry.\nLast weekend I was knocking on doors in Longframlington, with local Liberal Democrats, finding out what the residents are most bothered about in their area. It’s not the most isolated of communities, with some people commuting into Morpeth, and with some shops and cafes, but its needs are not the same as the major towns.\nThe next generation\n22nd March: This morning I talked to Year 12 students at Duke’s Secondary School in Ashington. I explained some of the background and aims of the new North of Tyne Authority, and why I was standing for Mayor. Also why the South of Tyne authorities had been doubtful, linked to why powers here will be limited for now.\nThe students asked some good questions – about Environment, Transport, Brexit, Education, Representation, and why they should trust what I said! On trust, I said I’d always be honest if I didn’t know an answer, if the problem would take a long time to solve or was outside my powers, and I’m always willing to credit other individuals and parties for good policies and actions. I also said that representation, whether a school council, a Citizens’ Assembly (which I favour for setting local and regional priorities) or any other level, had to give real influence, not just cosmetic.\n100,000 strong\nMarch 19th: A very good meeting with representatives of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Issues that particularly concern these often quite small companies include cash-flow, owing to late payment by larger organisations, and the difficulties of competing in procurement for public works. We talked about how information and support might be improved to help people who often haven’t time or expert knowledge. I was amazed to discover that there are 100,000 sole-trader/self-employed businesses in the North-East, generating around £4 billion in economic activity. They are also interested in how to contribute to a carbon-neutral economy, and in improving skills training for staff.\nTown Centres fit for the Future\nMarch 17th: Conference debates this important issue, summarised by the LD spokesperson:\n“The crisis we are witnessing in our town centres is clear to us all. Whilst Brexit is partly responsible, at the root of the issue is our broken business rates system.\n“It is only right we welcome the benefits of the 21st century economy, but we cannot ignore the plight of our high streets and all those affected. As more and more individuals switch to online retail, businesses are struggling and thousands of jobs are being lost.\n“Business rates should be replaced with a land value tax that encourages businesses to invest, whilst we must also empower local areas by reforming planning and supporting entrepreneurs.

I was reasonably pleased to come a ‘good third’ with 17% overall, and in second place in the Newcastle and Gateshead areas. Here’s the full results:\nAs well as the Independent, the successful candidate agreed verbally with me that ‘This shouldn’t really be a party-political position’, but in her speech of acceptance, mentioned the Labour Party about five times! In fact, I’m against direct election of any senior position, as voting by party or by quality of public speaking neglects the qualities often needed to do the actual job. The same problem occurred with Johnson and Corbyn – both popular in the constituencies that voted for them, and neither remotely suitable to do the full job of leadership.\nHowever, I do wish Susan Dungworth well and I’m sure she’ll work hard. I hope it works out well.\nSomewhat separately, a good few days for the Liberal Democrats, with over 100 councillors gained and high hopes for the long-awaited General Election.

Over the past few years there’s been a serious squeeze on budgets, offset to some extent recently by an allowance for additional officers (who must be trained and equipped, of course).\nNorthumbria Police are more dependent on their central Government grant than other forces, with the local ‘precept’ (addition to Council Tax) not much above half of the level of most police regions, so the recent 7% rise isn’t really much in that context. It’s very demanding to run an effective force with this level of support, and to deliver on the aims of trust in the police (not as good as we’d like), reducing and combatting crime, and maintaining standards at an outstanding level. They deserve our support, and we should base any views on what’s happening here, not stories from London and elsewhere!\nAmongst other things, we discussed coverage of the huge rural areas of Northumberland, and women’s confidence and safety. One year into her role, the Chief Constable also explained the way they are restructuring to give greater continuity and confidence to the public by giving officers a broader role throughout investigations, avoiding the ‘silo’ approach of different officers doing each stage.\nLots to take in, lots to learn, lots to discuss before making too many suggestions, but my priorities are crime prevention, working with youth, support for victims, and liaison with probation and the justice system to provide effective remedies and reduce re-offending.",

In fact, it’s further ahead of Labour than a few months ago, with the Lib Dems also polling poorly. Why is this? The answer is probably that people voted for Johnson and the Conservatives because (a) they rather liked him, and (b) they were suspicious of Corbyn, for his ‘friends’ and the worries about anti-semitism (unfair in that racism in the Conservative party hasn’t had the same attention).\nThe terrible death-toll of the pandemic, and the economic slow-down due to that and Brexit, should also count against Johnson.

  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_category_uncategorised_page_4/content_32.html": "March 2nd: Our inept Prime Minister, shackled to an almost hysterical right-wing, and facing electoral oblivion, makes a public speech about extremism and ‘mob rule’. I’ve said before that the thing I have most hated about the Governments we’ve had since 2016 (i.e. Johnson, May, Truss, Sunak) is that they have created, encouraged, even stoked, division between people, between communities, between countries.\nSurely one of the most important functions of leadership – true for managing a department or even being a parent, as well as in politics – is to reduce suspicion and hostility, to build trust, to try to bring people together in a common vision? Obviously simplistic nationalism isn’t what I mean (such as Modi’s BJP in India), but a common vision that everybody, if possible, can see the point of and feel that they or their children and friends might find good in wellbeing if not in material wealth.\nFebruary 12th 2024: The general mood right now for most people seems to be ‘Anything but this!’ For many, that means voting for the candidate most likely to unseat a Conservative, even if that individual has behaved (mostly) honourably. For many others, it means ‘I’m not voting for them, nor for any of the others!’. This is not a healthy situation.\nKeir Starmer is evidently a cautious person. He’s very conscious of what happened in 1992, when Labour had a fair lead in the polls, yet John Major and the Conservatives won. The margin in the polls is far larger now, but he clearly doesn’t want to take things for granted, and also doesn’t want to promise what he can’t deliver, in case he leads a one-term government.\nHowever, it would be good to have more of a sense of vision and hope, instead of dull competence, even though that’s what’s more important in getting our society back on track as a functioning and civil country. He no doubts wants to be radical on the climate too, but has managed to give a very confused message on that. If the markets can accept Labour’s initial plans and track record, I really hope he’ll revive that necessary huge investment before long.\nBut I can’t pretend that a majority Labour government is my preferred option. I’d like the Lib Dems to get 30-50 seats, return to being the third largest party (2nd largest is too much to hope, I think), and have a real share in decision-making. Let’s see.\nAugust 4th: Why does our Government continue to do things that seem irrational and counter-productive? Why not join the Horizon programme? Why license new oil and gas fields? Why announce that shoplifters will go to jail? Why don’t they seem to care about sewage in our rivers, and doctors and teachers leaving their professions in huge numbers, or whether we are taken seriously by our international partners? Are they stupid? Are their advisers all stupid too? Are their civil-servants not pointing out the ineffectiveness (at best) of these disjointed, erratic and naive policties?\nIs it just that it makes more profit for their rich mates? I think not. No doubt they are so used to spending time with other privileged people that their judgement is affected. We’re all more inclined to trust those like us, our friends and those of a type we know. We flatter ourselves that we understand them and they us, that they are more likely to deliver what we intend than anonymous corporations. This surely underlies to a large extent the system of patronage over the years in promotions etc. Not all purely selfish, but also unconscious bias.\nBut there is another, quite different, rationale. In 2019, Johnson perceived that UKIP might contest many existing Conservative seats, and others he hoped to win, not by winning them, but by splitting the conservative vote. He tacked to the right, and UKIP stood down in all seats held by Conservatives that supported Brexit.\nFor the 2024 General Election, the Conservatives must surely know that they’re likely to lose, and by a substantial margin. They could easily drop to 200 seats (as Labour has now). But if Reform (ex-UKIP) contests many seats, that 200 could instead be 50-100 – a near wipe-out for the party. That’s what terrifies the Conservative Party. If they try to appear more moderate, they might regain some votes from the centre-ground, but they might lose far more seats through that split vote.\nI think our inept, unimaginative and corrupt government has realised it’s going to lose badly next year, and its strategy is to avoid a wipe-out. I really find it hard to believe there’s any other rationale for continuing to adopt such stupid policies.\nJune 19th: A day to remember – the House of Commons debating the Privileges Committee report into Boris Johnson’s deliberate misleading of the House, and his subsequent rubbishing of the process and the individuals bravely producing the report. A bad day – that it was necessary, and that many Conservative MPs stayed away (very few opposed the report). A good day – that the HoC could be honest about the shenanigans of Johnson’s regime and his personal unsuitability to be Prime Minister.\nAnd, this week, a ‘stolen’ video displaying the carelessness and contempt for the public and for shared mores as Shaun Bailey’s Mayoral team at CCHQ partied on the same day we were instructed to return to social restrictions.\nHonesty in politicians means avoiding deliberate untruths or grossly misleading statements, as a minimum, but also means not promising things that there is no realistic chance of delivering. One shortlisted candidate for the expanded North-East Mayor says they’ll ‘eliminate child poverty’ – a laudable but impossible aim. They should really say ‘reducing child poverty is my principal aim’ and perhaps ‘we should be able to eliminate child poverty, and I’ll do my best to reduce it substantially in my five year term’.\nIt’s generally understood that Cameron promised a referendum that he thought he’d be forced to drop in a hung parliament, that Clegg promised no student fee increase as he didn’t expect to be in power, and that Johnson urged a Brexit that he didn’t believe in. Only the last was a complete falsehood, but the others were rash at least, and came back to haunt us all.\nMay 2nd: I get on fine with reasonable members of major parties, Labour, Conservative, Green (I don’t meet many SNP members, but probably them too). I do not get on with those who hold dogmatic positions, defying logic, ignoring facts, being insulting to others.\nPeople should vote quite separately for local and parliamentary elections, as the issues are often different and the individuals too. A local council might be doing well despite being the same party as a bad government, or vice versa. Of course there’s going to be some overlap – local parties and national parties are likely to have related priorities and assumptions about the mix of private and public, individual and state, both with respect to responsibilities and to economic mechanisms. But I respect those who vote for an excellent candidate even where that party isn’t their ‘usual’ one.\nHowever, at present this Government is so bad, so dishonest, so incompetent, that I’d rather they got a clear signal this week that it’s time for them to acknowledge defeat and give way to others with energy, ideas and integrity.\nFebruary 14th: I’m often accused of being too charitable to those who seem corrupt or crazy. Perhaps I am. But my experience is that people are often less corrupt and/or less crazy than they first appear. Moreover, in the case of politics, those who vote for what seem stupid or malign policies are unlikely to be convinced by our viewing those representatives in the worst possible light. So this is an attempt to ‘defend’ a significant minority of Conservative MPs who continue to vote with the Government even though they seem decent enough as people. This is not any defence of the policies, nor a full justification for their continuing support.\nTraditional, one-nation Conservatism, and moderate, democratic Socialism, can have constructive discussions with each other, with a fair amount of consensus on what’s acceptable both to the public and in parliamentary processes. They also agree that change must happen gradually.\nThey agree on a mixed economy, but disagree about the mix, the balance between public and private finance, and between individual and collective responsibility.\nThe Cabinet (most of them) must know that Brexit has been hugely damaging, that leaving the ECHR would be insane, that scrapping EU laws without discussion or replacement would be disastrous. The only (sane) reason for these proposals at all is that they know they’re going to lose the next General Election, badly, but think their only hope of avoiding huge losses (resulting in < 100 seats?) is to keep sufficient core voters who might support Reform. Any attempt to appeal to swing Con/Lab or Con/LD voters could cost far more than it would gain.\nMeanwhile, the ‘sensible’ Conservative MPs want their party to regain its pragmatism and caution. They know they’ll lose many seats at the next General Election, but hope that they can retain enough to form a substantial Opposition, and then re-form a parliamentary group capable of governing. But if they rebel now, they might fail to prevent whatever policy it is, create even more of an impression of incompetence, and feed the populist appetite leaking votes to Reform. They might also be de-selected (as in 2019). Thus they continue to conform, hoping to keep their own seats and a future, sensible Party.\nSome Ministers might feel similarly, though they’re deeper in the collective insanity of making enemies, damaging trade, reducing Britain’s influence, weakening our universities, etc. But maybe a few (like one or two of Trump’s lieutenants?) think that the UK would be even worse off without their moderating voice in Cabinet.\nOf course, I might be wrong. Many MPs are just in the habit of voting with their own Government, and fearful of losing their seats, even if they’re not personally corrupt.\nNovember 16th: Common UK views have moved from ‘In God we trust’ through ‘With Truss, “Oh my God!”‘ to a weary fatalism now Rishi Sunak holds the reins – ‘God knows what’s coming next!’.\nBack in the Spring, Sunak’s wife’s non-dom status became known, and by chance I was interviewed in his constituency of Richmond as if I were a resident (but I did tell ITV!). The comments after this clip are hilarious! It got extra coverage when re-tweeted by a member of the Shadow Cabinet!\nI haven’t changed my views since the early days of ‘Dishy Rishi’, when I said we knew nothing about his vision or skills – now both clearly lacking – although he does seem more decent and a bit more honest than some of his colleagues. HIs judgement though – Braverman and Williamson and Raab. How long can he last?\nOctober 18th: What a summer! My last entry, on 18th July, ended with this: “Whoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.”\nWell, our new PM got no ‘bounce’ at all, but maybe at least isn’t an inveterate liar. In fact, she tried to enact roughly what she promised to those few Conservative members, whereas most of us assumed she’d be more moderate in practice once she’d got the job! She did indeed ‘adopt really stupid policies’, but perhaps not primarily to get populist approval but because she’d fallen hook, line and sinker for ‘Minfordnomics’.\nPatrick Minford argued that Brexit would benefit the UK, but was quite open about his view that it would lead to decline in UK farming and industry. I think his logic was, if it can be produced more cheaply elsewhere, let that happen, whilst we do what we’re best at. This of course ignores the fact that much of our trade was with Europe, now more difficult and costly. It also ignores the security of home production (very obvious now with increased conflict) and the dignity and pride of things done at home. Moreover, this ‘purely logical’ approach to economics is of the kind that argues full employment can be achieved if the wage levels are appropriate, ignoring the fact that those levels might be below starvation level.\nHunt has his limitations, but is more mature and able than the PMs and chancellors we’ve had for some years. I hope he can save the UK from misery, but I also hope the Conservatives lose lots of seats at a General Election soon and learn from that!\nJuly 18th: Boris Johnson got rid of most of the most talented moderates in his parliamentary party, demanding all candidates in 2019 and all MPs since should show total loyalty to him and the Brexit project. That meant many, less courageous, MPs swallowing their pride and principles to defend the indefensible, such as lies about ‘forty new hospitals’ and ‘Northern Ireland’s economy lagging behind the rest of Britain’, trashing our reputation for integrity and reliability, and adopting populist but ineffective policies such as increased prison sentences and the appalling Rwanda policy.\nFinally forced out by his dishonesty and irresponsibility over ‘Partygate’ and the Pincher affair, Johnson leaves behind a sorry state of both UK policy and economy, and of possible successors. The debates on TV, in the press and on Twitter have brought us little honesty, few ideas, and much mud-slinging about the candidates’ own involvement and about each other. The third TV debate has been cancelled as two leading candidates could see these pubic viewings were just making them all look bad. Recall that Johnson refused to participate in all but one TV debate in 2019 and also swerved the hardest interview experienced by the other leaders in the 2019 General Election.\nWhoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.\nJune 21st: Rail strikes today, and the Government tries to blame this on Labour, who haven’t been in power for twelve years! It’s very probable that the unions have been obstructive to new practices in some ways, and certain that the railways must find economies as fewer people commute. Nonetheless, rail companies make large profits at public expense, and it probably suits the Government to milk the situation to get a few more votes in the by-elections this week.\nThe ‘Boris tried to get his lover a job’ story is very curious. Trying to suppress an almost certainly true story seems pointless, but is probably a panic reaction, calculating that some core Tory voters in Tiverton and Honiton are more likely to be influenced by paper copies of their favourite newspapers than by the commentary. Why would the Times and Mail withdraw the story? What have they been promised? Is Johnson seriously considering a General Election once the by-election results are known, and in that case, has he offered the Times and Mail an exclusive?\nI’m an optimist, but the country does seem to be out of control at present. I don’t envy any new government trying to address so many difficulties – inflation, staff shortages, trade, Northern Ireland, the pandemic, Ukraine, but building trust and cooperation must be at the centre of any programme of government right now, and at any time. Labour isn’t to blame for most of the current crop of problems, but they do need some courage in projecting a vision that’s positive for people.

There are lots of people arguing, and ‘scientists’ are quoted, though many are not epidemiologists. It seems to me that assumptions are being made by all sides. I think the UK policy is roughly this:\n- It’s likely that almost everyone will get this virus sooner or later, within the next year before any reliable vaccine is available. In any case, a vaccine might be only partially effective (like all flu jabs), as the virus could mutate.\n- More testing won’t necessarily achieve anything as such, if 1. is correct.\n- If so, then how can the peak be lowered and timed to allow best management by the NHS? Answer: by accepting a growing number of cases, whilst minimising effects on the most vulnerable.\n- Banning gatherings at an early stage might just postpone the peak, or be unsustainable and make it harder later. Closing schools in particular could lead to a greater shortage of medical and emergency personnel.\n- Things that affect economic activity will have other effects, including poverty and hence other health problems.\nWhat’s wrong with all this? Well, the point about general infection and vaccines might well be true, but time to build up equipment (ventilators) and expertise will reduce deaths. We don’t know to what extent that’s been considered (but a relative of mine in France is getting a novel treatment, so knowledge will increase).\nIf a good vaccine can be developed in a year or so, then maybe stricter restrictions that reduce overall infection rates would be worth the social costs, but we won’t know for months yet. Vaccine development might in any case be slower than this.\nAssumption 1. is key. WHO policy, that many think should be followed here, is based, I think, on the different assumption that overall infection rates can be held at a lower level and the disease eradicated or prevented by vaccination. That was clearly appropriate for Ebola.\nWhere our Government is clearly in the wrong is, firstly, that intensive care beds are at a low level, and there are significant shortages of nurses – they are responsible for that over the past ten years. Brexit policy is likely to make staff shortages much worse. And secondly, they could have ordered more ventilators weeks earlier – that alone might save lives.",

There’s always been rumours, and wild statements made to mates in the pub, but social media spreads those like wild-fire, and it’s impossible to retract a rumour. Some Conservative politicians and commentators, and some from Labour too, have tried to argue that the riots were protests about ‘legitimate concerns’, and even tried to draw parallels with the pro-Gaza and climate protests, but those were predominantly peaceful and even the more extreme elements kept to verbal attacks in almost all cases. These were riots, led by thugs, and incited by some who want chaos and hate democracy.\nHowever, it’s also clear that poverty, poor or non-existent housing, long waiting lists, etc. have given many people a feeling of being ignored and neglected, and that probably contributed to the larger numbers giving tacit encouragement to those with a violent agenda. Again, those grievances have been amplified by some who have contributed to the problems now being articulated, ironically under a new Labour government that’s far more likely to address these.\nI’m not a paid-up Starmer supporter, but it’s absurd to label him a failure after a month of the new regime. Yes, he’s already made some mistakes, but he’s clearly more honest, more competent, more serious than his several predecessors, and it’s only fair to suspend judgement until he’d had a few months to demonstrate what his priorities really are.

This is an ambitious set of policies that are all possible – fully costed and not a spending spree like the Conservatives. They used to be the party of financial prudence, but seem to have fallen for the ‘magic money tree’ concept they previously ridiculed. In any case, it’s hard to believe anything said by this Prime Minister, who was twice sacked for lying in his newspaper articles. His most important lie just now is that it was Parliament who blocked Brexit and forced the General Election. In fact, it was firstly the ERG and DUP (and Johnson himself) not accepting Theresa May’s proposals (bad, but better than his own), and then Johnson not allowing Parliament time to scrutinise the amended proposals.\nOn reflection, the policies I proposed on this site when standing for Mayor of the ‘North of Tyne’ still largely apply to what’s needed in this region, but I’m very happy to embrace those in the national manifesto. Those include (apart from stopping Brexit!): ambitious plans to address the Climate Emergency, help schools and childcare, address the social care crisis, and invest in infrastructure including in the North. See also the BBC commentary, around 1pm today, from:\n“The Liberal Democrat manifesto is out. I’ve read it! This thread gives a northern take on it, so I’ve picked the bits that I think have the most regional relevance. Overall there is an emphasis on increased regional investment, and more powers and resources for councils…” and follow the whole thread.\nTeamwork in Berwick\nSun 17th: North Tyneside members set off for Lynemouth and Linton in Northumberland, not far from Ashington, to deliver leaflets on behalf of Tom Hancock and our Berwick constituency team. Berwick was held by Alan Beith (now Lord Beith) for forty years and he is fondly remembered there, but we lost the seat in 2015 as the Party was punished for (mostly) the austerity imposed by the Conservative government. With an arch-Brexiteer Tory MP there, we’re attracting lots of support from those who understand just how bad Brexit would be for this rural constituency, as well as the rest of the North-East.\nA local candidate\nFriday 15th: I live in Whitley Bay, and I’ve lived in North Tyneside for eleven of the last thirteen years. The Labour MP and the Conservative candidate for Tynemouth also live in this constituency, and the Green candidate lives not far away and is locally active. But the Brexit candidate gives a home address in Australia! Does he have any interest at all in this area (he claims to have visited Tynemouth once)? It seems all of a pattern with another Brexit member, one of our MEPs, who lives in the South of France. They claim to care about Britain, but really! NB This featured on Tyne Tees news the same night!\nThe Race is on!\nNovember 15th: Phew! My nomination papers were formally accepted yesterday, so I’m officially the Liberal Democrat candidate for Tynemouth constituency (for the third time, also standing here in 2010 and 2017). It’s always a bit tense, getting ten local people to sign (to say I’m honest and suitable) and many more bits of paper that must conform to the legal requirements. Not to mention the £500 deposit that we get back if we get over 5% of the vote. On recent polls, I’m very hopeful of much better than that! Chris Boyle (legal aid solicitor, former Newcastle Councillor like me) will be our candidate for the North Tyneside seat (confusingly having the same name as the overall borough!).\nThings starting to happen (and to go wrong!)\nWeds 6th November: Stop Brexit! Build a Better Future. This is the Lib Dem main message in this critical election. Brexit will, in any form, damage our economy, our influence, our international standing, our voice and effect in tackling climate change and in standing up to the mega-economies of the US and China. Our electric ‘battle bus’ is a metaphor for this.\nThe Conservatives are already in damage-limitation mode. In 24 hours they have:\n- been strongly criticised for blocking publication of a report into Russian interference in our elections\n- been stopped from using the Civil Service to attack the Opposition\n- been told their Universal Credit adverts are misleading\n- had to apologise for insensitive remarks about Grenfell\n- the Welsh Secretary has resigned over his support for a former aide\n- produced a doctored video of Sir Keir Starmer\n- compared Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin\n- gone back on a promise to give MPs a vote on extending the Transition period.\nAll that in one day!!\nHere we go! The Election is on!\n31st October. We seem to be still in the EU! No civil disorder, no ‘exploding Britain’, and no Prime Minister ‘dead in a ditch’.\nFaced with a real prospect of being bullied into accepting Boris Johnson’s bad deal without proper scrutiny, or a no-deal crash, Parliament has reluctantly agreed to a General Election on 12th December 2019. The only real advantage right now is that we stop wondering about dates and parliamentary votes, but we must instead worry about how to get a sensible parliament and government to get us out of the horrible mess started by Cameron, made worse by May, worse again by Johnson, and with an ineffective Opposition. whether or not you agree with Lib Dem policies, at least we have been clear and consistent from the start!\nComing down\nOn Friday 3rd May Jamie Driscoll became the first Elected Mayor of North of Tyne. I wish him well, and hope he can work collaboratively with the three council leaders and the NELEP. His ambitious socialist programme will probably have to be scaled down a lot to fit what’s possible, what’s an allowable use of the funding, and to be agreeable to his cabinet partners.\nI got 13% of the first-choice votes – not bad in a contest that also had a credible Independent candidate (who will have picked up much of the ‘neither of them’ vote). Over 23,000 people gave me their vote, and there were lots and lots of second choice votes for me too (people whose first choice was for the Independent or for Labour), so who knows what might have happened in a three-way contest! The campaign gave me a chance to put forward my realistic vision of what was possible, and to offer myself as an experienced and collaborative pragmatist. As usual, I was happy to commend people and policies from other parties where appropriate, whilst telling them, and the voters, when I thought they were wrong or unrealistic.\nThanks to all those who voted for me, and of course to my agent and the rest of the team who encouraged, funded, leafletted, consoled. But of course, a great day for Liberal Democrat councillors across the UK, with over 700 seats gained, including Gareth Kane in Ouseburn ward, Newcastle.\nNow for some relaxation, and to catch up with my teaching work at Newcastle University (mostly marking of coursework and exams for the next month!). And my wife (who nearly tripled her vote in the local elections in North Tyneside) will be glad to hear less of politics at all hours.\nPanel beating?\nApril 29th: Thursday saw the screening of both the BBC ‘Mastermind’ quiz and the ITV ‘quick-fire’ interviews. I scored 6 on the quiz – not too bad considering I was asked the area of the NoT (my answer: 3,000 sq.m., correct answer 2,000 sq.m.) and the meaning of ‘clamming’ (Geordie: means hungry). The ITV format worked quite well and I kept to time – strictly 20 seconds or 30 on each question.\nYou can see the ITV interviews in ‘Around the House’. https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2019-04-25/a-job-interview-for-the-north-of-tyne-mayoral-candidates-plus-extinction-rebellion-effective-or-just-disruptive/\nOn Friday all five of us were recorded at the BBC studios, screened on Sunday as the Politics Show. I don’t think I have the best ‘TV manner’ of the five candidates, but feel I came across as thoughtful and knowledgeable about detail. The Labour candidate set out his ambitious plans and was challenged on the realism of those. Did you see the programme? What did you think?\nAt the Environment hustings last Tuesday, Biodiversity was raised as an issue. As I said at the time, the dramatic fall in insect numbers (owing to chemical use and climate) threatens world food supplies, and reduced plant diversity could also make new drug discovery difficult.\nClimate Emergency?\nApril 24th: Feeling tired today after four fixtures yesterday – BBC Radio, BBC TV, Chronicle/Journal hustings, then a hustings in Alnwick. The evening fixture was organised by Friends of the Earth and was focussed on the Environment – a subject I’ve featured and emphasised whenever I can in this campaign.\nSome good questions included our support for declaring a Climate Emergency in line with the street protests and the amazing Greta Thunberg. I supported this call, as it’s such a massive issue and we should be grateful to young people in particular for insisting action is taken now. But I said, to audience agreement, that declarations aren’t much use unless we all take action, including examining our own lifestyles and sacrifices we might need to make. I already do what I can (I don’t own a car, buy second-hand and rarely fly) but maybe there’s more? Perhaps I could aim to eat only seasonal food to avoid heating, cooling and transport costs?\nAnother important issue raised was Biodiversity – important for the richness of our environment, for insect pollination, and for sources for new drugs.",

Students may register at home and away but use only one vote at a General Election. Choose the one where your vote makes the most difference (might need to be a postal vote)!\nCategory: Uncategorized\nManifestly sensible!\nWeds 20th: The Liberal Democrat Manifesto has been published today – see: http://www.libdems.org.uk/plan . This is an ambitious set of policies that are all possible – fully costed and not a spending spree like the Conservatives. They used to be the party of financial prudence, but seem to have fallen for the ‘magic money tree’ concept they previously ridiculed. In any case, it’s hard to believe anything said by this Prime Minister, who was twice sacked for lying in his newspaper articles. His most important lie just now is that it was Parliament who blocked Brexit and forced the General Election. In fact, it was firstly the ERG and DUP (and Johnson himself) not accepting Theresa May’s proposals (bad, but better than his own), and then Johnson not allowing Parliament time to scrutinise the amended proposals.\nOn reflection, the policies I proposed on this site when standing for Mayor of the ‘North of Tyne’ still largely apply to what’s needed in this region, but I’m very happy to embrace those in the national manifesto. Those include (apart from stopping Brexit!): ambitious plans to address the Climate Emergency, help schools and childcare, address the social care crisis, and invest in infrastructure including in the North. See also the BBC commentary, around 1pm today, from:\n“The Liberal Democrat manifesto is out. I’ve read it! This thread gives a northern take on it, so I’ve picked the bits that I think have the most regional relevance. Overall there is an emphasis on increased regional investment, and more powers and resources for councils…” and follow the whole thread.\nTeamwork in Berwick\nSun 17th: North Tyneside members set off for Lynemouth and Linton in Northumberland, not far from Ashington, to deliver leaflets on behalf of Tom Hancock and our Berwick constituency team. Berwick was held by Alan Beith (now Lord Beith) for forty years and he is fondly remembered there, but we lost the seat in 2015 as the Party was punished for (mostly) the austerity imposed by the Conservative government. With an arch-Brexiteer Tory MP there, we’re attracting lots of support from those who understand just how bad Brexit would be for this rural constituency, as well as the rest of the North-East.\nA local candidate\nFriday 15th: I live in Whitley Bay, and I’ve lived in North Tyneside for eleven of the last thirteen years. The Labour MP and the Conservative candidate for Tynemouth also live in this constituency, and the Green candidate lives not far away and is locally active. But the Brexit candidate gives a home address in Australia! Does he have any interest at all in this area (he claims to have visited Tynemouth once)? It seems all of a pattern with another Brexit member, one of our MEPs, who lives in the South of France. They claim to care about Britain, but really! NB This featured on Tyne Tees news the same night!\nThe Race is on!\nNovember 15th: Phew! My nomination papers were formally accepted yesterday, so I’m officially the Liberal Democrat candidate for Tynemouth constituency (for the third time, also standing here in 2010 and 2017). It’s always a bit tense, getting ten local people to sign (to say I’m honest and suitable) and many more bits of paper that must conform to the legal requirements. Not to mention the £500 deposit that we get back if we get over 5% of the vote. On recent polls, I’m very hopeful of much better than that! Chris Boyle (legal aid solicitor, former Newcastle Councillor like me) will be our candidate for the North Tyneside seat (confusingly having the same name as the overall borough!).\nThings starting to happen (and to go wrong!)\nWeds 6th November: Stop Brexit! Build a Better Future. This is the Lib Dem main message in this critical election. Brexit will, in any form, damage our economy, our influence, our international standing, our voice and effect in tackling climate change and in standing up to the mega-economies of the US and China. Our electric ‘battle bus’ is a metaphor for this.\nThe Conservatives are already in damage-limitation mode. In 24 hours they have:\n- been strongly criticised for blocking publication of a report into Russian interference in our elections\n- been stopped from using the Civil Service to attack the Opposition\n- been told their Universal Credit adverts are misleading\n- had to apologise for insensitive remarks about Grenfell\n- the Welsh Secretary has resigned over his support for a former aide\n- produced a doctored video of Sir Keir Starmer\n- compared Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin\n- gone back on a promise to give MPs a vote on extending the Transition period.\nAll that in one day!!\nHere we go! The Election is on!\n31st October. We seem to be still in the EU! No civil disorder, no ‘exploding Britain’, and no Prime Minister ‘dead in a ditch’.\nFaced with a real prospect of being bullied into accepting Boris Johnson’s bad deal without proper scrutiny, or a no-deal crash, Parliament has reluctantly agreed to a General Election on 12th December 2019. The only real advantage right now is that we stop wondering about dates and parliamentary votes, but we must instead worry about how to get a sensible parliament and government to get us out of the horrible mess started by Cameron, made worse by May, worse again by Johnson, and with an ineffective Opposition. whether or not you agree with Lib Dem policies, at least we have been clear and consistent from the start!\nComing down\nOn Friday 3rd May Jamie Driscoll became the first Elected Mayor of North of Tyne. I wish him well, and hope he can work collaboratively with the three council leaders and the NELEP. His ambitious socialist programme will probably have to be scaled down a lot to fit what’s possible, what’s an allowable use of the funding, and to be agreeable to his cabinet partners.\nI got 13% of the first-choice votes – not bad in a contest that also had a credible Independent candidate (who will have picked up much of the ‘neither of them’ vote). Over 23,000 people gave me their vote, and there were lots and lots of second choice votes for me too (people whose first choice was for the Independent or for Labour), so who knows what might have happened in a three-way contest! The campaign gave me a chance to put forward my realistic vision of what was possible, and to offer myself as an experienced and collaborative pragmatist. As usual, I was happy to commend people and policies from other parties where appropriate, whilst telling them, and the voters, when I thought they were wrong or unrealistic.\nThanks to all those who voted for me, and of course to my agent and the rest of the team who encouraged, funded, leafletted, consoled. But of course, a great day for Liberal Democrat councillors across the UK, with over 700 seats gained, including Gareth Kane in Ouseburn ward, Newcastle.\nNow for some relaxation, and to catch up with my teaching work at Newcastle University (mostly marking of coursework and exams for the next month!). And my wife (who nearly tripled her vote in the local elections in North Tyneside) will be glad to hear less of politics at all hours.\nPanel beating?\nApril 29th: Thursday saw the screening of both the BBC ‘Mastermind’ quiz and the ITV ‘quick-fire’ interviews. I scored 6 on the quiz – not too bad considering I was asked the area of the NoT (my answer: 3,000 sq.m., correct answer 2,000 sq.m.) and the meaning of ‘clamming’ (Geordie: means hungry). The ITV format worked quite well and I kept to time – strictly 20 seconds or 30 on each question.\nYou can see the ITV interviews in ‘Around the House’. https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2019-04-25/a-job-interview-for-the-north-of-tyne-mayoral-candidates-plus-extinction-rebellion-effective-or-just-disruptive/\nOn Friday all five of us were recorded at the BBC studios, screened on Sunday as the Politics Show. I don’t think I have the best ‘TV manner’ of the five candidates, but feel I came across as thoughtful and knowledgeable about detail. The Labour candidate set out his ambitious plans and was challenged on the realism of those. Did you see the programme? What did you think?\nAt the Environment hustings last Tuesday, Biodiversity was raised as an issue. As I said at the time, the dramatic fall in insect numbers (owing to chemical use and climate) threatens world food supplies, and reduced plant diversity could also make new drug discovery difficult.\nClimate Emergency?\nApril 24th: Feeling tired today after four fixtures yesterday – BBC Radio, BBC TV, Chronicle/Journal hustings, then a hustings in Alnwick.

I’ve said before that the thing I have most hated about the Governments we’ve had since 2016 (i.e. Johnson, May, Truss, Sunak) is that they have created, encouraged, even stoked, division between people, between communities, between countries.\nSurely one of the most important functions of leadership – true for managing a department or even being a parent, as well as in politics – is to reduce suspicion and hostility, to build trust, to try to bring people together in a common vision? Obviously simplistic nationalism isn’t what I mean (such as Modi’s BJP in India), but a common vision that everybody, if possible, can see the point of and feel that they or their children and friends might find good in wellbeing if not in material wealth.\nFebruary 12th 2024: The general mood right now for most people seems to be ‘Anything but this!’ For many, that means voting for the candidate most likely to unseat a Conservative, even if that individual has behaved (mostly) honourably. For many others, it means ‘I’m not voting for them, nor for any of the others!’. This is not a healthy situation.\nKeir Starmer is evidently a cautious person. He’s very conscious of what happened in 1992, when Labour had a fair lead in the polls, yet John Major and the Conservatives won. The margin in the polls is far larger now, but he clearly doesn’t want to take things for granted, and also doesn’t want to promise what he can’t deliver, in case he leads a one-term government.\nHowever, it would be good to have more of a sense of vision and hope, instead of dull competence, even though that’s what’s more important in getting our society back on track as a functioning and civil country. He no doubts wants to be radical on the climate too, but has managed to give a very confused message on that. If the markets can accept Labour’s initial plans and track record, I really hope he’ll revive that necessary huge investment before long.\nBut I can’t pretend that a majority Labour government is my preferred option. I’d like the Lib Dems to get 30-50 seats, return to being the third largest party (2nd largest is too much to hope, I think), and have a real share in decision-making. Let’s see.\nAugust 4th: Why does our Government continue to do things that seem irrational and counter-productive? Why not join the Horizon programme? Why license new oil and gas fields? Why announce that shoplifters will go to jail? Why don’t they seem to care about sewage in our rivers, and doctors and teachers leaving their professions in huge numbers, or whether we are taken seriously by our international partners? Are they stupid? Are their advisers all stupid too? Are their civil-servants not pointing out the ineffectiveness (at best) of these disjointed, erratic and naive policties?\nIs it just that it makes more profit for their rich mates? I think not. No doubt they are so used to spending time with other privileged people that their judgement is affected. We’re all more inclined to trust those like us, our friends and those of a type we know. We flatter ourselves that we understand them and they us, that they are more likely to deliver what we intend than anonymous corporations. This surely underlies to a large extent the system of patronage over the years in promotions etc. Not all purely selfish, but also unconscious bias.\nBut there is another, quite different, rationale. In 2019, Johnson perceived that UKIP might contest many existing Conservative seats, and others he hoped to win, not by winning them, but by splitting the conservative vote. He tacked to the right, and UKIP stood down in all seats held by Conservatives that supported Brexit.\nFor the 2024 General Election, the Conservatives must surely know that they’re likely to lose, and by a substantial margin. They could easily drop to 200 seats (as Labour has now). But if Reform (ex-UKIP) contests many seats, that 200 could instead be 50-100 – a near wipe-out for the party. That’s what terrifies the Conservative Party. If they try to appear more moderate, they might regain some votes from the centre-ground, but they might lose far more seats through that split vote.\nI think our inept, unimaginative and corrupt government has realised it’s going to lose badly next year, and its strategy is to avoid a wipe-out. I really find it hard to believe there’s any other rationale for continuing to adopt such stupid policies.\nJune 19th: A day to remember – the House of Commons debating the Privileges Committee report into Boris Johnson’s deliberate misleading of the House, and his subsequent rubbishing of the process and the individuals bravely producing the report. A bad day – that it was necessary, and that many Conservative MPs stayed away (very few opposed the report). A good day – that the HoC could be honest about the shenanigans of Johnson’s regime and his personal unsuitability to be Prime Minister.\nAnd, this week, a ‘stolen’ video displaying the carelessness and contempt for the public and for shared mores as Shaun Bailey’s Mayoral team at CCHQ partied on the same day we were instructed to return to social restrictions.\nHonesty in politicians means avoiding deliberate untruths or grossly misleading statements, as a minimum, but also means not promising things that there is no realistic chance of delivering. One shortlisted candidate for the expanded North-East Mayor says they’ll ‘eliminate child poverty’ – a laudable but impossible aim. They should really say ‘reducing child poverty is my principal aim’ and perhaps ‘we should be able to eliminate child poverty, and I’ll do my best to reduce it substantially in my five year term’.\nIt’s generally understood that Cameron promised a referendum that he thought he’d be forced to drop in a hung parliament, that Clegg promised no student fee increase as he didn’t expect to be in power, and that Johnson urged a Brexit that he didn’t believe in. Only the last was a complete falsehood, but the others were rash at least, and came back to haunt us all.\nMay 2nd: I get on fine with reasonable members of major parties, Labour, Conservative, Green (I don’t meet many SNP members, but probably them too). I do not get on with those who hold dogmatic positions, defying logic, ignoring facts, being insulting to others.\nPeople should vote quite separately for local and parliamentary elections, as the issues are often different and the individuals too. A local council might be doing well despite being the same party as a bad government, or vice versa. Of course there’s going to be some overlap – local parties and national parties are likely to have related priorities and assumptions about the mix of private and public, individual and state, both with respect to responsibilities and to economic mechanisms. But I respect those who vote for an excellent candidate even where that party isn’t their ‘usual’ one.\nHowever, at present this Government is so bad, so dishonest, so incompetent, that I’d rather they got a clear signal this week that it’s time for them to acknowledge defeat and give way to others with energy, ideas and integrity.\nFebruary 14th: I’m often accused of being too charitable to those who seem corrupt or crazy. Perhaps I am. But my experience is that people are often less corrupt and/or less crazy than they first appear. Moreover, in the case of politics, those who vote for what seem stupid or malign policies are unlikely to be convinced by our viewing those representatives in the worst possible light. So this is an attempt to ‘defend’ a significant minority of Conservative MPs who continue to vote with the Government even though they seem decent enough as people. This is not any defence of the policies, nor a full justification for their continuing support.\nTraditional, one-nation Conservatism, and moderate, democratic Socialism, can have constructive discussions with each other, with a fair amount of consensus on what’s acceptable both to the public and in parliamentary processes. They also agree that change must happen gradually.\nThey agree on a mixed economy, but disagree about the mix, the balance between public and private finance, and between individual and collective responsibility.\nThe Cabinet (most of them) must know that Brexit has been hugely damaging, that leaving the ECHR would be insane, that scrapping EU laws without discussion or replacement would be disastrous. The only (sane) reason for these proposals at all is that they know they’re going to lose the next General Election, badly, but think their only hope of avoiding huge losses (resulting in < 100 seats?) is to keep sufficient core voters who might support Reform. Any attempt to appeal to swing Con/Lab or Con/LD voters could cost far more than it would gain.\nMeanwhile, the ‘sensible’ Conservative MPs want their party to regain its pragmatism and caution. They know they’ll lose many seats at the next General Election, but hope that they can retain enough to form a substantial Opposition, and then re-form a parliamentary group capable of governing. But if they rebel now, they might fail to prevent whatever policy it is, create even more of an impression of incompetence, and feed the populist appetite leaking votes to Reform. They might also be de-selected (as in 2019). Thus they continue to conform, hoping to keep their own seats and a future, sensible Party.\nSome Ministers might feel similarly, though they’re deeper in the collective insanity of making enemies, damaging trade, reducing Britain’s influence, weakening our universities, etc. But maybe a few (like one or two of Trump’s lieutenants?) think that the UK would be even worse off without their moderating voice in Cabinet.\nOf course, I might be wrong. Many MPs are just in the habit of voting with their own Government, and fearful of losing their seats, even if they’re not personally corrupt.\nNovember 16th: Common UK views have moved from ‘In God we trust’ through ‘With Truss, “Oh my God!”‘ to a weary fatalism now Rishi Sunak holds the reins – ‘God knows what’s coming next!’.\nBack in the Spring, Sunak’s wife’s non-dom status became known, and by chance I was interviewed in his constituency of Richmond as if I were a resident (but I did tell ITV!). The comments after this clip are hilarious! It got extra coverage when re-tweeted by a member of the Shadow Cabinet!\nI haven’t changed my views since the early days of ‘Dishy Rishi’, when I said we knew nothing about his vision or skills – now both clearly lacking – although he does seem more decent and a bit more honest than some of his colleagues. HIs judgement though – Braverman and Williamson and Raab. How long can he last?\nOctober 18th: What a summer! My last entry, on 18th July, ended with this: “Whoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.”\nWell, our new PM got no ‘bounce’ at all, but maybe at least isn’t an inveterate liar. In fact, she tried to enact roughly what she promised to those few Conservative members, whereas most of us assumed she’d be more moderate in practice once she’d got the job! She did indeed ‘adopt really stupid policies’, but perhaps not primarily to get populist approval but because she’d fallen hook, line and sinker for ‘Minfordnomics’.\nPatrick Minford argued that Brexit would benefit the UK, but was quite open about his view that it would lead to decline in UK farming and industry. I think his logic was, if it can be produced more cheaply elsewhere, let that happen, whilst we do what we’re best at. This of course ignores the fact that much of our trade was with Europe, now more difficult and costly. It also ignores the security of home production (very obvious now with increased conflict) and the dignity and pride of things done at home. Moreover, this ‘purely logical’ approach to economics is of the kind that argues full employment can be achieved if the wage levels are appropriate, ignoring the fact that those levels might be below starvation level.\nHunt has his limitations, but is more mature and able than the PMs and chancellors we’ve had for some years. I hope he can save the UK from misery, but I also hope the Conservatives lose lots of seats at a General Election soon and learn from that!\nJuly 18th: Boris Johnson got rid of most of the most talented moderates in his parliamentary party, demanding all candidates in 2019 and all MPs since should show total loyalty to him and the Brexit project. That meant many, less courageous, MPs swallowing their pride and principles to defend the indefensible, such as lies about ‘forty new hospitals’ and ‘Northern Ireland’s economy lagging behind the rest of Britain’, trashing our reputation for integrity and reliability, and adopting populist but ineffective policies such as increased prison sentences and the appalling Rwanda policy.\nFinally forced out by his dishonesty and irresponsibility over ‘Partygate’ and the Pincher affair, Johnson leaves behind a sorry state of both UK policy and economy, and of possible successors. The debates on TV, in the press and on Twitter have brought us little honesty, few ideas, and much mud-slinging about the candidates’ own involvement and about each other. The third TV debate has been cancelled as two leading candidates could see these pubic viewings were just making them all look bad. Recall that Johnson refused to participate in all but one TV debate in 2019 and also swerved the hardest interview experienced by the other leaders in the 2019 General Election.\nWhoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.\nJune 21st: Rail strikes today, and the Government tries to blame this on Labour, who haven’t been in power for twelve years! It’s very probable that the unions have been obstructive to new practices in some ways, and certain that the railways must find economies as fewer people commute. Nonetheless, rail companies make large profits at public expense, and it probably suits the Government to milk the situation to get a few more votes in the by-elections this week.\nThe ‘Boris tried to get his lover a job’ story is very curious. Trying to suppress an almost certainly true story seems pointless, but is probably a panic reaction, calculating that some core Tory voters in Tiverton and Honiton are more likely to be influenced by paper copies of their favourite newspapers than by the commentary. Why would the Times and Mail withdraw the story? What have they been promised? Is Johnson seriously considering a General Election once the by-election results are known, and in that case, has he offered the Times and Mail an exclusive?\nI’m an optimist, but the country does seem to be out of control at present. I don’t envy any new government trying to address so many difficulties – inflation, staff shortages, trade, Northern Ireland, the pandemic, Ukraine, but building trust and cooperation must be at the centre of any programme of government right now, and at any time. Labour isn’t to blame for most of the current crop of problems, but they do need some courage in projecting a vision that’s positive for people. That does seem to be lacking, and if the Tories do dump Johnson and find a more decent and competent leader, it might be hard for Starmer to be seen as the better choice.",

If the markets can accept Labour’s initial plans and track record, I really hope he’ll revive that necessary huge investment before long.\nBut I can’t pretend that a majority Labour government is my preferred option. I’d like the Lib Dems to get 30-50 seats, return to being the third largest party (2nd largest is too much to hope, I think), and have a real share in decision-making. Let’s see.\nAugust 4th: Why does our Government continue to do things that seem irrational and counter-productive? Why not join the Horizon programme? Why license new oil and gas fields? Why announce that shoplifters will go to jail? Why don’t they seem to care about sewage in our rivers, and doctors and teachers leaving their professions in huge numbers, or whether we are taken seriously by our international partners? Are they stupid? Are their advisers all stupid too? Are their civil-servants not pointing out the ineffectiveness (at best) of these disjointed, erratic and naive policties?\nIs it just that it makes more profit for their rich mates? I think not. No doubt they are so used to spending time with other privileged people that their judgement is affected. We’re all more inclined to trust those like us, our friends and those of a type we know. We flatter ourselves that we understand them and they us, that they are more likely to deliver what we intend than anonymous corporations. This surely underlies to a large extent the system of patronage over the years in promotions etc. Not all purely selfish, but also unconscious bias.\nBut there is another, quite different, rationale. In 2019, Johnson perceived that UKIP might contest many existing Conservative seats, and others he hoped to win, not by winning them, but by splitting the conservative vote. He tacked to the right, and UKIP stood down in all seats held by Conservatives that supported Brexit.\nFor the 2024 General Election, the Conservatives must surely know that they’re likely to lose, and by a substantial margin. They could easily drop to 200 seats (as Labour has now). But if Reform (ex-UKIP) contests many seats, that 200 could instead be 50-100 – a near wipe-out for the party. That’s what terrifies the Conservative Party. If they try to appear more moderate, they might regain some votes from the centre-ground, but they might lose far more seats through that split vote.\nI think our inept, unimaginative and corrupt government has realised it’s going to lose badly next year, and its strategy is to avoid a wipe-out. I really find it hard to believe there’s any other rationale for continuing to adopt such stupid policies.\nJune 19th: A day to remember – the House of Commons debating the Privileges Committee report into Boris Johnson’s deliberate misleading of the House, and his subsequent rubbishing of the process and the individuals bravely producing the report. A bad day – that it was necessary, and that many Conservative MPs stayed away (very few opposed the report). A good day – that the HoC could be honest about the shenanigans of Johnson’s regime and his personal unsuitability to be Prime Minister.\nAnd, this week, a ‘stolen’ video displaying the carelessness and contempt for the public and for shared mores as Shaun Bailey’s Mayoral team at CCHQ partied on the same day we were instructed to return to social restrictions.\nHonesty in politicians means avoiding deliberate untruths or grossly misleading statements, as a minimum, but also means not promising things that there is no realistic chance of delivering. One shortlisted candidate for the expanded North-East Mayor says they’ll ‘eliminate child poverty’ – a laudable but impossible aim. They should really say ‘reducing child poverty is my principal aim’ and perhaps ‘we should be able to eliminate child poverty, and I’ll do my best to reduce it substantially in my five year term’.\nIt’s generally understood that Cameron promised a referendum that he thought he’d be forced to drop in a hung parliament, that Clegg promised no student fee increase as he didn’t expect to be in power, and that Johnson urged a Brexit that he didn’t believe in. Only the last was a complete falsehood, but the others were rash at least, and came back to haunt us all.\nMay 2nd: I get on fine with reasonable members of major parties, Labour, Conservative, Green (I don’t meet many SNP members, but probably them too). I do not get on with those who hold dogmatic positions, defying logic, ignoring facts, being insulting to others.\nPeople should vote quite separately for local and parliamentary elections, as the issues are often different and the individuals too. A local council might be doing well despite being the same party as a bad government, or vice versa. Of course there’s going to be some overlap – local parties and national parties are likely to have related priorities and assumptions about the mix of private and public, individual and state, both with respect to responsibilities and to economic mechanisms. But I respect those who vote for an excellent candidate even where that party isn’t their ‘usual’ one.\nHowever, at present this Government is so bad, so dishonest, so incompetent, that I’d rather they got a clear signal this week that it’s time for them to acknowledge defeat and give way to others with energy, ideas and integrity.\nFebruary 14th: I’m often accused of being too charitable to those who seem corrupt or crazy. Perhaps I am. But my experience is that people are often less corrupt and/or less crazy than they first appear. Moreover, in the case of politics, those who vote for what seem stupid or malign policies are unlikely to be convinced by our viewing those representatives in the worst possible light. So this is an attempt to ‘defend’ a significant minority of Conservative MPs who continue to vote with the Government even though they seem decent enough as people. This is not any defence of the policies, nor a full justification for their continuing support.\nTraditional, one-nation Conservatism, and moderate, democratic Socialism, can have constructive discussions with each other, with a fair amount of consensus on what’s acceptable both to the public and in parliamentary processes. They also agree that change must happen gradually.\nThey agree on a mixed economy, but disagree about the mix, the balance between public and private finance, and between individual and collective responsibility.\nThe Cabinet (most of them) must know that Brexit has been hugely damaging, that leaving the ECHR would be insane, that scrapping EU laws without discussion or replacement would be disastrous. The only (sane) reason for these proposals at all is that they know they’re going to lose the next General Election, badly, but think their only hope of avoiding huge losses (resulting in < 100 seats?) is to keep sufficient core voters who might support Reform. Any attempt to appeal to swing Con/Lab or Con/LD voters could cost far more than it would gain.\nMeanwhile, the ‘sensible’ Conservative MPs want their party to regain its pragmatism and caution. They know they’ll lose many seats at the next General Election, but hope that they can retain enough to form a substantial Opposition, and then re-form a parliamentary group capable of governing. But if they rebel now, they might fail to prevent whatever policy it is, create even more of an impression of incompetence, and feed the populist appetite leaking votes to Reform. They might also be de-selected (as in 2019). Thus they continue to conform, hoping to keep their own seats and a future, sensible Party.\nSome Ministers might feel similarly, though they’re deeper in the collective insanity of making enemies, damaging trade, reducing Britain’s influence, weakening our universities, etc. But maybe a few (like one or two of Trump’s lieutenants?) think that the UK would be even worse off without their moderating voice in Cabinet.\nOf course, I might be wrong. Many MPs are just in the habit of voting with their own Government, and fearful of losing their seats, even if they’re not personally corrupt.\nNovember 16th: Common UK views have moved from ‘In God we trust’ through ‘With Truss, “Oh my God!”‘ to a weary fatalism now Rishi Sunak holds the reins – ‘God knows what’s coming next!’.\nBack in the Spring, Sunak’s wife’s non-dom status became known, and by chance I was interviewed in his constituency of Richmond as if I were a resident (but I did tell ITV!). The comments after this clip are hilarious! It got extra coverage when re-tweeted by a member of the Shadow Cabinet!\nI haven’t changed my views since the early days of ‘Dishy Rishi’, when I said we knew nothing about his vision or skills – now both clearly lacking – although he does seem more decent and a bit more honest than some of his colleagues. HIs judgement though – Braverman and Williamson and Raab. How long can he last?\nOctober 18th: What a summer! My last entry, on 18th July, ended with this: “Whoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.”\nWell, our new PM got no ‘bounce’ at all, but maybe at least isn’t an inveterate liar. In fact, she tried to enact roughly what she promised to those few Conservative members, whereas most of us assumed she’d be more moderate in practice once she’d got the job! She did indeed ‘adopt really stupid policies’, but perhaps not primarily to get populist approval but because she’d fallen hook, line and sinker for ‘Minfordnomics’.\nPatrick Minford argued that Brexit would benefit the UK, but was quite open about his view that it would lead to decline in UK farming and industry. I think his logic was, if it can be produced more cheaply elsewhere, let that happen, whilst we do what we’re best at. This of course ignores the fact that much of our trade was with Europe, now more difficult and costly. It also ignores the security of home production (very obvious now with increased conflict) and the dignity and pride of things done at home. Moreover, this ‘purely logical’ approach to economics is of the kind that argues full employment can be achieved if the wage levels are appropriate, ignoring the fact that those levels might be below starvation level.\nHunt has his limitations, but is more mature and able than the PMs and chancellors we’ve had for some years. I hope he can save the UK from misery, but I also hope the Conservatives lose lots of seats at a General Election soon and learn from that!\nJuly 18th: Boris Johnson got rid of most of the most talented moderates in his parliamentary party, demanding all candidates in 2019 and all MPs since should show total loyalty to him and the Brexit project. That meant many, less courageous, MPs swallowing their pride and principles to defend the indefensible, such as lies about ‘forty new hospitals’ and ‘Northern Ireland’s economy lagging behind the rest of Britain’, trashing our reputation for integrity and reliability, and adopting populist but ineffective policies such as increased prison sentences and the appalling Rwanda policy.\nFinally forced out by his dishonesty and irresponsibility over ‘Partygate’ and the Pincher affair, Johnson leaves behind a sorry state of both UK policy and economy, and of possible successors. The debates on TV, in the press and on Twitter have brought us little honesty, few ideas, and much mud-slinging about the candidates’ own involvement and about each other. The third TV debate has been cancelled as two leading candidates could see these pubic viewings were just making them all look bad. Recall that Johnson refused to participate in all but one TV debate in 2019 and also swerved the hardest interview experienced by the other leaders in the 2019 General Election.\nWhoever is chosen might get a small ‘bounce’, and might genuinely be a bit more honest than Johnson, but it is to be hoped that currently greater trust in Keir Starmer won’t evaporate, and that our new PM won’t adopt really stupid policies, rashly hoping for some populist revival of support.\nJune 21st: Rail strikes today, and the Government tries to blame this on Labour, who haven’t been in power for twelve years! It’s very probable that the unions have been obstructive to new practices in some ways, and certain that the railways must find economies as fewer people commute. Nonetheless, rail companies make large profits at public expense, and it probably suits the Government to milk the situation to get a few more votes in the by-elections this week.\nThe ‘Boris tried to get his lover a job’ story is very curious. Trying to suppress an almost certainly true story seems pointless, but is probably a panic reaction, calculating that some core Tory voters in Tiverton and Honiton are more likely to be influenced by paper copies of their favourite newspapers than by the commentary. Why would the Times and Mail withdraw the story? What have they been promised? Is Johnson seriously considering a General Election once the by-election results are known, and in that case, has he offered the Times and Mail an exclusive?\nI’m an optimist, but the country does seem to be out of control at present. I don’t envy any new government trying to address so many difficulties – inflation, staff shortages, trade, Northern Ireland, the pandemic, Ukraine, but building trust and cooperation must be at the centre of any programme of government right now, and at any time. Labour isn’t to blame for most of the current crop of problems, but they do need some courage in projecting a vision that’s positive for people. That does seem to be lacking, and if the Tories do dump Johnson and find a more decent and competent leader, it might be hard for Starmer to be seen as the better choice.",
  "https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_/https_johnapplebyld_wordpress_com_2024_08_10_facts-and-impressions/content_23.html": "August 10th: Riots and crime for over a week, with hundreds of arrests, including some for on-line posts. There’s always been rumours, and wild statements made to mates in the pub, but social media spreads those like wild-fire, and it’s impossible to retract a rumour. Some Conservative politicians and commentators, and some from Labour too, have tried to argue that the riots were protests about ‘legitimate concerns’, and even tried to draw parallels with the pro-Gaza and climate protests, but those were predominantly peaceful and even the more extreme elements kept to verbal attacks in almost all cases. These were riots, led by thugs, and incited by some who want chaos and hate democracy.\nHowever, it’s also clear that poverty, poor or non-existent housing, long waiting lists, etc. have given many people a feeling of being ignored and neglected, and that probably contributed to the larger numbers giving tacit encouragement to those with a violent agenda. Again, those grievances have been amplified by some who have contributed to the problems now being articulated, ironically under a new Labour government that’s far more likely to address these.\nI’m not a paid-up Starmer supporter, but it’s absurd to label him a failure after a month of the new regime. Yes, he’s already made some mistakes, but he’s clearly more honest, more competent, more serious than his several predecessors, and it’s only fair to suspend judgement until he’d had a few months to demonstrate what his priorities really are. What is clear though is that people will want to see at least signs of progress on housing, waiting lists and some other costs before too long, and such signs will also help tackle the scapegoating of migrants.",

This is an ambitious set of policies that are all possible – fully costed and not a spending spree like the Conservatives. They used to be the party of financial prudence, but seem to have fallen for the ‘magic money tree’ concept they previously ridiculed. In any case, it’s hard to believe anything said by this Prime Minister, who was twice sacked for lying in his newspaper articles. His most important lie just now is that it was Parliament who blocked Brexit and forced the General Election. In fact, it was firstly the ERG and DUP (and Johnson himself) not accepting Theresa May’s proposals (bad, but better than his own), and then Johnson not allowing Parliament time to scrutinise the amended proposals.\nOn reflection, the policies I proposed on this site when standing for Mayor of the ‘North of Tyne’ still largely apply to what’s needed in this region, but I’m very happy to embrace those in the national manifesto. Those include (apart from stopping Brexit!): ambitious plans to address the Climate Emergency, help schools and childcare, address the social care crisis, and invest in infrastructure including in the North. See also the BBC commentary, around 1pm today, from:\n“The Liberal Democrat manifesto is out. I’ve read it! This thread gives a northern take on it, so I’ve picked the bits that I think have the most regional relevance. Overall there is an emphasis on increased regional investment, and more powers and resources for councils…” and follow the whole thread.\nTeamwork in Berwick\nSun 17th: North Tyneside members set off for Lynemouth and Linton in Northumberland, not far from Ashington, to deliver leaflets on behalf of Tom Hancock and our Berwick constituency team. Berwick was held by Alan Beith (now Lord Beith) for forty years and he is fondly remembered there, but we lost the seat in 2015 as the Party was punished for (mostly) the austerity imposed by the Conservative government. With an arch-Brexiteer Tory MP there, we’re attracting lots of support from those who understand just how bad Brexit would be for this rural constituency, as well as the rest of the North-East.\nA local candidate\nFriday 15th: I live in Whitley Bay, and I’ve lived in North Tyneside for eleven of the last thirteen years. The Labour MP and the Conservative candidate for Tynemouth also live in this constituency, and the Green candidate lives not far away and is locally active. But the Brexit candidate gives a home address in Australia! Does he have any interest at all in this area (he claims to have visited Tynemouth once)? It seems all of a pattern with another Brexit member, one of our MEPs, who lives in the South of France. They claim to care about Britain, but really! NB This featured on Tyne Tees news the same night!\nThe Race is on!\nNovember 15th: Phew! My nomination papers were formally accepted yesterday, so I’m officially the Liberal Democrat candidate for Tynemouth constituency (for the third time, also standing here in 2010 and 2017). It’s always a bit tense, getting ten local people to sign (to say I’m honest and suitable) and many more bits of paper that must conform to the legal requirements. Not to mention the £500 deposit that we get back if we get over 5% of the vote. On recent polls, I’m very hopeful of much better than that! Chris Boyle (legal aid solicitor, former Newcastle Councillor like me) will be our candidate for the North Tyneside seat (confusingly having the same name as the overall borough!).\nThings starting to happen (and to go wrong!)\nWeds 6th November: Stop Brexit! Build a Better Future. This is the Lib Dem main message in this critical election. Brexit will, in any form, damage our economy, our influence, our international standing, our voice and effect in tackling climate change and in standing up to the mega-economies of the US and China. Our electric ‘battle bus’ is a metaphor for this.\nThe Conservatives are already in damage-limitation mode. In 24 hours they have:\n- been strongly criticised for blocking publication of a report into Russian interference in our elections\n- been stopped from using the Civil Service to attack the Opposition\n- been told their Universal Credit adverts are misleading\n- had to apologise for insensitive remarks about Grenfell\n- the Welsh Secretary has resigned over his support for a former aide\n- produced a doctored video of Sir Keir Starmer\n- compared Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin\n- gone back on a promise to give MPs a vote on extending the Transition period.\nAll that in one day!!\nHere we go! The Election is on!\n31st October. We seem to be still in the EU! No civil disorder, no ‘exploding Britain’, and no Prime Minister ‘dead in a ditch’.\nFaced with a real prospect of being bullied into accepting Boris Johnson’s bad deal without proper scrutiny, or a no-deal crash, Parliament has reluctantly agreed to a General Election on 12th December 2019. The only real advantage right now is that we stop wondering about dates and parliamentary votes, but we must instead worry about how to get a sensible parliament and government to get us out of the horrible mess started by Cameron, made worse by May, worse again by Johnson, and with an ineffective Opposition. whether or not you agree with Lib Dem policies, at least we have been clear and consistent from the start!\nComing down\nOn Friday 3rd May Jamie Driscoll became the first Elected Mayor of North of Tyne. I wish him well, and hope he can work collaboratively with the three council leaders and the NELEP. His ambitious socialist programme will probably have to be scaled down a lot to fit what’s possible, what’s an allowable use of the funding, and to be agreeable to his cabinet partners.\nI got 13% of the first-choice votes – not bad in a contest that also had a credible Independent candidate (who will have picked up much of the ‘neither of them’ vote). Over 23,000 people gave me their vote, and there were lots and lots of second choice votes for me too (people whose first choice was for the Independent or for Labour), so who knows what might have happened in a three-way contest! The campaign gave me a chance to put forward my realistic vision of what was possible, and to offer myself as an experienced and collaborative pragmatist. As usual, I was happy to commend people and policies from other parties where appropriate, whilst telling them, and the voters, when I thought they were wrong or unrealistic.\nThanks to all those who voted for me, and of course to my agent and the rest of the team who encouraged, funded, leafletted, consoled. But of course, a great day for Liberal Democrat councillors across the UK, with over 700 seats gained, including Gareth Kane in Ouseburn ward, Newcastle.\nNow for some relaxation, and to catch up with my teaching work at Newcastle University (mostly marking of coursework and exams for the next month!). And my wife (who nearly tripled her vote in the local elections in North Tyneside) will be glad to hear less of politics at all hours.\nPanel beating?\nApril 29th: Thursday saw the screening of both the BBC ‘Mastermind’ quiz and the ITV ‘quick-fire’ interviews. I scored 6 on the quiz – not too bad considering I was asked the area of the NoT (my answer: 3,000 sq.m., correct answer 2,000 sq.m.) and the meaning of ‘clamming’ (Geordie: means hungry). The ITV format worked quite well and I kept to time – strictly 20 seconds or 30 on each question.\nYou can see the ITV interviews in ‘Around the House’. https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2019-04-25/a-job-interview-for-the-north-of-tyne-mayoral-candidates-plus-extinction-rebellion-effective-or-just-disruptive/\nOn Friday all five of us were recorded at the BBC studios, screened on Sunday as the Politics Show. I don’t think I have the best ‘TV manner’ of the five candidates, but feel I came across as thoughtful and knowledgeable about detail. The Labour candidate set out his ambitious plans and was challenged on the realism of those. Did you see the programme? What did you think?\nAt the Environment hustings last Tuesday, Biodiversity was raised as an issue. As I said at the time, the dramatic fall in insect numbers (owing to chemical use and climate) threatens world food supplies, and reduced plant diversity could also make new drug discovery difficult.\nClimate Emergency?\nApril 24th: Feeling tired today after four fixtures yesterday – BBC Radio, BBC TV, Chronicle/Journal hustings, then a hustings in Alnwick. The evening fixture was organised by Friends of the Earth and was focussed on the Environment – a subject I’ve featured and emphasised whenever I can in this campaign.\nSome good questions included our support for declaring a Climate Emergency in line with the street protests and the amazing Greta Thunberg. I supported this call, as it’s such a massive issue and we should be grateful to young people in particular for insisting action is taken now. But I said, to audience agreement, that declarations aren’t much use unless we all take action, including examining our own lifestyles and sacrifices we might need to make. I already do what I can (I don’t own a car, buy second-hand and rarely fly) but maybe there’s more? Perhaps I could aim to eat only seasonal food to avoid heating, cooling and transport costs?\nAnother important issue raised was Biodiversity – important for the richness of our environment, for insect pollination, and for sources for new drugs.",
