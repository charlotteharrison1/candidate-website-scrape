Many victims never fully feel safe again. The prosperity, security and quality of life of communities is damaged.\nAs Hertfordshire's Police & Crime Commissioner, I will work every day for an effective police force that prevents and cuts crime, catches criminals and keeps you safe.\nConservative PCCs focus on your priorities:\n- More Police – Hertfordshire now has more police officers than ever before, with over 300 more officers compared to 2019 levels.\n- Safer Streets – Hertfordshire is the 5th safest county in England & Wales and has an award winning victim care and support service.\n- Lower Tax – local residents pay one of the lowest police precepts in the country.\nAs your Police & Crime Commissioner, Jonathan will:\n- Prevent crime – disrupt criminality and invest in ‘hotspot’ policing to tackle persistent offending.\n- Tackle high impact crimes – focus on fraud and cybercrime, domestic abuse, county lines drugs gangs and violence against women and girls.\n- Ensure responsive policing – protect neighbourhood policing in every district and work for a robust response to anti-social behaviour and neighbourhood crime. Ensure home burglary gets a police response and not just a crime number.\n- Support victims – fund high quality victim support and focus on improving detection rates to ensure more victims see justice being done.\n- Keep Herts safe – ensure our county continues to be a great place to live and work, with safe town centres, rural crime tackled and a safe road network, working with local Councils and public services to drive down demand for policing.\n- Listening to you – work to ensure your voice is heard in local policing and the police are empowered to deliver on your priorities. Deliver value for money and sound financial management.\nVote for Jonathan Ash-Edwards on Thursday 2nd May.",

Therefore this site has been designed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA, but also satisfies many other checkpoints laid out in the Guidelines for level AAA.\nThese guidelines are intended to make website content accessible to people with disabilities. They also help to ensure that slower devices and Internet connections do not impede substantially on navigating the website.\nTherefore, you should be able to:-\n- Zoom in up to 300% without test spilling off the screen using your web browser settings. For example, in Chrome, hold down the ctrl key and press the + and - keys. In Safari, hold down the cmd key and press the + and - keys.\n- Navigate most of the website using a keyboard\n- Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software\n- Listen to most of the website with a screen reader\n- Read most of the website with a Braille device\nAbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have additional access needs.\nWhat we do to improve accessibility\nThe website administrator is responsible for the accessibility of this website. However, the developers regularly review design and functionality accessibility on the website platform, including:-\n- Improving layouts and colours to enhance simplicity and contrast\n- Ensuring that text appears in a legible font size\n- Ensuring that tap targets are an accessible size and not too small or close together\n- Considering accessibility in all design and functionality decisions\n- Publishing best practice for website administrators relating to content accessibility\nHow accessible is the website platform?\nDue to the devolved nature of the administration of a website platform, the responsibility for accessibility of content rests with the content creators. The developers are aware of the potential to add or modify content that is not as accessible as it could be, including:-\n- Images used as links\n- Broken links\n- Text as images in some locations, such as infographics and logos, without supportive descriptions\n- Non-optimal images and pdfs, such as scanned letters\n- Some historic images lack alternative text (prior to August 2016, when alt text became mandatory on the platform)\n- Not all videos feature subtitles and/or descriptive text\nThe developers of the website platform have no control over nor can take any responsibility for the content added to the website, but strive to resolve these where possible through aspects of the functionality as well as integral and disseminated best practice. It is entirely possible for all of these accessibility issues to be resolved by content creators themselves.\nBrowser accessibility\nThis website has been optimised for the latest versions of the following browsers:-\n- Google Chrome\n- Mozilla Firefox\n- Apple Safari\n- Microsoft Edge\nIf the website does not display correctly, please update to the latest version of your browser.\nHow to request information in an accessible format\nThis website has its own administrator and if you need information in a different format, please contact that individual using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu.

Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Jonathan Ash-Edwards, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data.

Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA).

Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.

  "https_www_jonathanashedwards_com_/https_www_jonathanashedwards_com_about-jonathan/content_8.html": "Jonathan Ash-Edwards has been selected by Hertfordshire Conservatives as their candidate for Police & Crime Commissioner on Thursday 2nd May, following the decision of David Lloyd to stand down after 12 years' service.\nThe son of a chartered accountant and teaching assistant, Jonathan wasn't born into politics. His upbringing instilled into him the importance of a good education, family, working hard to build a career and contributing to community.\nHighly committed to public service, Jonathan first got into politics when Gordon Brown’s Government tried to close the hospital in the town he grew up in, and helped local MPs lead the successful campaign to prevent the closure.\nJonathan then served as a local Councillor in Sussex for 16 years, including as a Council Leader, as well as founding an education trust now responsible for the education of over 3,500 young people.\nJonathan chaired a high performing Community Safety Partnership for four years, giving him a significant insight into effective strategies for crime prevention and tackling anti-social behaviour.\nThrough his work with Sussex PCC Katy Bourne, Jonathan has a strong understanding of the role of Police & Crime Commissioner and how the role can be used to deliver effective and efficient policing.\nAlongside his public service, Jonathan is a serial business builder, creating jobs and delivering great services. He started his first business at the age of 24 and now leads a company delivering major projects to clients across a range of sectors. Jonathan has also worked in education in Hertfordshire.\nHertfordshire means a lot to Jonathan. It’s where he met his partner who is Herts born and bred and Jonathan now lives in the county with his family.\nJonathan said:\n“I am delighted to have been selected to stand for election as Police & Crime Commissioner. Setting the strategic policing priorities on behalf of the public, holding the Chief Constable to account and setting a £294m annual budget is a big job and it matters who does it.\n“I pay tribute to David Lloyd on his considerable service and achievement in the last 12 years. David has delivered the highest number of police officers in Hertfordshire’s history, with one of the lowest council tax precepts. Hertfordshire remains one of the safest places in the country.\n“I have a clear plan to build on David’s achievements. My public service leadership experience makes me well placed to serve Hertfordshire residents. If elected I’ll work to ensure the record officer numbers translate into the visible and responsive neighbourhood policing we all want to see. I’ll support Hertfordshire Constabulary to be tough on crime and provide effective, value for money policing. I want every family in Hertfordshire, including my own, to be able to grow and thrive in a safe community”.\nDavid Lloyd, retiring Herts PCC, said:\n“I’m delighted that Jonathan has been chosen as our candidate. His understanding of local government and excellent leadership skills mark him out as likely to be a brilliant PCC. He will set a plan and budget based on the sound Conservative principles of lower crime, stronger neighbourhood policing and value for money. I am sure those values will be endorsed by the people of Hertfordshire”.",
