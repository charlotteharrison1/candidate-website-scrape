Blaming the Health Service’s ills on inefficiencies rather than on chronic underfunding is an insult to thousands of dedicated and hardworking staff who are underpaid and struggle because they are under-resourced.\n“The Green Party would restore the public health budget by increasing spending by £1.4 billion and immediately increase NHS spending by £8 billion, to ensure NHS staff can be paid decently. Reforms to the tax system – including through changes to Capital Gains Tax, National Insurance and the abolition of “non dom status” – could raise the billions needed to properly invest in our health services.\n“Successive governments have pointed the finger of blame at ‘inefficiencies.’ It’s regrettable to see Wes Streeting treading this well-worn path rather than pledging to increase funding for the NHS which is so desperately needed.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

  "https_broadland_greenparty_org_uk_homepage_general-election_/https_broadland_greenparty_org_uk_local-councils/content_32.html": "Norfolk County Council\nNorfolk County Council is the “upper-tier” local government authority providing a range of services including Children’s, Adult Social Care, Highways, Public Health, Environmental services (including waste recycling and disposal), Trading Standards, and Fire and Rescue services.\nNorfolk County Council holds full council elections every four years. The last full council election was held on 6 May 2021. Click for Results of the 2021 local elections. In between full elections, there may be a by-election to cover individual vacancies that occur.\nThe Norfolk County Council budget has two elements:\nA revenue budget includes spending on the day-to-day running of services, for example, salaries, contracts for services, and council building expenses. Gross revenue budget for 2021-22: £1.518bn.\nA capital programme includes expenditure on items that will be used by Norfolk County Council for more than one year: for example, land, buildings, Great Yarmouth Third river crossing, major road building projects. The capital programme for 2021-25+ of £538m includes funding of major schemes. Major schemes require a business case to be made to the relevant central government department who then decide on whether to make grant funding available. The outline business case for the Norwich Western Link road, for example, was submitted to the Department for Transport (DfT) in 2021 to try to secure 85% of the funding required.\nCity, District and Borough Councils in Norfolk\nBelow Norfolk County Council there are 7 second-tier local government district councils: Breckland District, Broadland District, Great Yarmouth Borough, North Norfolk District, Norwich City, King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough, and South Norfolk District.\nBorough/district council responsibilities can vary but generally include local planning and building control, council housing, environmental health, markets, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\nSome districts have borough status, which simply means the local council is called a borough council instead of a district council and gives them the right to appoint a mayor. Borough status is granted by royal charter the origin of which can date back centuries.\nNorwich has city status, but this does not mean any extra powers other than the right to call itself a city council and appoint a mayor.\nBroadland District Council is made up of 47 District Councillors representing 27 wards. District elections are held every four years. The most recent election took place on 2 May 2019, view the results for this election.\nBroadland Green Party will be campaigning hard for the May 2023 district election. Please let us know if you would like to help!\nBroadland District Council and South Norfolk Council collaboration\nIn July 2018, Broadland District Council and South Norfolk District Council decided to begin a formal partnership of the two councils with a shared Managing Director.\nThe collaboration has resulted in an alignment of services, the sharing of staff, and a joint website. Since January 2020, staff have been working as one officer team, serving the two independent councils covering a huge geographical area for a district council. For example, it is 40 miles from Diss in the south to Aylsham in the north, a driving time of over 1 hour, on a good day. It’s a similar distance and driving time from Foulsham in the west to the edge of Great Yarmouth district in the east.\nSo, whilst costs might be reduced by employing staff teams to deliver over a wider geographical area it puts more pressure on staff and potentially a diminished service for the combined 260,000 residents and 10,000 businesses.\nThe councils state, “the main focus of our collaboration is to drive economic and housing growth”. This focus on growth to the potential detriment of our environment and long-term well-being must be monitored carefully and challenged when necessary.\nThis is why it is vital to have effective, hard-working, Green Party councillors elected to represent the concerns and priorities of local residents.\nParish and Town Councils in Norfolk\nTown and Parish Councils are the first tier of local government. They are corporate bodies composed of elected councillors with a chair and vice-chair supported by a parish clerk. The Norfolk Association of Local Councils is a good source of information on the 540 parishes in Norfolk.\nParish councils vary in their level of activity, expenditure, numbers of councillors, and the frequency of meetings. Local councils raise a precept through the Council Tax to fund local projects and activities among the council tax-paying households in the parish.\nLocal councils support or influence the other tiers of local government (county and district/borough councils).\nParish councils have a consultation role in respect of planning applications although they are not the deciding authority. They support events and community buildings, provide assets such as village signs, dog litter, and waste bins. Activities and facilities can include providing allotments, burial grounds and cemeteries or markets, toilets, parks and play areas.\nCouncil Tax\nCouncil tax is a system of local taxation on domestic property collected by local authorities. Council Tax contributes to the funding of local councils.\nDistrict councils collect Council Tax in Norfolk for county, district, parish councils, and police and fire services.\nCouncil tax accounts for 29% of Norfolk County Council funding and will raise £439m in 2021-22.\nAll homes are given a council tax valuation band. The band is based on the value of your home. A different amount of council tax is charged on each band. Each local authority keeps a list of domestic property in its area, together with its valuation band and is called the valuation list. You can check your council tax band on GOV.UK or you can find it on your council tax bill. For further information and help with Council Tax go to Citizens Advice.\nLand Value Tax (LVT)\nThe Green Party supports a fairer alternative to Council Tax called Land Value Tax (LVT). It is part of the answer to many of today’s pressing problems: lack of affordable housing, sufficient housing in general, gentrification, and other unsustainable trends. Plus, it removes some unfair taxes too.\nLVT is a tax on the value of land. Not on the house or building; just the land. It is paid by the landowners and should not be passed on to tenants. It would simplify taxes by replacing Council Tax, Business Rates, and land Stamp Duty.\nWhy is LVT green?\nBig commercial builders, as distinct from your local builder, have land-banks, two or three years’ worth, usually with planning permission to build houses. It rests undeveloped waiting for a profitable time to build and sell the homes. A tax on land would force them to either build quicker, sell the land to someone who will, or re-designate the land, e.g. for a park. The latter would reduce the land’s monetary value (but maintain its biodiversity value!) and so reduce their tax.\nLVT efficiently drives the process of using land for its designated purpose. And where land is scarce, like in a city surrounded by Green Belt, LVT is important for a fairer, more sustainable future.\nLVT is a solution for cities. A 2016 Danish study (where LVT is implemented) saw it stabilising or even reducing land prices. It makes it more affordable for the state to build much needed cheaper properties and reduces the pressures of gentrification.\nBased on a longer article by Clive Stevens in Green World: A Tax on Tories?

It does very little to ease the underlying financial stresses that local authorities are facing after years of rising costs around social care, special educational needs and reduced government grants.\n“The government’s planning reforms and stated intentions for local government re-organisation mean stripping local people of a democratic say in how local services are delivered, while this latest funding round deprives councils of the means to deliver quality services for all.\n“We need a real change in local government finances that enables councils to use money raised from those with the broadest shoulders to deliver quality services that people need and want.\nThe government have also brought out a White Paper on Devolution and the re-organisation of local government.\nGreen Party MP Ellie Chowns said:\n“There is much to be welcomed in this White Paper including strengthening the rights of communities to purchase cherished local assets such as youth clubs, libraries or sport facilities; increasing powers over control of local transport, better alignment of public services including police, health and probation and removing the need for government to sign off decisions for locally specific things like cycle lanes.\n“The big gap is the democratic deficit in Labour’s plans. This risks being devolution that steals power away from local people. We have to ask, how will local communities get heard? And who will hold mayors to account?\n“We need to keep the local in local government. That means decision making as close as possible to the people most impacted; it involves trusting local communities to know what is best for them and supporting them with investment to deliver real change. And true democracy must include a fair proportional voting system for local elections, which seems to be a glaring omission from this White Paper.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

Norfolk County Council say this is a temporary closure but the service is clearly under threat.\nLetter Text:\nDear Sir\nThe Postwick Park and Ride service was reinstated, after being closed during the pandemic for use as a Covid Testing centre, from 21 November 2022 and ran up until 24 December. Unfortunately limited time had been allocated to advertising it and signs on the highway to inform motorists that it was open were conspicuous by their absence. A few days later I received notification via a local parish council that Norfolk County Council intended to close the service. It has since been clarified that the intention was to enable shoppers to access the city during the festive period (rather than offering a viable service for those working in the city) and that this may be a temporary closure if it can be proven that passenger numbers will recover. It has not been made clear however, how this can be evaluated while the service ceases to run.\nThe Norwich P and R services were apparently self-financing pre-Covid and passenger levels have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. It is not clear whether they will ever do so, and I would argue that they may not unless a new approach is taken to this service provision. Residents will use a bus service if it is convenient, comfortable and financially advantageous for them to do so. The Postwick P and R service only runs from the site into the city. It is, however, fast and efficient. If a stop at the Broadland Business Park was added at one end of the route, with stops at both the NNUH and the UEA at the other end, if may well prove to be far more of a success. The benefits for many residents living east of Norwich of being able to park at the Postwick site and take a direct rapid bus route to the hospital would be considerable. With the area surrounding the Broadland and Broadland Gate Business Parks marked for significant growth both in terms of housing and business development, this would provide increased passenger revenue.\nInstead, it seems the response is to close the service and blame residents for a failure to use it, rather than to look at other more viable and imaginative options. This is hardly the approach that a business would take. A successful business would produce a business plan which included a range of costed options taking into account both short and long term forecasts. P and R services reduce congestion in cities and carbon emissions. If the service is never reopened which I suspect is likely to be the case, the opposite will happen.\nKind Regards\nEleanor Laming\nCouncillor for Brundall Ward, Broadland District Council",

At the same time, it needs to be honest with the public about the need to reach net zero and what it will take to get there.\n“We know that people are extremely concerned about the environment and want clear leadership and action on the climate. This means insulating people’s homes, investing in renewables and making sustainable transport more affordable, accessible and convenient.\n“Not only would this help the UK reach its climate commitments but it would also help households through the cost of living crisis through cheaper bills and creating jobs.\n“Instead, we have a government which is going backwards on all of these things, stoking fears of change and undermining the good work already being done.\n“And let’s not pretend there isn’t the money around to make this happen. The government is currently spending billions of pounds subsidising the fossil fuel industry which is actively making the climate crisis worse, costing us all billions more in the process.\n“Meanwhile, a wealth tax on the richest 1% could go a long way to fund the changes necessary to reduce emissions and ensure those with the broadest shoulders play a part in improving the lives of those who are struggling right now.”",

You can’t burn oil in the form of plastic and meet the target of Net Zero emissions in 2050; nor can you sign up local authorities to 20 year contracts to burn waste and expect them to recycle 65% of waste by 2030. The last government was finally waking up to the direct contradiction between environment and incineration, I hope this government will say no more incineration and put this big mistake into reverse.”",

How do the priorities outlined for decarbonisation of Norfolk’s transport sector align with the closure of the Postwick Park and Ride, which if reinstated using a suitable business case and sufficient advertising would contribute to reduction of carbon emissions?\nResponse from the Cabinet Member for Environment and Waste / Highways Infrastructure and TransportWe fully recognise the role that the Park & Ride service, including that from Postwick, can fulfill for our Climate Strategy. This must be measured against the comparatively low patronage that Park and Ride has experienced post-pandemic and re-opening the site and service would add up to £200k to the subsidy that Norfolk County Council have had to find since the pandemic to open and run the other sites. We have every intention of re-opening the site once passenger numbers on the P&R service as a whole have recovered to 75% of pre-covid levels, which will ensure that we have sufficient funds to run all the sites.\nSupplementary Question from Eleanor Laming\nWhy did the bid for Bus Service Improvement Plan Funding in 2022 not include a funding request to help reinstate Postwick Park and Ride?\nResponse from the Cabinet Member for Highways, Infrastructure and TransportA key criteria for Bus Service Improvement Plan funding, set by the DfT was that it could not be used to subsidise services that had been commercially viable and were now struggling and at risk of withdrawal. As the P&R service was commercially run by the bus operator before the pandemic, the funding and therefore the Plan could not be used to reinstate the Postwick P&R service.",

Question from Cllr LamingUK biodiversity is in decline and a spotlight will be on the subject during the COP15 event in Canada from 7-19 December 2022. Has Broadland District Council ever commissioned a report on the state of biodiversity in Broadland, and does it plan to do so in the near future? Response from the Portfolio Holder for Environmental Excellence\nThe Council had previously engaged with Natural England, the Environment Agency, Norfolk Wildlife Trust and the Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership in the preparation of Local Plans. As a part of this process the Council had also prepared sustainability appraisals, incorporating strategic environmental assessments, and habitat regulations assessments. Both the engagement with these environmental bodies and the preparation of the aforementioned reports have informed the Council’s Local Plan policies and Green Infrastructure strategies.\nIn addition to this, work was currently underway to update the Greater Norwich Growth Board Green Infrastructure Strategies. It was agreed, as part of this work, that there would be the need to conduct a biodiversity baseline study across the partnership area. This work was currently in the process of being scoped out with the view to go out to tender in the New Year. Supplementary Question from Cllr Laming\nAn online search for “Biodiversity in Broadland, Norfolk” returned a reference to the Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership which she believed involved some 20 different organisations including Broadland District Council. It appeared the partnership had been established in 1996 but the latest news post was dated 2019. Is the Partnership still in place and, if not, why not? Response from Portfolio Holder for Environmental Excellence\nThe Portfolio Holder stated that to provide a comprehensive reply, she would do this by way of a written response after the meeting. Response Later Received\nThe new Local Nature Recovery Partnership (LNRP), which Broadland District Council officers are actively engaged with, will deliver on a high-level set of priorities including the process of developing a Local Nature Recovery strategy and mapping project. The Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership remains active and, in tandem with the overarching aims of the LNRP, will deliver locally focussed community work.",

In particular, future carbon emission data was highly controversial and unconvincing whilst totally inadequate responses were given to concerns over the impact of the road on very rare barbastelle bat colonies in the Wensum Valley.\nA key part of the problem is that data and evidence just haven’t been made publicly available and so mistrust and suspicion has been stoked through the inability, or unwillingness, of the council to provide the evidence and legal advice.\nAll this is in the week the Welsh Government announced it is freezing all future road-building projects as part of its plans to tackle the climate emergency. The deputy minister for climate change told the Welsh parliament, “We need a shift away from spending money on projects that encourage more people to drive”. Can Norfolk learn from the Welsh?",

Taking our water companies into public ownership, so they work for people, not profit, will be a clear Green Party manifesto commitment.\n“For decades, money that should have been invested in improved infrastructure has been siphoned off to water company executives and shareholders. It’s time to flush this failed experiment with privatisation down the drain and for a service as vital as water and sewage to be run for the public good.\n“It should also be acknowledged that agricultural pollution contributes to 62% of waterways in England failing to meet good standards.

[1]\nGreen Party co-leader Carla Denyer said:\n“There is wealth in the UK. It is distributed unfairly. Our economy is failing because our wealth, rather than circulating and benefiting everybody, is held in the stagnant assets of the super-rich.\n“The Budget this year should focus on recirculating that wealth and making it work for everybody.\n“Our wealth tax and wider tax proposals would also begin to tackle the desperate inequality that is a source of so many of our problems as a country.\n“Taken together, we estimate that changes to Capital Gains Tax and National Insurance, alongside a new wealth tax, would raise over £50bn per year that would be available for the vital public investment our country is crying out for.\n“We need to face up to the long-term threats to our economy, and the immediate costs which are currently being carried by those who can least bear them.\n“We need a large-scale green investment programme to transform our economy from one reliant on cheap labour and fossil fuels to one that puts people and planet first.\n“We need to deliver a housing programme that offers people warm, affordable- to-heat homes and helps councils cut people’s energy bills by upgrading home insulation.\n“We need to invest in a health and social care system that guarantees dignity for all and to end the blight of long-term sickness. The rising cost of social care is hitting councils hard. Our reforms could help them too.\n“We need to give a hand to hard-pressed small businesses in the hospitality sector which have been hit by Covid and the cost-of-living crisis. The temporary 5% VAT rate should continue and extend to all activities in the cultural and sports sectors, and leisure activities. Indeed, we would be more ambitious, zero-rating all these activities for the life of the next Parliament.\n“The Conservatives have broken Britain and Labour seems to be shredding any policy that might fix it. Our five-point Green Budget alternative would create a fairer and more caring country.\n“Of course, this ambitious programme of rebalancing our economy toward planet and people and away from profiteers and speculators must be paid for. That’s why we are proposing an immediate wealth tax and other tax reforms, while recognising that much of the investment would generate revenue in the medium- and long-term.\n“Our wealth tax on the super-rich and wider tax reforms would be the fair way to fund the things we need to create a healthier society – high quality housing, social care and good jobs in a green economy.\n“The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned the Chancellor: “the economic case for tax cuts before the next Spending Review is completed is weak” and reliant on severe cuts to local government, disability benefits and other key public services. The IFS is also correct to note that “the UK’s tax system is in dire need of reform.” [2]\n“Our approach offers a fairer, greener alternative – it doesn’t pay for election tax bribes by slashing spending on public services.\n“Instead, it argues the case for real reforms and investment that put people and planet first.\n“That is why we are proposing a wealth tax that will begin to shift the cost of dealing with the long-term crises we face away from those who can least afford to pay it to the super-rich.”\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n[1] budget-background-v3.pdf (greenparty.org.uk)\n[2] https://ifs.org.uk/publications/context-march-2024-budget\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

That means being tougher with developers over requiring a higher proportion of genuinely affordable and homes to rent and to buy as part of new developments. Equally developers must be made to honour real commitments to invest in local services that housebuilding does put additional pressure on.\nThis all can be done and still reverse the disastrous decline in biodiversity and protect local democracy. But this has to be done with communities, including through strengthening the role of neighbourhood plans, not imposed onto them by profit driven developers.\nAnd Ministers should be taking this opportunity to look in the round at the housing crisis, and prioritising funds for increasing supply and ending right to buy, alongside building the right homes in the right place and the right price.\nAs it stands, this planning framework confirms many of the fears of those who not only want to protect this country’s degraded nature. We are not on course to meet most of the legally-binding nature recovery targets we have signed up to and this Planning Framework makes it even less likely we will hit them. This is more than a missed opportunity, it’s a dereliction of duty. We can and we must tackle both the housing crisis and the nature crisis. This new NPPF currently does neither.\nThe Government isn’t only bringing more and more land into its definition of ‘grey belt’ which can be built on, it is removing any local democratic say in the process. The deputy prime minister’s claim that this will remove “chaos and subjectiveness” from the system doesn’t wash. People have the right to have a say over major changes to their local community. This is local democracy in action.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

The Broads Authority is also part of the GNDP but produces a separate local plan.\nThe GNLP, which has been publicly consulted on at regular stages, sets out a vision for growth and identifies sites for new homes, jobs and infrastructure while protecting the area’s unique environment and habitats.\nThe plan will provide the basis for planning decisions for the foreseeable future, providing opportunities for around 45,000 new homes to meet the needs for housing in both our urban and rural areas between 2018 and 2038. Around 9,000 of those homes have already been built. The plan also provides for around 33,000 new jobs, as well as for green spaces and additional infrastructure.\nThe Plan’s examination by the Government’s Planning Inspectorate is now close to being completed and the inspectors have reported that they are supportive of the great majority of the sites we submitted for inclusion in the plan. The inspectors have shared modifications to the plan that they would like to see the partnership make and those are the changes that are being consulted on. This is normal for a plan of this complexity and the changes requested are comparatively minor. Adoption of the plan will mean that Greater Norwich will have an up-to-date local plan with a clear and sustainable strategy and site allocations that will promote investment in our economy and provide the much-needed homes, jobs and infrastructure, including through the continued use of pooled Community Infrastructure Levy funding.\nBy confirming the ongoing commitment to plan-led joint working, it will also assist Greater Norwich in accessing national funding streams, especially for infrastructure and regeneration programmes. Importantly, proposed revisions to national policy, if enacted as recently stated by government, should mean that for five years after adoption of the plan, there would be no need to annually demonstrate a five-year land supply for Greater Norwich. This would significantly reduce the pressure to grant permissions for non-allocated housing sites and further increase the benefits of having an adopted plan. The consultation will end at midday on Wednesday 6 December 2023.\nWhere you can view the consultation documents\nThe consultation documents will be available to view on the GNLP website. Hard copies will be available for public viewing during normal office hours at the following locations:\n- Broadland District Council and South Norfolk Council offices, The Horizon Centre, Broadland Business Park, Peachman Way, Norwich NR7 0WF. Monday to Friday 8:30am to 5pm (by appointment).\n- Contact the GNLP team using the details below to make an appointment.\nYou can also view the consultation documents in Norfolk libraries using their computers.\nHow to make representations\nThe preferred way, and the easiest and most efficient, is to receive representations online using the consultation system on the GNLP website. Alternatively, you can submit a response form by email or post: either download a response form from the website or contact the team by email to gnlp@norfolk.gov.uk or by telephone on 01603 306603 to request one.\nPromoted by Jan Davis, 21 Church Rd., Cantley, Norwich, NR13 3SN, on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales",

In the shorter term, we would provide an emergency grant to homeowners, landlords and councils to fund immediate insulation improvements to those at risk of fuel poverty, so that those who need support most urgently get it first.",

Will Broadland District Council join with many other Councils and sign up to show support for this initiative and if not why?\nIn response, the Portfolio Holder for Environmental Excellence stated\nADEPT, was the association of directors of environment, economy, planning and transport. They represented directors of county, unitary and combined authorities, along with directors of local enterprise partnerships, sub-national transport boards and corporate partners drawn from key service sectors throughout England. Broadland Council was not a part of this group.\nADEPT had identified five priorities of the “Blueprint for Accelerating Climate Action and a Green Recovery at the Local Level”. These already aligned closely with the Council’s Environmental Strategy and would be reflected in the forthcoming Environmental Delivery Plan. The document also set out a number of actions that upper tier authorities and central government could take to accelerate the ability of local authorities to influence the transition to a Net Zero economy. Those priority recommendations falling within the remit of the Broadland District Council were already being actioned. The draft Environmental Strategy was available on the Council’s website and would be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the Environmental Excellence Panel. The Council would continue to get on with delivering environmental targets and not just talking about it.",

Even worse, it suggests Investment Zones could be allowed in National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and other protected environments.The legal requirement to achieve Net Zero by 2050 has also been completely ignored.\n“As Greens we urge local councils to take a stand: to refuse to agree to a new streamlined overarching planning system; to make clear their commitment to local control of planning, and insist existing protections for the environment and for nature are retained.\n“We do urgently need investment in our local communities. But Greens have a very different vision of how we can create prosperity.\n“We desperately need to insulate our homes and workplaces, provide clean and cheap renewable energy, improve public transport, produce healthy local food and help nature thrive. We also need serious investment in our crumbling health and social care services. All of which will help create thousands of new jobs.\n“We understand the desperate need many councils have for investment and funding. But we will resist harmful Investment Zones and continue to fight for fairer, greener communities.”\nNotes",

The Green Party is calling on government to offer a support package to help firms thrive in their green transition.\nSmall businesses are the lifeblood of communities and help make our towns and cities diverse, distinctive and unique. Many businesses want to make a success of becoming more sustainable, but they need government to get behind them and offer the right support.\nIt is crucial that both national and local government help small and independent businesses to survive and ultimately thrive.\nGreen Proposals include:\n- Grants for small businesses to help them go greener. This would include investing an additional £2 billion in Green Transition Grants for small businesses to help them prepare for and take advantage of the opportunities offered by greening the economy. Analysis by the British Business Bank found that SMEs account for almost one third of all UK emissions and around half of total UK business emissions. The Government is currently providing very little financial support for small business in the transition to Net Zero. Currently only small sums from the UK’s Shared Prosperity Fund have been channelled via local authorities. We need a competitively fair transition to net zero that benefits rather than hinders SMEs.\n- Bring in the prompt payment code into law. This would prevent late payers from pub lic-procurement contracts. We would mandate the Small Business Commissioner to investigate potential instances of poor payment proactively, instead of only when a complaint has been made. It is not fair that the public sector and large business stress the cash flow of SME suppliers through late payment.\n- Assistance for small businesses to decarbonise their transport needs. Independent traders and tradespeople need access to electric vans and other low carbon transport solutions on the same terms as large companies. SMEs face greater barriers to decarbonising their transport than do large businesses. For instance, they are impacted by market shortages of second-hand, low emissions vehicles which has meant larger businesses have been able to obtain suitable vehicles while smaller businesses have not. Greens want to see government offering information, advice and market interventions such as grants so that SMEs are able to obtain suitable vehicles and have the right incentives to overcome these and other barriers.\n- Reform VAT to support small businesses. There needs to be a review of our VAT system so that it differentially supports smaller shops and businesses compared to larger and online businesses.\n- Suspend Covid loan repayments. Similarly, Covid loans were a great help for businesses during the pandemic lockdowns, but repayments are now adding to the financial strain of the cost-of-living crisis.

Many hospitals and ambulance trusts have declared critical incidents and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said that 300-500 people are dying each week because of delays in emergency care.\nThe critical shortage of hospital beds – 2.4 per 1,000 people against 7.8 in Germany – is made much worse by hospitals being unable to safely discharge patients needing home care, which is now often not available due to cuts in council funding.\nSystematic underfunding of NHS infrastructure and low pay for health and social care workers are making it extremely hard to retain and recruit staff. A third of all junior doctors are planning to quit the NHS due to the poor pay and working conditions. Nurses have seen steep cuts in the real value of their wages over the past 12 years and many can no longer meet the basic needs of themselves and their families. The Royal College of Nursing has voted to go on strike for the first time ever.\nTo add insult to injury, NHS trusts are paying exorbitant fees to private staffing agencies – money which the government refuses to spend on increasing basic rates of pay for regular staff.\nMeanwhile, the creeping privatisation of the NHS continues, with ever larger amounts of public money being spent on outsourced health services run for private profit. And the full scale of the scandalous misspending of potentially billions of pounds on defective PPE and Test & Trace contracts is only now coming to light.\nUnlike other parties, the Green Party fully backs NHS and social care workers in their struggle for decent pay. We’re also unequivocally opposed to the ongoing privatisation of healthcare and want to see social care services – which are inseparable from healthcare – provided free on the basis of need.\nThere are many other ways in which Green Party policies would create a healthier society, by reducing air pollution, providing accessible green spaces for all, creating better walking and cycling routes, and tackling the poverty and gross inequality that are at the root of so much illness.\nBut right now it’s time to take a stand for a free, comprehensive and properly funded health and social care system that works fairly and effectively for all.\nDr Pallavi DevulapalliHealth, Social Care & Public Health Spokesperson\nThe Green Party",

This is what we call “fossil fuel”. These products (coal, oil and gas) have given us cheap energy which we use for transport, heating etc, but they are not replaceable.\nUnfortunately we have used so much in such a short time (approximately 150 years) that we have literally heated our atmosphere. This means that the earth’s atmospheric temperature is rising and the ice is melting. The rise in temperature creates more water in gas as well as liquid form which produces more clouds and therefore more rain. The energy released in burning fossil fuel also creates more atmospheric energy and therefore more storms.\nThis is one of the key reasons it is necessary to stop fossil fuel use as fast as possible.\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

Norfolk County Council should be applauded for consulting people on a strategy to look at alternative modes of transport, which will hopefully unlock government funding to improve facilities for walking, wheeling and cycling.The strategy does provide a full explanation with reasons as to why these modes of transport would be an advantageous for residents themselves, and for the county as a whole.\nThis is not a plan to alarm or restrict car users, but a sensible proposition to encourage the use of healthier forms of transport to reduce road congestion, air pollution and carbon emissions.\nMany residents are both car drivers and walkers, wheelers or cyclists. Better provision for the latter will increase the number of short, local journeys made using non-car modes leaving the roads less congested for those who have to use a car.\nThe 2030 target is certainly ambitious, but every trip made using active travel makes a difference and needs to be seen positively.\nWe need to invest more local government funds in active travel and public transport infrastructure, maintain our existing road infrastructure, and restrict the building of environmentally damaging road projects as the Welsh government have done.

There is more than enough money in the economy to pay for this. Indeed, the Green Party would go further and faster, investing at least double what Labour originally pledged, so we can turbo charge the transition to a green economy.\n“Greens recognise that investing in a green future will provide people with economic, social and environmental security. By decarbonising industry, insulating buildings, and ramping up renewable energy infrastructure, the UK can drastically reduce emissions, cut household bills and create new, good quality, well-paid and secure jobs in every corner of the country.\n“Investing in this secure future is a political choice. By ditching its green investment plan, and making a series of other U-turns, Labour has clearly signalled that it is turning its back on a fairer, greener future. It is clear we are going to need a group of Green MPs in parliament after the next election pushing whoever forms the next government to do the right thing.”\nNotes\n1.

Caroline told constituents: “The reason I came into politics was to change things. 13 years ago, it was inconceivable that Parliament would have declared a climate emergency; I’ve put issues like a universal basic income and a legal right to access nature on the political agenda; secured the first Parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform; and thanks to my work in Parliament, a Natural History GCSE will soon be on the syllabus. I have said the previously unsayable, only to see it become part of the mainstream, on coal, on the myth that endless economic growth makes us happier, on a Green New Deal. My determination to try and make change is stronger than ever. I look forward to having the time to explore ever more imaginative and creative ways of helping to make a liveable future a reality.”",

The site is currently earmarked for development (Planning Applications: 20190016 and 20211168).\nThe site seems to have been sprayed very recently and comprehensively with some form of chemical weedkiller. The vegetation that had been flourishing on the site is now dead and brown. I am extremely concerned that if this is the case, any biodiversity on the site will have been severely damaged and if a chemical has been used it will enter the water courses nearby, particularly as we have had heavy rain recently.\nIf chemicals have been sprayed on such a site it is not possible to stop them from being spread externally. Land nearby is used by dog walkers and is home to a variety of wildlife. The adjacent Belmore Plantation is earmarked for use as a recreational woodland area should the housing planned for the Racecourse Plantation off Plumstead Road East go ahead (Planning Applications 20161896 and 20212075)\nIt is of particular irony that this month is No Mow May when residents and councils are being encouraged to allow the growth of grassland and vegetation to encourage the survival of pollinators at a time when biodiversity in the UK is severely under threat.\nIt is expected that from November 2023 all developments will be required to show a 10% biodiversity net gain in line with the Environment Act 2021 so I find this loss of vegetation very worrying.\nhttps://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/23522263.chemicals-possibly-used-thorpe-st-andrew-green-space/",

The EA is removing 500 of the 2,000 new flood defence projects that were originally included.\nA shortfall of £34 million in the budget for maintenance will also leave another 200,000 properties in danger due to erosion of existing flood defences.\nGreen Party co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, said:\n“Despite the promise of record funding, the delivery is less than needed to cope with the potential flooding that we are beginning to witness from climate breakdown. As the thousands who have recently been flooded out will testify, prevention is better than cure. There is a big shortfall in the Environment Agency’s own targets, with over a hundred thousand people living in the most vulnerable areas being told that they are not a priority. Also, the false economy of skimping on maintenance means that another 200,000 people have to keep their fingers crossed that their existing flood defences don’t collapse.\n“The government should allow people in vulnerable areas to apply for small grants to protect their businesses and households before a flood hits, rather than only making these available after the event.\n“There also needs to be a greater emphasis on creating natural flood defences through practices such as planting trees and hedges that absorb more water and restoring bends in rivers. And rather than bulldozing planning laws, as Labour proposes, we need to reassess planning regulations which unbelievably still allow for new buildings on flood plains.\n“Ultimately, we need to deal with the root of the problem, which is to tackle the emissions responsible for heating our planet.\n“The UK government needs to show leadership at the forthcoming COP28 climate talks by demonstrating a strong commitment to ending the use of fossil fuels, ramping up renewable energy, insulating homes, and boosting public transport and infrastructure for active travel.\n“Unfortunately, instead, the Conservatives are taking a wrecking ball to the climate by making it easier to drill for oil and gas and undermining investment in renewables. Invariably the cost of inaction on flood defences and climate change will be borne by ordinary people.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

We need to press our ambitions with a renewed vigour.\n“The fact that UK climate change minister, Graham Stuart, returned to London to vote on the Rwanda Bill just as the hardest part of the negotiations got underway tells the world this Conservative government just doesn’t care.\n“This is the price we pay for government chaos at home – being sidelined at the most crucial moment in the COP28 negotiations.\n“COP agreed a ‘transition’ away from fossil fuels that falls far short of the fair phase out that is needed. It offers market solutions that will leave behind the poorest countries and bolster the Petro-states.\n“Despite this disappointing result, we can still achieve an outcome that avoids the worst of the climate emergency while also creating safer streets, cleaner air, warmer homes, more jobs in renewable energy and support for our farmers to produce more food locally.\n“There is a groundswell of calls for action from around the world – at least 127 countries called for or endorsed a decision to phase out fossil fuels at COP28. Now is the time for action.\n“We got some limited cash pledges to kick-start the loss and damage fund, more warm words about the 1.5°C target and a desperate compromise on fossil-fuels that protects the interests of oil producers rather than the planet.\n“We urged COP28 to achieve three vital things – the changes needed now to keep to the 1.5°C target set eight years ago in Paris; the phasing out of fossil fuels, and generous contributions to the loss and damage fund to support poorer countries through the climate crisis.\n“The UK’s £60 million contribution to the loss and damage fund is not new money, and the totals pledged from the richest countries amount to less than 0.2% of the irreversible damage poorer countries are facing from global heating each year.\n“Taken together, COP28 has not delivered nearly enough to tackle the climate crisis. That means it is all the more important to make our demand for action now clearer and louder.\n“For instance, we must make the UK government face up to the science and cancel new oil and gas licences for the North Sea.\n“It must now increase investment in onshore and offshore wind, and other forms of renewable energy, to deliver on pledges made.\n“And the government must fund local councils to deliver a nationwide programme of home and business insulation to cut energy use and lower people’s bills.\n“If the government here, and other world leaders, would engage seriously, we could be creating a much better and fairer future for people throughout the UK and around the world.\n“We can still achieve that future. The best time to act was decades ago. The next best time is right now.”\nDeputy leader Zack Polanski points out that the failure at COP28 to offer an end to fossil fuel use demanded more action, not less. Zack said on LBC News: “Every year that a COP is wasted, or we don’t make real progress on that Paris Agreement, that’s another year that is ticking by. There’s an existential threat, both to our planet and ecological collapse. These things don’t have to be negative. It’s actually about having cleaner air, more cohesive communities, investing in people and good, greener jobs. All of those things are ready for the taking. People just need to vote for it.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

She will dismiss the chancellor’s Autumn Statement, saying it will be “another failed opportunity to end the cost-of-living crisis, tackle the climate crisis and restore crumbling public services on which we all rely.”\nDenyer said:\n“Our 10-point plan identifies around £30 billion of additional funds that would be available from simply rebalancing the tax system so that the super-rich pay their fair share and both people and planet benefit.”\n“The extra revenue raised would enable the government to pay NHS staff an inflation-matching pay award, increase access to NHS dentists, increase Universal Credit, abolish the two-child benefit cap, improve bus services and help small businesses take advantage of the opportunities offered by greening the economy.\n“Instead, the chancellor’s Autumn Statement will be another failed opportunity to end the cost-of-living crisis, tackle the climate crisis or restore crumbling public services. It’s clear that as the Tories continue to languish in the polls, Jeremy Hunt has more interest in electoral gimmickry that he has in creating a fairer and greener country.”\nThe Green Party’s 10-point alternative would:\n- Restore the public health budget by increasing spending by £1.4 billion [1]\n- Immediately increase NHS spending by £8 billion, to ensure NHS staff can be paid an inflation matching pay award [2]\n- Meet the Government’s current plan to increase access to NHS dentists by increasing spending 50 per cent – £1.5 billion – of the total NHS dentistry budget [3]\n- End the rise in homelessness caused by the cap on Local Housing Allowances at a cost of £700 million [4]\n- Increase Universal Credit by £40 per week at a cost of £9bn [5]\n- Abolish the two-child benefit cap to reduce poverty for some of the most vulnerable children in the country by increasing the welfare budget by £1.3 billion [6]\n- Provide the necessary powers and funding to rural local authorities to take back control of bus services so they can increase routes and service frequencies at a cost of £3bn [7]\n- Turn ISAs green by linking their tax exemptions to investments in green bonds [8]\n- Invest an additional £3billion in Green Transition Grants for small businesses to help them prepare for and take advantage of the opportunities offered by greening the economy [9]\n- Rebalance the tax system to raise an extra £30 billion through changes to Capital Gains Tax, National Insurance and the abolition of “non dom status” which would pay for the proposed measures [10]\nChampioning the Green’s alternative Autumn Statement, Carla Denyer said:\n“These fairer, greener alternatives give just a flavour of what could be done if we had a Government willing to tackle the long-term crises we face. They would start to remove the fundamental injustice that means that wealthier people who own more assets often see a lower effective tax rate than less well-off people.\n“Everyone deserves easy access to a dentist, improved public health, properly paid and supported doctors and nurses working with decent facilities, reduced poverty and homelessness, and accessible public transport.\n“There is enough money in the economy to make our country fairer and greener. What is lacking is the political will to change priorities. And Starmer’s official opposition seems no more ready to offer this than the Government is. That is why we so desperately need more Greens in Parliament to make the case for the common-sense changes that can deliver a fairer greener country.”\nNOTES on the Green Party’s 10-point plan- Restore the public health budget at a cost of £1.4 billion. The cut in public health budget has led to a fall in programs for smoking cessation and other key interventions that can lower the burden of disease. Lifestyle related non-communicable disease remains a huge component of the UK’s ill-health. Coronary heart disease and stroke are the biggest causes of death in the UK. The RCN, the RCGP and RCP are all calling for an investment in public health to lower the burden of disease in society and the pressures on the NHS. See https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(21)00394-0/fulltext\n- Immediately increase NHS spending by £8 billion, to ensure NHS staff can be paid an inflation matching pay award. The Institute of Fiscal Studies estimates that the additional costs for central and local governments arising in 2022-23 to implement a 10.5% inflation matching pay award for NHS staff, relative to a 3% baseline, would be £6.4 billion. See: Public spending, pay and pensions (ifs.org.uk) page 13\n- Ensure everyone has access to an NHS dentist by increasing spending by 50 per cent, restoring NHS dental care budgets at a cost of £1.5 billion. The British Dental Association has called for the Government to provide enough budget to meet the government’s own plans. Their estimate is that this will cost £1.5 billion, which is simply a restoring of the existing budget. The Government’s plans are to challenge the areas worst affected by a lack of NHS dentists. This funding would be only the beginning of what is needed to move towards a better national model of dental provision. See https://bda.org/news-centre/press-releases/Pages/NHS-dentistry-Costs-leave-quarter-of-patients-delaying-or-avoiding-treatment.aspx\n- End the rise in homelessness caused by the cap on Local Housing Allowances at a cost of £700 million. Local Housing Allowance determines how much of a household’s rent will be covered by Universal Credit or Housing Benefit. There has been no increase in this allowance since 2020 despite the vast increase in rents over that period, which continues at above the rate of inflation and has left very few properties affordable. In June this year the IFS found that the number of affordable properties for people in receipt of benefits had dropped from 23% in 2020 to just 5%. More than 150 councils in England wrote to the government last month urging ministers to increase Local Housing Allowance rates to cover at least 30% of local market rates. See: Rishi Sunak under pressure from ministers to raise housing benefit – BBC News\n- Increase Universal Credit by £40 per week at a cost of £9bn. There were 6.2 million people on Universal Credit in October 2023, 58% of them women. This has been increasing since March 2022, when it was 5.5 million. Universal Credit not only benefits non-working groups but also those in low-paid work – 38% of claimants were in employment in September. Around nine in ten low-income households receiving UC are unable to afford essentials. The basic rate of UC is now at its lowest level in real terms in almost 40 years, with 66% of the public now thinking it is too low. Research from JRF and Trussell Trust shows that, in 2023/24, a single adult needs at least £120 per week to cover essentials, like food, utilities, vital household items and travel. But Universal Credit’s standard allowance is currently only £85 per week for a single adult aged 25 or over – a shortfall of at least £35 per week. See: https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/inadequate-universal-credit-and-barriers-work\n- Abolish the two-child benefit cap at a cost of £1.3 billion, and alleviate poverty for some of the most vulnerable children in the country. This is a relatively small sum of money for the Government to spend that would lift 250,000 children out of poverty completely, and a further 850,000 would be in less deep poverty. This has been called for by Save the Children, Child Poverty Action Group and many campaigning and faith-based organisations. See: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/16/two-child-benefit-cap-explainer\n- Provide the necessary powers and funding to local authorities to take back control of rural bus services so they can increase routes and service frequencies, at a cost of £3bn. Buses bring more than a billion shopping trips to high streets across the country – this enables £27 billion of retail spending per year across the UK. Social, economic and environmental benefits give revenue expenditure on bus services a return on investment of up to £3.80 for every £1 spent. In 2021 CPRE calculated that by spending £3bn – just a proportion of the government’s planned £27 billion road-building programme – bus routes could serve every community of over 300 inhabitants in England with a bus service at least hourly, seven days a week. See: https://www.cpre.org.uk/news/our-report-shows-a-bus-every-village-every-hour-is-possible/\n- Change the rules on ISAs so that the £70 billion saved in them every year must be invested in green bonds as a condition of their tax-free status. Green ISAs would have to be invested in either government-backed savings accounts or bonds or private sector equivalent accounts. ISA providers would be required to invest the proceeds of sums raised in the transition to net zero, social infrastructure, such as new housing or related activities such as education, training and appropriate support services. The option of simply leaving cash in moribund bank accounts or of speculating funds on stock markets, which is how the £700 billion or more now saved in ISA accounts is currently used, would disappear over time as existing ISA account arrangements expired and new ones took their place.\n- Double grants to small businesses at cost of £3bn. Analysis by the British Business Bank found that SMEs account for almost one third of all UK emissions and around half of total UK business emissions. The Government is currently providing very little financial support for small business in the transition to Net Zero. Despite Chris Skidmore’s Net Zero Review highlighting the challenges faced by SMEs, small sums from the UK’s Shared Prosperity Fund have been channelled via local authorities. We need a competitively fair transition to Net Zero that benefits rather than hinders SMEs.\n- Rebalance the tax system to raise an extra £30 billion by:\n- Reforming Capital Gains Tax so that those profiting from owning assets pay the same tax rates as those paying taxes on income from work\n- Extending National Insurance to cover investment income as well as employment income, and removing the Upper Earnings Limit so that those on higher incomes pay the same rate on all their income\n- Abolishing “non dom status” under which a small group of UK residents with a permanent home in another country can legally avoid UK taxes on their world-wide income and investment gains\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

The aim of the group ‘Reclaim the Lane’ is to apply for reclassification to exclude all motorised vehicles, with the money for the process being raised via the crowdfunding site GoFundMe.\nSince agricultural vehicles stopped using the lane and farmers are no longer under obligation to put right any damage, trail bikes and 4x4s who do not want to use the commercial mud tracks available in Norfolk, have made the road impassable for anyone on foot, on a bicycle or on a horse. Three-quarters of potential users of this lane are effectively excluded from it.\nThere are many organisations that represent off-roaders but not everyone who engages in this hobby must belong to one. It is also worthy of note that motor vehicles already dominate our highway network and compromise the pleasure and safety experienced by those who wish to cycle, walk, and horse ride on our roads. It is highly undesirable to have our green spaces compromised in the same way. Green spaces are essential for mental and physical well-being and health, and many of Norfolk County Council’s policies reflect that the environment needs to be protected and made more accessible.

Objectors included, among others:\n- Great & Little Plumstead PC\n- Rackheath PC\n- Salhouse PC\n- Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)\nReasons for the objections varied but followed similar themes:\n- The location for the proposed houses is outside the settlement boundary/limit of Great & Little Plumstead and any other settlement boundary and therefore is contrary to established Broadland policy.\n- The site is not allocated for housing, and largely lies within land designated as countryside.\n- The proposal is against Broadland Policies addressing climate change and protecting environmental assets.\n- Broadland and Greater Norwich currently demonstrates at least a five-year supply of land for housing. I.e. there is no need to allocate even further countryside land for housing development.\n- The recent closure of the Broad Lane junction has provided a physical barrier\nbetween the site and the parish it would serve (Great & Little Plumstead) providing no integration with its Parish and Community. Green Lane East is now a dead-end road. - Limited bus services. Access to the medical centre would have to be by car adding to daily vehicle movements along a dead-end road.\n- A single access road. No joined up cycle routes or footpaths.\n- No commitment to affordable housing.\n- Rackheath currently has 800 houses waiting to be built and this development does not provide any amenities, like schools etc.\n- The medical centre is not centrally located or easy to access. Local doctors have confirmed they are not interested in operating from the location.\n- Appears a speculative proposal to gain advantage from enhanced land values in the change from agricultural land to land with planning consent.\nAnd the list of objections goes on. At the Planning Committee meeting (available on YouTube) some of the councillors being asked to vote on the application stated they “did not know”, “it was not easy”, and “I’m not sure” so if that is the case why vote it through?! Even the Leader of Broadland Council objected on the grounds that it did not fit into any current local neighbourhood plan being outside existing settlement limits!\nSo what happens? The planning committee vote through the planning application, the farmer gets a good payout, and the developer can go ahead and build houses on open countryside between the NDR and railway line and a medical centre in the wrong place with no public transport connections and no guarantee there will be any doctors to staff it!\nThis is planning in Norfolk today!!",

The following is the letter which was published on the Letters page alongside an editorial headlined, “Houses are needed – but not at nature’s expense”.\nThis week the EDP reported on changes to nutrient neutrality rules affecting house building (30th August). You reported that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Housing Minister, Michael Gove, made a literal flying visit to support the announcement. The report included the comment “council leaders, MPs and developers welcomed the tabling of an amendment to a bill which will mean, within months, decisions on some of 41,000 stalled housing schemes in Norfolk can start being made by councils”.\nThis was a misleading comment because not all council leaders were contacted for comment, including the undersigned. We cannot “welcome” a headline without understanding the detail. To clarify the hype surrounding what was clearly a politically motivated announcement we would like to point out some salient facts:\nNutrient overload of our watercourses and the Broads is a serious problem. We depend on them for our wellbeing, agriculture, and tourism. The seriousness of the situation has been amply demonstrated due to the development of toxic algal blooms and incidents of dead fish and other aquatic life particularly during periods of hot weather. This is exacerbated by well-publicised untreated sewage discharges due to inadequate provision of sewage treatment by the water companies. Additional house building without mitigation will only add to this overload which cannot be sustained if we are to safeguard the health of our watercourses. Therefore, action must be taken to deal with nutrient overload and ensure no additional nutrients enter the waterways.\nMuch of the detail to effectively manage nutrient discharges and allow our rivers to recover is still to be worked through and agreed. It will take several months for some of the measures to be included in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill. The Nutrient Mitigation Scheme run by Natural England requires further development. Larger developers will need to make a fair contribution to the scheme. Work will have to be carried out on the restoration of the most affected watercourses. Wastewater treatment works require upgrading. Runoff from farms will need to be effectively managed through improved slurry storage and management.\nThis is a complex problem needing action on many fronts. Broadland District Council, along with other Norfolk councils, has been working on potential mitigation schemes well before this announcement. We anticipate continuing this work to find sustainable solutions whilst monitoring further announcements by central government. The aim is to be able to build appropriate, truly affordable housing without causing the ecological collapse of our watercourses.\nCllr Susan Holland, Leader of Broadland District Council (BDC) and Liberal Democrat Group Leader\nCllr Natasha Harpley, Deputy Leader of Broadland District Council (BDC) and Labour Group Leader\nCllr Jan Davis, Cabinet Member for Environment and Green Group Leader",

The gas can be produced either through the electrolysis of water using renewable power to create green hydrogen or through its extraction from methane, a process that produces carbon dioxide as a by product that can then be captured and stored resulting in so-called blue hydrogen.\nAdvocates of blue hydrogen have argued it could prove more cost-effective and scalable than green hydrogen, but the soaring cost of wholesale gas has drastically increased the cost of hydrogen produced from fossil gas. And at the same time plummeting renewables costs have continued to improve the economics of green hydrogen production.”\n“Though green hydrogen is not the silver bullet to the climate crisis, it offers part of the solution if used in a targeted way for specific industries and offers an attractive solution to bridging the thorny issue of energy intermittency anxiety in the power sector, alongside advanced battery technology and the use of smart grids,” said Kofi Mbuk, senior cleantech analyst and author of the report.",

Opposition has come from many organisations ranging from the RSPB and National Trust through to Norfolk Wildlife Trust and Friends of the Earth.\nAlongside the reckless approach to the nation’s finances, the government seems intent on tearing up protection for nature. In a three-pronged assault on nature Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng plan to:\n- Scrap planning rules that protect nature in new ‘investment zones’ covering huge areas of the country.[1] [2]\n- Rip up environmental protections introduced by the EU, without plans for replacement.[3]\n- Withdraw plans to help farmers to protect nature [4], with reports suggesting the ‘Environmental Land Management Scheme’ (ELMS) has been ‘put on hold’ whilst a return to a Common Agricultural Policy type per acre payment is expected, which will break a specific manifesto pledge [5].\nJust before these announcements we also saw Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg open the door to environmentally damaging fracking, a policy that is widely opposed, will do nothing to reduce energy bills, and which the founder of Cuadrilla himself says is not viable [6].\nThe responses from those who care for nature have been overwhelming. Joan Edwards, director of policy for The Wildlife Trusts, says these policies will mean “polluters can get away with poisoning our rivers and countryside – even more than they are doing already.” [7] Hilary McGrady of the National Trust says, “environmental protections are dismissed as ‘burdens’, while investment and growth are pitted against nature and climate action.”\nIn an unprecedented statement the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham Usher, has criticised the plans announced in the government’s mini-budget to loosen planning rules as “an assault on nature”, demonstrating “a disdain for the planet” [8].\nThese proposals come as part of a growth package which is spooking markets and ruining government finances. There is no mandate for these measures: they actually reverse the direction of travel on the environment in your 2019 Conservative manifesto and have never been put to the British people.\nYet we know people’s livelihoods and local economies can be put on a sound footing with a three-pronged approach to investment: in nature recovery, in renewable energy and in home insulation to reduce energy bills. Research has shown that “Protection and use of environmental assets is key to evening out economic imbalances between metropolitan and rural areas” [9]. The recovery of nature and the revival of local living standards should and can go hand-in-hand.\nPlease could you call on your national party leaders to reverse these policies?\nPlease could your group leader provide us with a statement on your group’s views about these new policies?\nWe would suggest there is every reason to stand up for your communities and for your local environment in Broadland by making it plain that you will not support the tearing up of environmental protection and the reversal of attempts to help nature thrive.\nKind Regards,\nCllr Jan Davis\nCllr Eleanor Laming\n[2] Map of investment zones: https://twitter.com/RSPBEngland/status/1573366828222808064\n[5] “in return for funding, [farmers] must farm in a way that protects and enhances our natural environment” https://www.conservatives.com/our-plan/conservative-party-manifesto-2019\n[7] https://www.birdguides.com/news/uk-government-launches-all-out-assault-on-environment/\n[8] https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/local-council/bishop-of-norwich-slams-conservative-mini-budget-9295258\n[9] https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_918714_en.htm",

Funding would assist them with the cost of living by reducing energy bills, and would boost the local economy by employing local fitters.\nIt is proposed that the council reduces the capital set aside to fund Broadland Growth (2023-2025) to £5m, and ringfences £2m for the purpose of providing a programme to retrofit houses in the district, which are not eligible for government grant funding, with appropriate energy efficient measures.\nIt is proposed that the remaining £5m allocated for Broadland Growth would be redistributed in the Capital Programme with £2m in 2023/24 and £3m in 2024/25.\nThe design of the exact programme would be delegated to the Assistant Director of Individuals and Families to ensure value for money and to target assistance to residents in most need. Approval and fair allocation would be key and a grants-based system could be used, or alternatively a loan-based system with criteria surrounding repayment periods and interest rates etc. which would have the benefit of bringing some income back to the council.\nAs a fund for residents, it would be regarded as a revenue fund, so each year, grants or loans would be provided to residents to insulate their homes, using accredited installers.\nBroadland Growth is form of investment where the council stands to get a commercial return from the total £7m (2022-2025) loaned for various projects. So ideally the proposed programme would demonstrate payback for the council.\nAt the moment, Broadland Growth has no projects in the pipeline. The value of the allocated capital will fall with time and some could be spent now to help residents who are currently struggling. Appropriate retrofitting has a pay-back benefit in terms of fuel economies in the future.\nRodney Fincham, Assistant Director of Finance has been consulted on the financial implications of this proposal. He has confirmed that the budget (as amended) would still be robust and would still leave the council with adequate reserves.\nMike Pursehouse, Assistant Director for Individuals and Families is also aware of this proposal, and has indicated that the Warm Homes team is set up to deliver this type of agenda.\nAmendment\n1) Council reduces the capital set aside to fund Broadland Growth (2023-2025) to £5m, and ringfences £2m for the purpose of providing a programme to retrofit houses in the district.\n2) Council redistributes the remaining £5m allocated for Broadland Growth in the Capital Programme by allocating £2m in 2023/24 and £3m in 2024/25.\n3) Council delegates the design of the exact programme to the Assistant Director of Individuals and Families.\nThis budget amendment was voted on and lost, but triggered a debate which can be watched on You Tube from 41 minutes in on",

They voted to ban adverts that promote goods, products and services that are carbon intensive, with Lucas declaring them “incompatible with a sustainable society or liveable future.”\nWelcoming the motion, Sian Berry, who is campaigning to become the next Green MP for Brighton Pavilion when Caroline Lucas stands down at the next election, said:\n“We need to end the sprawl of adverts seeking to persuade us to buy products and services which wreck our climate, damage our environment and worsen our health. We need instead to make space for adverts for products and services which will support our local economies and help create a fairer and greener world – adverts for things such as active travel, healthier foods and sustainable fashion.\n“Controls on advertising are common. Transport for London restricts advertising for a range of products including junk food, and is now close to banning gambling promotion, while France and Amsterdam are also working on high carbon adverts.”\nCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said:\n“Carbon intensive companies are polluting the planet, and greenwashing their climate-wrecking activity through glitzy advertising campaigns which portray them as paragons of sustainability.\n“I’m delighted the Green Party has backed this motion to immediately ban high-carbon advertising and help end the scourge of greenwashing on our society.

BDC adopted an organisational 2030 target for achieving net- zero carbon emissions on 13 October 2022 but this does not address wider district carbon emissions.\nThe UK Parliament and approximately 300 Local Authorities (75%) have declared a climate emergency (LGA,2022)\nBiodiversity is essential both to humans, through the provision of ecosystem services such as food, fuel, flood prevention and enjoyment; and in its own right as part of the natural world.\nBiodiversity is under severe threat. Nearly 500 species have become extinct in England in the last 200 years, 40% of the UK’s reedbeds have disappeared since 1945, 75% of England’s lowland heaths have been lost in the last 200 years, nearly 50% of England and Wales’ ancient woodland has been destroyed and current rates of extinction may be 1,000 times greater than global natural background levels. (Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership).\nThe Environment Act 2021 set out the importance of biodiversity net gain, an approach to development that aims to leave the natural environment in a better state than it was beforehand, together with a stronger legal duty for public bodies to conserve and enhance biodiversity.\nActions to restore nature and biodiversity are vital for their own sake, and increase storage of carbon, helping to address climate change. Climate change and the loss of biodiversity will change the future for humanity and should be considered in conjunction with each other.\nMotion\n1) Council recognises the dangerous and accelerating effects of unmitigated climate change and ecological destruction for Norfolk.\n2) Council resolves to declare a Climate and Biodiversity Emergency.\n3) Council resolves to take action accordingly within the limits of its resources and powers and report back annually on progress.",

A total of 24 Greens are to stand in the Broadland District Council elections.\nThe local Green Party also called for Broadland council and the government to sign up to a new Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter to beat the housing crisis and ensure green spaces are protected.\nWhen you vote Green on Thursday 4 May, you will help to elect hardworking councillors committed to making Broadland a fairer, greener community.\nWe need councillors and national government to work together to deliver the homes people need and can afford to rent and buy, where people need them.\nWhat we need is local councils supported to build quality, affordable housing in the right places where people live and work, with the right supporting infrastructure and local facilities.\nThe Green Party’s Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter will simultaneously protect valuable green space for communities, reduce climate emissions, tackle fuel poverty and provide genuinely affordable housing.\nLocal communities in Broadland are facing the same problems as much of the rest of the country – developers being allowed to build houses local people often can’t afford and failing to ensure local services like buses and GP surgeries get the investment they need.\nThe Charter would also provide greater protection for renters.\nIn the short term, the Green Party would introduce an immediate rent freeze and eviction ban to prevent people being made homeless in the middle of this cost of living crisis, as the Scottish Greens have already done as part of the Scottish Government.\nIn the longer term, the Green Party would give councils the power to bring in rent controls in areas where the housing market is overheated. We would also place much stricter controls on the type of new homes being built to include more affordable and social housing for buying and renting.\nEveryone deserves a place that they can call home. That is why the Green Party’s Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter will deliver the change we want to see across the housing sector and create fairer, greener communities.",

Eleanor polled over 700 votes well above Labour (579) and the Liberal Democrats (197). Focussing our campaigning shows that when we get our message out people are willing to vote for Green policies.\nCandidates also improved on the Green Party core vote notably in Blofield & Brundall and Reepham divisions and came third in seven of the eleven divisions contested.\nThe Green Party won back three county council seats to be represented at County Hall once again.

In Broadland, we are campaigning for Norfolk County Council to adopt the following priorities:\n1. Green Jobs – retrofit houses to lower carbon consumption and enhance resilience to our changing climate. Install solar panels, insulation and air source heat pumps to create thousands of jobs across Norfolk.\n2. Universal Basic Income – in the wake of the pandemic, more than ever, a universal basic income is needed to support people whose incomes have been adversely affected.\n3. A Carbon Budget – the county council should measure the carbon cost of all its activities as a first step to cutting the amount of carbon it is responsible for releasing. Only with accurate data can the council cut its carbon emissions effectively.\n4. Responsible Waste Disposal Without Incineration – None of the county’s waste should be incinerated as it is now. Greens would radically overhaul waste management, cutting waste at source and providing re-use and repair facilities at every recycling centre in Norfolk.\n5. Traffic-free Clean Air Zones Outside Schools – Clean air is vital for healthy growing children. Every child should also have a safe journey to school. A county-wide travel plan for schools is essential.\n6. No New Road Building – Greens would improve public transport and demand cleaner buses. Greens do not support the building of new major roads, such as the Norwich Western Link Road, saving the money that would be wasted on such a vanity project, while protecting Norfolk’s unique wildlife. New roads cannot be built if we are to meet C02 emissions targets.\n7. Additional Funding for Adult Social Services to Combat Drug Abuse – drug addiction should be treated as a health issue, not a criminal offence.\n8. Mental Health – positive mental health can be nurtured through greater community engagement and activities supported at a community level to boost the wellbeing of local residents.",

The political make up is: Greens (4), Labour (8), Liberal Democrats (14), Conservatives (21).\nIn some councils in no overall control, the largest party can form an alliance with another party. The Greens will not be forming an alliance with the Conservatives, and we cannot see the Lib Dems and Labour doing that either.\nThat leaves the Liberal Democrats to form some kind of alliance or coalition with Labour and potentially the Greens.\nLabour has announced they will be holding a meeting on Saturday 13th May to select their Group Leader and so we hope to understand how they are thinking soon after that.\nWe look forward to speaking with the Lib Dems and Labour in the next few days.\nFinally, we were invited to a meeting of Group Leaders from both South Norfolk and Broadland Councils and, like the Lib Dems and Labour, we declined the meeting as we do not support a merger of the two councils.",

Since 2008, the RSPCA has run its PawPrint Award scheme for local authorities, recognising good practice and outstanding animal welfare concerning stray dogs and their owners from Local authorities in England and Wales. There are three levels for the award: Bronze, Silver and Gold, each level carrying progressively more demanding criteria. The awards recognise local councils who have clear procedures in place ensuring the welfare of all stray dogs and who show a clear consistency of service. It also recognises and rewards local authorities that put animal welfare first, reducing long-term straying and providing help, education, and advice, to owners. Cllr Keith Kiddie, South Norfolk Council’s Cabinet Member for Cleaner, Safer Environment said:\n“Receiving this award for the fourth year in a row is a proud achievement for us and demonstrates that our Animal Warden Services consistently goes above and beyond to ensure that dogs and their owners are reunited.”\nJan Davis, Broadland District Council’s Cabinet Member for Environmental Excellence, said:\n“This Gold award is testament to the quality of our Animal Warden Service and their continuous hard work on behalf of the Council.

With the right funding and determination, such a scheme could start to help people from this winter.\n“Even with a lower price cap, bills are still higher than before the energy crisis and are likely to remain high for the future.\n“Figures released earlier this week suggested that almost half of all British households – 13m homes – said they did not turn on their heating when it got cold last winter [2].\n“The average home could save hundreds of pounds a year with decent insulation [3] and the government needs to support councils to reach them as soon as possible\n“Insulating people’s homes means they can stay warm while using less energy,savemoney and produce fewer harmful carbon emissions.\n“A mass programme of government-backed, council delivered home insulation starting before winter is a win-win solution for people and the planet.\n“Government support should extend an emergency grant to homeowners and landlords aiming urgent support at those most in need.\n“And it is well beyond time to break the link between electricity and gas prices that so distorts the market that it pushes up electricity prices for the public even as cheaper renewable electricity sources could be pushing prices down.\n“We have the opportunity now, starting with support for the most at-risk people, to create warmer, more comfortable homes and in the process create millions of jobs, reduce bills and cut carbon emissions.”\nNotes\n1\nhttps://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/energy-prices-fall-again-winter\n2\nhttps://www.which.co.uk/policy-and-insight/article/too-scared-to-put-the-heating-on-13-million-households-not-heating-their-homes-when-its-cold-due-to-energy-bill-fears-which-warns-aXpY84U6BJaS\n3\nhttps://www.renewableenergyhub.co.uk/main/insulation/insulation-cost-and-savings",

The rules prevent local authorities giving the go-ahead to new developments that are projected to add to river nutrients such as phosphates and nitrates, either through wastewater from new homes or run-off from building sites.\nRamsay said:\n“It is beyond credulity that the government’s answer to dealing with our toxic rivers is to water down regulations and allow even more filth to flow into them. There’s a risk that scrapping nutrient neutrality rules will result in the complete ecological collapse of our waterways.\n“Rather than weakening regulation we need firmer controls on private water companies and hugely profitable housebuilders. The Green Party would do this by taking water companies into public ownership, ending the siphoning off of profits to shareholders and investing instead in cleaning up our act. We’d also have a clear focus on affordable, high quality and environmentally friendly homes, by investing in a large scale council house building programme.\n“The government’s reckless actions once again put the spotlight on Labour.

They are to ‘keep 1.5 alive’; an agreement on the fair and managed phase-out of all fossil fuels; and measures to address ‘climate inequality.’ Greens are challenging the UK government to lead by example and put into practice policies that will help meet these demands.\nCo-leader of the Green Party, Carla Denyer, said:\n“We need to hear a clear unambiguous commitment from the UK government to the 1.5C Paris Agreement target which was signed up to by 196 countries eight years ago at COP21. The government must agree to whatever it takes to get this target back on track. It’s going to require a hugely ambitious strategy, but the massive scaling up of climate action that is now necessary is because of dither and delay by countries like the UK in taking the bold action needed.\n“Another vital outcome of COP28 must be the fair and managed phase-out of all fossil fuels. As one of the rich countries most responsible for the climate crisis, the UK must stand on the side of future generations and those on the front line of climate breakdown and agree to urgently move away from fossil fuels. The UK government must resist pressure from the petrostates and others at COP who wish to continue with business as usual and keep the world hooked on fossil fuels. At home this means leading by example with an immediate end to all new oil and gas licences and a rapid acceleration towards renewable energy.\n“Thirdly, these climate talks must recognise that it is a super-rich elite who are super-heating the planet. The UK government must be willing to challenge the grotesque inequality driving climate breakdown and reform our tax system to make the polluter pay. This means taxing the wealth of the super-rich and introducing a carbon tax on the most polluting corporations and individuals. Such taxes, introduced globally, could generate the funds needed for a generous new Loss and Damage Fund to finance climate action in the poorest countries – those suffering the most from the impacts of climate breakdown but contributing the least to the crisis.”\nCo-leader Adrian Ramsay spoke to LBC News this morning on his hopes for COP28. He told listeners: “The world is heading for a hellish future… if we don’t step up this ambition and action and fast. But the other side of that coin is that we could be creating a much better and brighter future for people throughout the UK and around the world. … If we end up with a world where we’ve got safer streets, cleaner air, warmer homes, more jobs in renewable energy, support for our farmers producing more food locally, they will have created a better future for people and planet as well as addressing the biggest challenge facing humanity.\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

Our world needs climate action on all fronts: everything, everywhere, all at once.”\nResponding to the The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Synthesis Report released on Monday 20 March, Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green Party, said:\n“The IPCC paints a grim picture of the future if action to tackle the climate emergency isn’t taken immediately. They point to a small window of opportunity that governments still have to secure a liveable, sustainable future for all and limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C.\n“This report should be a loud alarm bell for the UK government, but it seems they’re just not listening. The Spring budget shows the Tories are asleep at the wheel when it comes to the climate crisis. Instead of investment in public transport and active travel, we got a fuel duty freeze; rather than meaningful investment in abundant and affordable renewables such as onshore and offshore wind, tidal and solar, we got the promise of expensive nuclear which will take over a decade to come on stream. And still no end in sight to the granting of licences for further fossil fuel exploitation or a carbon tax to make polluters pay for the damage they cause to our environment.\n“The IPCC calls for action on climate change that also provides wider benefits.

[2]\nCo-leader Adrian Ramsay, Parliamentary Candidate for Waveney Valley which includes much of the Mid Suffolk district, said:\n“We need councillors and national government to work together to deliver the homes people need and can afford to rent and buy, where people need them.\n“Today, speculators and developers are allowed to chase the biggest profits and ignore local needs. Too many villages and towns have seen large-scale developments take place without the community infrastructure expanded alongside, such as GP surgeries, bus services, cycling and walking networks and nurseries and schools.\n“What we need is local councils supported to build quality, affordable housing in the right places where people live and work, with the right supporting infrastructure and local facilities.\n“Our Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter will simultaneously protect valuable green space for communities, reduce climate emissions, tackle fuel poverty and provide genuinely affordable housing.\n“We’ve seen how Green councillors have made a difference in Mid Suffolk, where developers are now expected to provide EV points, not connect to the gas grid and provide heat pumps as standard.\n“The villages of Suffolk and Norfolk are facing the same problems as much of the rest of the country – developers being allowed to build houses local people often can’t afford and failing to ensure local services like buses and GP surgeries get the investment they need.\n“Developers are being allowed to ride roughshod over the needs of communities and the environment and this has got to stop.”\nCo-leader Carla Denyer, who is a serving councillor and Parliamentary candidate in Bristol, said:\n“Up and down the country, people are experiencing the same problems as people here in Stowmarket – homes that are unaffordable to buy, unaffordable to rent and unaffordable to heat. There is a generation of people who are trapped in the private rental market by spiralling rents that bear no relationship to incomes.\n“To address this, in the short term, we would introduce an immediate rent freeze and eviction ban to prevent people being made homeless in the middle of this cost of living crisis, as the Scottish Greens have already done as part of the Scottish Government.\n“In the longer term, we would give councils the power to bring in rent controls in areas where the housing market is overheated. We would also place much stricter controls on the type of new homes being built to include more affordable and social housing for buying and renting.\n“Everyone deserves a place that they can call home. That is why our Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter will deliver the change we want to see across the housing sector and create fairer, greener communities.”\nThe Greens’ Right Homes, Right Place, Right Price Charter would:\n- End the housing crisis by creating enough affordable homes – including 100,000 new council homes a year built to the Passivhaus or equivalent standard\n- Empower local authorities to bring empty homes back into use\n-\nTransform the planning system to:\n- Incentivise renovation and improvement of existing buildings to reduce the environmental impact of new construction\n- Incentivise local authorities to spread small developments across their areas, where appropriate, rather than building huge new estates\n- Protect valuable green space for communities\n- Require new developments to be accompanied by the extra investment needed in local services, such as providing extra school and GP places and better bus services\n-\nTransform building regulations to ensure:\n- all new private and public sector housing meets Passivhaus or equivalent standards\n- house builders include solar panels and heat pumps on all new homes.\n- Ensure all new developments will be located and designed to ensure that residents do not need cars to live a full life\n- Introduce rent controls\n- End no-fault evictions\nCouncillor Andy Mellen, leader of the Green councillors on Mid Suffolk District council, said: “Greens make a difference when elected. I want to see a stop to unplanned development. Instead, we need the delivery of truly affordable and sustainable homes, with the infrastructure provided so that the ‘liveability’ of our communities is improved.\n“These are the practical, radical solutions that Greens across the country are offering to implement if elected on 4 May.”\nCarla Denyer added:\n“This year’s local elections are a crucial step for the Greens as we look to not only defend hundreds of seats across the country but continue our unprecedented growth, breaking through on to new councils and gaining control of councils where we already have representation.\n“With the cost of living crisis, the climate crisis and more and more people looking for a fresh political voice, it has never been more important to get Greens elected.”\nAdrian Ramsay added:\n“Over the last few years, we have seen Green councillors elected in record numbers, winning seats from Labour and the Conservatives in roughly equal numbers, in rural and urban areas alike. We know that people like what they see.\n“That’s why we are fully expecting this growth to continue this year right across the country, be that in places like Lancaster and Lewes where we are already in administration, or Mid Suffolk where we could gain control of the local authority.” [3]\nNotes\n1. The number of households in England is projected to rise from 23.2 million in 2018 to 26.9 million in 2043 – an average increase of around 150,000 households per year. (ONS, Household projections for England, 2018-based: Principal projection dataset, 29 June 2020). According to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities’ ‘English housing survey 2021-22’, 4.6 million households (19%) rent privately; 4 million households (17%) rent from a social landlord, and 65% of households in 2021-22 were owner occupiers These comprised 35% who owned their home outright and 30% with a mortgage.\n3. Greens currently hold 12 seats on Mid Suffolk District Council and are the second largest party, with the ruling Conservatives on 17 seats. Greens could take control of Mid Suffolk on 4th May. Much of the Mid Suffolk District is in the new Waveney Valley Parliamentary constituency where Adrian Ramsay is standing as the Parliamentary candidate. Across Suffolk as a whole Greens hold 31 seats, nearly all of which have been won from the Conservatives..\n4. The Green Party currently has 563 councillors on 172 principal authority councils in England and Wales. It will be defending 281 seats in this year’s local elections in May and will be looking to make further gains across the country.",

The Green Party is contesting at least 10 seats in Broadland alone and many more across the county. An article in the Eastern Daily Press (31/03/21) makes the point that only the Greens have the ambition to drive carbon reduction. It lists Green proposals to make the county carbon neutral by 2030. This can be achieved at the same time as creating new jobs through, for example, retrofitting homes to cut carbon emissions.\nThe article highlights the Green Party objection to the Norwich Western Link, the controversial £153m road which would connect the Northern Distributor Road to the A47.\nOther pledges include the need to manage traffic around schools to reduce harmful pollution, the introduction of a universal basic income, the recycling of the county’s waste rather than incineration (which is currently what happens to a lot of our recycled waste), and increased funding for social services support for drug and mental health issues.\nBen Price, standing for the Thorpe Hamlet seat at County Hall, said: “The council would be richer for the Greens being there. Whereas other parties tinker around the edges to varying degrees, climate change is at the front and centre of our policies.”\nSee EDP24: https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/local-council/greens-hopes-for-norfolk-county-council-elections-7864342",

It’s straight out of an authoritarian playbook.\n“How can the Government claim an electoral mandate for these major changes if those most impacted see their elections cancelled?\n“The Green Party is urging the Government to protect democracy, allow these long-planned elections to take place and get around the table with elected representatives of all parties to discuss how to make devolution work for people in local areas across the country.\n“We want decisions closest to where they have the greatest impact with significant devolution of powers and funding from Westminster. That is the way to keep the vital connection between the politicians making decisions and those affected by them and avoid further alienation from the political process. The imposition of huge, remote councils against the will of local people would fly in the face of local democracy.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

Light pollution is of increasing concern locally as suburban areas are created via development on the outskirts of Norwich. Areas that were once rural agricultural landscapes are becoming industrial or residential areas with all that entails, and one of the consequences is excessive artificial light which floods our night sky.\nLight pollution reduces our view of space from Earth. It also has a detrimental impact on all living things by affecting circadian rhythms and altering behaviour. Excessive use of lighting is a waste of electricity, raising costs and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhatever can be done to make developments sensitive to these issues needs to be done, without compromising on safety. Light levels can be limited, timing of lighting can be controlled and light should be targeted effectively and shielded where appropriate. Certain types of light such as short wavelength blue-rich white light can have adverse effects and warm white light specifications should be used instead.\nModern technology ensures we have access to lighting control systems such as timers and motion sensors. Planning policies need to be fully utilised to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between our need for lighting and the need to protect our environment from light pollution.",

The company will provide a trading platform for nutrient offsetting and other environmental credits, including Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG).\nNutrient Neutrality has had an impact on many parts of the country. One of the most significantly affected areas is Norfolk where multiple Districts have been unable to grant planning permission for new homes for the last 18 months leading to a backlog. Concerns about the quality of our water and environment are rightly rising up the agenda and need to be addressed.\nThis is not the first environmental trading platform to be established but it is the first time that so many Councils have formed a trading company of this nature.\nNorfolk Environmental Credits is designed to secure largescale nutrient mitigation from projects such as changes in use of agricultural land, septic tank conversion and water infrastructure enhancements. These credits are then parcelled up by the company and sold to developers to offset the equivalent amount of nutrients arising from their new development.\nThe company’s business plan sets out the allocation policy for distributing credits across the four districts. It also sets out the initial credit price for nutrient neutrality which is currently the lowest price in the country and the money invested by the Councils in the land will be repaid by the sale of these credits to developers.\nNorfolk Environmental Credits has launched its new website allowing housing developers to calculate their additional nutrient load and register an interest in purchasing credits as they become available. The website also provides a mechanism for landowners and interested parties to come forward with potential nutrient mitigation solutions that the joint venture may wish to invest in.\nPromoted by Jan Davis, 21 Church Rd., Cantley, Norwich, NR13 3SN, on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales",

This means that councils have made £24.5 billion in service cuts and efficiencies over this period.\nLocal councils deliver a huge range of statutory services, from child protection to waste and recycling services and temporary accommodation. They are also uniquely placed for real action on achieving net zero and to protect and restore other services vital to health and wellbeing in the community such as sports, arts, leisure and green spaces.\nCaroline Topping, Green leader of East Suffolk Council, said:\n“As Green Party leaders of local Councils, we welcome the new government’s manifesto commitment to multiyear funding settlements and an end to wasteful competitive bidding, which has stressed already overstretched officer capacity and council resources. Even successful bids have often come with strings attached and time scales that hamper delivery. We expect and look forward to a completely new relationship which puts council funding on a secure and sustainable footing.”\nEllie Chowns, Green MP for North Herefordshire and former cabinet member for environment, economy and skills on Herefordshire Council, said:\n“After so many years of austerity, local councils absolutely need the funding to deliver those basic services which everyone uses. Getting the basics right at local level is essential for the government to deliver on bigger national plans.

So, how can East Anglia mitigate its impact on climate change? “If our local authorities are really interested in cracking down on emissions, transport is where the biggest transformation must take place. “Transport pollution covers carbon dioxide emitting exhausts as well as particulate matter from tyres and brake dust, which can cause asthma. It can also affect the cognitive development of children and there’s evidence that it is related to the onset of dementia.”\n“Pollution from transport is so bad it is becoming an anti-social activity,” Asher says. “Think about how we travel and the effects on other people, including children – there’s nowhere more polluted than the cabin of a car during the school run.”",

Pushing for new oil and gas drilling licences is an act of environmental vandalism. Especially at a time when the country is reeling from hugely damaging storms and floods, which scientists warn will become more frequent, ferocious and destructive as our planet heats.\n“Encouraging energy giants to exploit fossil fuel reserves they then sell on the global market at global prices cannot provide either security or cheaper energy bills. Even the government’s own Energy Security, Claire Coutinho, had to admit that the government’s plan to require annual oil and gas licensing in the North Sea offers no guarantee of keeping energy bills down.\n“Energy security, addressing high energy bills and reducing emissions will only come from ramping up cheaper and abundant renewable resources such as solar and onshore wind together with a mass home insulation programme.\n“With the Conservatives now looking increasingly like a zombie government today is a big challenge for Labour. Will they pledge to undo the damage inflicted on the climate by the Conservatives today and commit to not a single new oil and gas licence from day one of a Labour government?\n“What is clear, is that whoever forms the government after the next general election, Green MPs are going to be needed to push for legislation that will lead to a greener and fairer country.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ",

Instead of allocating the revenue from DHSC to support the restoration of Postwick P and R, it was used to fund the operation of other Norwich Park and Ride sites.\nA temporary service was reinstated which ran from 21 November to 24 December 2022. Despite an initial indication from both NCC and the operator that it would serve as a pilot for permanent re-opening, it received minimal advertising despite the service having been closed for so long, the running hours were not appropriate for commuting workers, the route was altered to provide no intermediate stops and Parish Councils were notified a couple of days later that NCC intended to close the service.\nNCC said following questioning that the re-opening was not a trial and the intention was to enable shoppers to access the city during the festive period (rather than offering a viable service for those working in the city). NCC still maintains that this may be a temporary closure if it can be proven that passenger numbers will recover. It has not been made clear however, how this can be evaluated while the service ceases to run.\nA Freedom of Information request to NCC admitted that a business plan for the temporary re-opening of the park and ride with a range of costed options together with short and long term forecasts had not been produced.\nWe, the undersigned would like to see the reinstatement of the Postwick P and R service for the following reasons:\nResidents will use a bus service if it is convenient, comfortable and financially advantageous for them to do so. The service could be altered to include key stops including the Broadland and Broadland Gate Business Parks, Norwich and Norfolk University hospital and the University of East Anglia. This service has been closed, blaming residents for a failure to use it, rather than considering other more viable and imaginative business options.\nThe surrounding area is marked for significant growth both in terms of housing and business development. P and R services reduce congestion in cities and carbon emissions. A failure to reopen the service will cause the opposite to happen. Little is being done in Broadland to offer serious and practical alternatives to car use on the scale that is required to achieve the government’s Net Zero targets.\nThe population East of Norwich is expanding and will continue to do so. Approximately 100,000 people live in the Great Yarmouth district and closures of retail outlets and employment centres in that area make Norwich the main business centre, resulting in significant traffic coming into Norwich. Norwich City Council’s policies aim to reduce traffic entering the centre and removal of a Park and Ride service east of the city runs contrary to that.\nReinstatement of the service, together with extensive advertising, would help mark the reversal of the pattern we see of rural communities in the East gradually losing key infrastructure services due to lack of investment.\nYours faithfully\nPostwick Parish Council\nFreethorpe Parish Council\nReedham Parish Council\nOrmesby St Margaret with Scratby Parish Council\nBrundall Parish Council\nAcle Parish Council\nBeighton Parish Council\nStrumpshaw Parish Council\nBlofield Parish Council\nCantley Parish Council\nLingwood and Burlingham Parish Council",

An amendment was made to Clause 16 of the deal, to defer or stop the transfer of District Council activities to the County Authority. The deal was ratified on 17 January 2023 and a 6-week consultation began on 6 February. If the deal is agreed, the first election for a directly-elected leader would be in May 2024. However, there is not universal support for the County Deal and even within the Conservative controlled councils there is disquiet among Conservative councillors. As your Green Party district councillors we are opposed to the Deal on several counts which include the following:\n- The Norfolk County Deal is not the right type of devolution for Norfolk because the funding on offer, £20 million per year for 30 years, is not going to deliver the level of change that would be required from such a deal.\n- To put the funding on offer into perspective, the County Council is having to make £60 million of cuts this year, much of it from Adult and Children’s services.\n- Enhanced housing and land acquisition powers are included in the Deal. Funding is earmarked for growth and development with an additional £5.9 million of capital funding in this Spending Review period to support the delivery of housing. We do not see continued growth with harmful large-scale housing developments at all sustainable. We would rather see the funding ring-fenced for a green transition of the economy.\n- A directly elected leader cannot be held accountable in the way that a leader of a council can be held accountable by fellow councillors. It is an erosion of local democracy.\n- Some of the funding provided will be for district council services but the county council will be able to determine how the funds are spent. This is the beginning of the erosion of the role of district councils.\n- The government has said that “this agreement is the first step in a process of further devolution”. “Further powers may be agreed over time and included in future legislation”. This process is a slippery slope to even more central control through a single elected leader.\n- The Greens, and others, have called for a referendum on the Deal but this has been refused which, again, undermines local democracy.\nThe Consultation ends on 20 March 2023 and any resident can respond on the following link:",

What is the point of spending a huge amount of time and effort on developing local plans with residents and parish councils when they can be by-passed by a few Conservative councillors on the planning committee? All the local parish councils in the area were against the development. It included the carrot of a medical centre but it is in the wrong place on the edge of Rackheath down a narrow lane with minimal access to public transport. Someone, somewhere, is making a tidy profit from this development at the expense of our green spaces and all the time infilling between our Broadland villages. Shameful decision.",

Government recognised, accepted, then rejected the urgent call to reduce carbon emissions. Amid chaotic internal battles, funding influences led policy back to fossil fuel expansion: coal, gas prospecting, carbon storage and road building. Growth projects’ costs escalated, leaving essential services on life support. Do stressful working conditions support long-term productivity and profit? Are the non-employed slacking or suffering? Should authorities contract out essential services to agencies which profit, exploit data, and intentionally degrade services, wages, and conditions? Shouldn’t the civil service and the NHS model good employment practice? Could Britain be more secure if infrastructure and utilities were publicly owned, controlled, and maintained locally, incidentally relieving householders from managing tricksy ticketing and contracts. Regulated, properly funded local government can organise effective social care, health care, public safety and hygiene, education, public transport, and utilities. Paying Council tax, National Insurance, and fair, progressive Income tax rates saves money. We shouldn’t need so many charities supplementing essential services. Which Party would be most collaborative in strategising for this resource-depleted, consumption driven nation? Which will futureproof our failing infrastructure and help children and adults to be resilient, self-reliant, and involved? We live in increasingly hostile, confusing, competitive times of hazard and wars. What happens elsewhere impacts Britain. Climate emergencies happen here. It’s not ‘growth’ and more ‘stuff’ that increases security. Thousands of citizen protesters strive daily to be heard in policy making but are ridiculed and criminalised. Let’s value scientists like Dr Andrew Boswell, and conservation work by Natural England, CPRE, Friends of the Earth, The Norfolk Wildlife Trust (Sweet Briar Marshes), and community organisations like Mile Cross Green Hearts. They operate to advise and support progressive adaptation. ‘Restore Nature Now‘ reflects the desperation of people up and down the country. 150 plus groups who support urgent action to address wildlife decline, pollution, carbon emission and climate resilience, will meet in London next month, June 22nd.

Crucially, we need to see the Government make investment choices that result in households benefiting financially from climate action too – both by ensuring everyone can access renewables and energy efficiency and because they are paying lower bills. The public are clear that they want to see the worst climate polluters pay, and we need to make sure that the costs of climate action never fall on those least able to afford it.\n“A thriving green economy is also vital if we are to prevent climate deniers, like Reform, from weaponising the mass destruction of climate chaos. Instead, we must help the most vulnerable and build resilience in communities to adapt to climate breakdown.”\nHe continued: “Without an immediate acceleration of climate ambition, our economy, national security and environment are all at serious risk. That’s why we are disappointed not to see the CCC go even further on measures to reduce energy demand. In the face of impending airport expansion decisions by this Labour government, more ambitious policy is urgently needed to keep the aviation sector in check. Their advice shows strong public support for limiting airport expansion and introducing a frequent flier levy where the small percentage of the population who take the vast majority of the flights have to pay more .\n“The CCC have shown that a positive, fairer, jobs-rich, greener future is possible, and they have set a clear pathway for the Government to follow. Now, we need the Government to step up, stop the vested interests who are intent on delaying, and show the ambition and leadership this moment demands.”\nPromoted by Jan Davis on behalf of Broadland Green Party, a constituent party of the Green Party of England & Wales PO Box 78066, London, SE16 9GQ\nNotes",

Sadly it appears that this was not a one off event. In the same week, hundreds of dead fish were found floating on the surface of the River Cam, and similar events were reported by the local press in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Cheshire, Yorkshire and Kent.\nThe most likely cause given by the Environment Agency was a low level of dissolved oxygen in the water due to hot weather, in conjunction with thunderstorms which lower atmospheric pressure. Heavy rainfall also flushes high levels of nutrients into river water which cause proliferation of algae and cyanobacteria, also lowering oxygen levels.\nIt is distressing to witness such events, but they are likely to become more common as the climate warms and are a warning sign. We can all do something positive to address the climate and biodiversity crisis, and it is incidents such as these that remind us there is no time to waste.\nKind RegardsEleanor Laming",
