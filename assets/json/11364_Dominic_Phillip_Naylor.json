Pull out that thread and the fabric of the nation unravels.\nWe are a people with a strong sense of fair play and social justice. An instinct to protect the environment for future generations.

By releasing information of our own we can highlight matters of public interest that ministers would rather people didn't know about.\nWith parliamentary scrutiny so feeble, the media has become a surrogate debating chamber. And when dealing with an administration legendary for its secrecy, you increasingly have to rely on whistle-blowers to see the full picture.\nDamian Green's arrest now threatens that ability, especially if MPs can no longer act as he did, without fear of the police knocking on their doors to rifle through their possessions and search their offices. Then yet more scrutiny will be lost.\nWe are made no safer by this arrest and the country will not be run any better. The door to proper public scrutiny of what the Government does in our name will have been closed a bit further, and the small shaft of light that still shines on the work of ministers will have narrowed even more.\nIt's the kind of behaviour we might expect to see in a tinpot dictatorship, not in a modern democracy.\nThe handling of this case raises a number of questions that demand answers as soon as possible.\nThe Metropolitan Police says that neither the search nor the arrest were conducted under the provisions of anti-terrorism legislation. Yet nine counter-terrorism officers were required to carry out the arrest of a middle-aged Conservative MP.\nThe Government has dismissed concerns that counter-terrorism laws can be misused. But time and again we have seen examples of powers that were rushed through Parliament being misused against people for crimes such as heckling Labour ministers at conferences or freezing Icelandic bank accounts.\nEven if these laws were not invoked this time, the sight of anti-terrorist police enforcing laws unrelated to terrorism will only confuse the public further.\nThe Home Office's most senior civil servant, Sir David Normington, has confirmed that he was contacted by the police just before they carried out their searches, and that ministers didn't know about the arrest until after it had occurred some time later.\nBut we need to know what happened in the hours between Sir David being told and Damian Green's arrest. Were Home Office ministers really not aware that a senior opposition MP was about to be raided by police?\nThere is an extra detail to this case that is also troubling for MPs, who play an important role in their constituencies as recipients of a lot of personal information. The basis of the relationship between an MP and a constituent is trust and confidentiality.\nMPs take up the cases of constituents on the understanding that they will treat information given to them sensitively.\nThe sight of police rifling through boxes of Mr Green's correspondence, through disc after disc of computerised information, will erode public confidence in the role MPs play in their communities. All at a time when confidence in politicians is already at an all-time low.\nSurrounding all this is a whiff of hypocrisy about New Labour departments in Whitehall clamping down on leaks to opposition politicians when ministers have elevated judicious leaking to the press to an art form.\nMPs have long got used to the depressing predictability of Sunday newspapers carrying intricate details of the latest government master plan before ministers have bothered to tell Parliament.\nAnd who can forget the way Labour politicians ruthlessly used leaks from Whitehall to damage the hapless Major administration before the 1997 general election? And guess who was the master at using those leaks most aggressively? Gordon Brown.\nThe Prime Minister must now do three things: he must clearly dissociate himself from the police operation altogether; he must clarify urgently what Home Office civil servants told ministers, and when; and he must instantly end his habit of leaking Whitehall information to secure favourable headlines for his own Government, while ministers now stand idly by as an opposition MP is arrested for seeking to bring Whitehall information to light in the first place.\nOur political system is already in deep trouble: sinking public confidence in MPs, feeble parliamentary scrutiny, a rigid culture of Whitehall secrecy, and an electoral system that hands unprecedented powers to governments freed from any meaningful scrutiny from other parties.\nThis unprecedented arrest is a wake-up call. We must save our broken democracy.\nNick Clegg MP",

The fly tips were feet apart from one another and posed a huge risk to drivers, especially in dark conditions or if wind blew the rubbish into the middle of the road. The fly tips included chairs, house-hold rubbish, a small sofa, a small mattress and planks of wood.\nThe fly tips were reported by Local Councillor Brenner Munden and will be followed up to make sure they are quickly cleared up and removed.\nThe Liberal Democrat group completely condemn all fly tips and the Joint Administration are committed to improving local Council services to ensure fly tips are quickly removed and fly tippers are prosecuted. Officers at the council have the ability to try and find out the source of the fly tip by going through the waste in order to prosecute the offender. The newly formed Clean and Green Committee are looking into ways to improve services at the Council including new and cost-effective ways to prevent fly tips and speed up the removal process. It can be frustrating seeing fly tips pollute our borough but rest assured the Administration is working hard to cut the number of fly tips and relieve the financial burden on local tax payers.\nLocal Councillor Munden says “for too long the villages around Brentwood have suffered from fly tips. We want to make sure our countryside remains clean and protect our environment. The council officers under previous administrations were over-stretched and I therefore welcome the focus of our newly formed Clean and Green Committee on fixing our fly tip problem”.\nIf you come across any fly tips yourself you can report them via the Brentwood Council Website, but please also contact your local councillor so the fly tip can be referred by the ward member and chased up in a timely manner.",

This tree forms part of a row of oak trees that have lined Priests Lane for nearly two centuries.\n“Decimating nature in this way is not acceptable. You cannot replace 200 years of nature”, says Liberal Democrat Councillor for Shenfield David Worsfold.\n“We do not accept the excuses of Cala Homes and Essex Highways for this act of environmental vandalism. The entrance is easily wide enough if designed sensitively and there are many ways of protecting tree roots during construction now so that this is not necessary”, he added.\nCllr Worsfold ran the girls football club on the Ursuline Playing Fields for many years before it was forced off when the Ursuline Order decided to sell it for development. He knows the site better than anyone.\n“Cala Homes have not clearly demonstrated that they own the tree which is largely on the neighbouring property. They haven’t had the courtesy to consult with the owner before going public with their plan to cut it down.\n“Losing the tree would be a major blow to our ambition to achieve at least a 20% net gain in biodiversity when major sites like this are developed.\n“I have tried engaging with the developers about the need to preserve this tree but they are just not interested in working with us and the local community.”\nCounty Councillor Barry Aspinell said developers have to do better in protecting the environment and working with local communities.\n“We know we need more homes and we support that. But they must be the right homes in the right places and must be sustainable. That means they must respect and protect what we have, especially our natural environment. Cutting down well-established trees that are such an obvious feature of the area is not the way to do that.”\nCllr Worsfold added that here are some tough conversations ahead about the development proposals.\n“I would have loved the playing fields to have been retained and developed as a community asset but that argument was lost when the Tory Local Development Plan was approved.\n“The original proposal for 45 homes was increased during the Local Plan process to 75 and now we are faced with an application for 96. This is clearly far more than the area can cope with. The implications for the local roads are horrendous. It an over-development and needs to be scaled back.\nThe Liberal Democrats are pledged to work with local residents and the Priests Lane Neighbourhood Residents Association to ensure that residents’ voices are heard loud and clear during the planning process.",

But we must recognise that it has transformed the context within which transport operates. We welcome the recent announcements made by the Government and supported by the County Council that seeks to develop a sustainable travel recovery. We welcome the fact that money is being brought forward to allow transport authorities to prioritise sustainable modes of transport. The measures must combine social messaging and physical measures to:\n- Enable social distancing to occur when people return to work or start to use shopping and retail centres again. Presently our pavements and cycleways are too narrow to allow this whilst conversely our road systems are mainly empty or have dramatically less traffic.\n- Enable safe use of transport systems generally. There has been a noticeable increase in vehicle speeds for example making pedestrian and cycle use less safe and perceived to be so increasingly.\n- Assist as far as possible the reintroduction of bus and rail services in a way which promotes their safe usage.\n- Ensure that traffic levels do not increase to the extent that they inhibit the movement of people, goods and services through increased congestion, pollution and carbon emissions.\n- Use the opportunity of disruption to increase on a permanent basis the amount of sustainable travel to bake in the long-term benefits to health caused by reduced air pollution and increase in physical activity.\nThe challenges include:\n- Whilst maintaining social distancing providing sufficient space on the highway for walking and cycling as an alternative means of travel, particularly in our key towns which avoids pinch-points which funnel people too closely together.\n- The need for key workers and those that must use cars to access workplaces safely when public transport services are reduced.\n- Enabling safe use of passenger transport, following government guidelines and working with bus operators to provide a safe service which has public confidence.\n- Continuing to support vulnerable people who are unable to leave their homes, many are now relying on the council and other agencies to provide them with essential supplies.\n- Support for local businesses who may struggle to survive and will need to find new ways to reach their customers, either through efficient deliveries or through safe access.\nTraffic levels are currently around 40% of their usual levels on both urban and interurban roads. It is likely that the public will feel safer travelling in their own cars when restrictions are eased, without measures to address the challenges highlighted above.\nUnless action is taken, there could be a double whammy of increased traffic and congestion, which could limit the recovery of the bus system and not provide adequate physical distancing space in town centres.\nIt is important that we continue to enable compliance with government guidance on social distancing to reduce virus transmission. The need for distancing is likely continue well into the future or until other tools become available. As restrictions ease, trips will increase. Journeys both on public transport and by road need to be managed to ensure physical distancing requirements are maintained, safety is enabled on footways to allow pedestrians safe passing. It is preferable to maintain low levels of private motor vehicle traffic in urban areas, so that walking and cycling can continue to be a realistic safe choice for shorter journeys.\nRecovery Opportunities\n- Encouraging as many people as possible to continue to work from home as much as they can. We can support businesses as part of the transition to the new normal\n- Developing a positive legacy for those who have become more active during lockdown.Embedding \"good behaviour\"; daily walk or cycle for health, walking to the local shop.\n- Build upon the air quality message, improved air quality has been noticeable.\nWhat Can Be Done in Brentwood?\nThere are a number of measures which can be introduced including:\n- Creating temporary walking space on roads by coning off all (or part of) the inside lane, or on single lane roads by narrowing the carriageway.\n- Creating temporary cycling space on roads.\n- Expands the public realm on a trial basis as part of innovate, test and learn.\n- Removing lanes for motor traffic\n- Creating waiting areas on shopping streets\n- Removing through motor traffic from residential streets to allow people to walk in the street with greater safety.\n- Amending pedestrian and cyclist pushbuttons at signalled crossings wait times reduced to\nWe hope that Brentwood Council will be able to engage with Essex County Council as the Highway Authority and at a National Level to bring about improvements to the sustainable transport infrastructure in the Borough.",

Paid parental leave will give both parents in Brentwood an opportunity to spend meaningful time with their newborn baby during those precious first months.\"\nNick Clegg said, \"Britain is a long way off becoming a child-friendly country.

Only a few months ago, bookings were being taken six months in advance, which makes it virtually impossible to book the hall for a wedding or major event, and now this has been reduced to three.

If the move gets planning permission, which is likely as the deal has already been struck and the planning committee has a higher number of the ruling Conservative councillors, the proposed location of disabled car parking spaces will see wheelchair users and those with mobility problems having to walk to the High Street through a narrow street (Crown Street) that struggles to accommodate pedestrians and cars safely with bollards having been knocked down by speeding motorists in the past.\nIn addition, the new spaces are not going to offer the safety of a purpose built car park with wide spaces - that will now be enjoyed by Barclays' staff.\nWhat's more worrying is that Brentwood Council tweeted the fact that the move will happen before any consultation has taken place with local residents or disability groups or the matter has been debated at Planning Committee - as is required when councils make applications on their own land. The information tweeted is also incorrect as it is double the distance!\nBrentwood North ward councillor James Sapwell said:\n\"This is a classic example of the Tory council disregarding views by firing first and then embarking on a consultation later, as we have come to expect. The council has not followed its own procedures by conducting a full disability impact assessment and has found itself in a total mess here with vulnerable residents very concerned about the situation.\n\"Why do we have to relocate our disabled residents' car parking anyway? It seems a much more logical solution to move Barclays staff car park without causing such upheaval. It seems Brentwood Council is putting Barclays' demands above the needs of our disabled residents and this is unfair and unnecessary.\nThe Liberal Democrat group has asked for a full disability impact assessment and consideration to be given to the logistics of each route for a disabled person to be examined.\nCllr Sapwell continued:\n\"It would just make more sense if the Conservative administration and Barclays Bank reconsidered their plans and put the needs of disabled and vulnerable residents first.\"",

All this time we have been waiting to find out what options residents would be offered to help try and reduce the noise. Now the Highways Agency say the noise isn't bad enough for reduction measures to be introduced and we aren't going to get anything.\"\nCouncil officers have also been unable to understand the actions Defra have taken and noted, in an email to councillors, that:\n- Defra appear not to have used any scientific assessment to determine what measures are appropriate\n- All of the assessments have been done on a desk-top basis with no site visits or real data to justify the results (even though they were provided them with the information we had obtained)\n- The council was hoping for a solution which would improve the noise climate in the vicinity rather than relying on an existing low-noise surfacing which was already in place when we made the measurements and in any event is only expected to provide a 1-2dB reduction over normal surfacing, which to the human ear is not normally discernible.\n- There appear to be no proposals to improve exposure to A12 road traffic noise.\nThe Liberal Democrat councillors have asked for the matter to be discussed at the next Environment Panel, hoping that a strong message can be sent from the council on this matter.",

Many have been left unrepaired for months and others have been poorly patched up only to open up again a few weeks later. These potholes are causing a serious danger to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians and have caused thousands of pounds of damage to vehicles and bikes.\nWe all pay a lot of money in Council tax to Conservative controlled Essex County Council but they have openly said that filling potholes is not a priority. The County Council has admitted it is running a policy of managed decline on it's roads. Even at current levels Essex Highways are investing less than half the amount required just to stand still. The value of annual deterioration, is modelled at £77.7 million across Essex. This is compared to Essex County Council's investment of £36.6 million per year to fix wear and tear issues like potholes.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for the Conservatives locally and nationally to make a significant investment in pothole repairs and for the quality of any repairs to be greatly improved.\nIn the recently announced annual survey of the state of the country's roads, the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) found that nearly 37,000 miles of road, that's 18%, were in poor condition and had less than five years of life remaining without intervention.\nThe report estimated that more than £14 billion was now needed to fix all of England and Wales' potholes and get the country's roads back up to standard. Last week as a part of his budget, Jeremy Hunt the chancellor, revealed that he would be providing an additional £200 million one-off payment to fix potholes on English roads. The funding was in addition to the Government's annual £500 million pothole fund. Whilst the £700 million is obviously welcome, years of underinvestment by the County Council and the Government is going to make it very difficult to ever bridge the gap.",

It will also have a very detrimental impact on many Brentwood businesses who have to operate with older vans.\n- ULEZ should not be expanded until residents in Borough's like Brentwood have full access to the car and van scrappage schemes that are currently offered to residents in the 32 London Boroughs\n- ULEZ should not be expanded until we have some serious investment in Brentwood's public transport, particularly in our local bus services.\nWe are determined to make a stand for Brentwood residents who will be directly affected by the ULEZ expansion. Whilst we all want to see cleaner air and less pollution the Mayor needs to seriously listen to peoples' genuine concerns and call a halt to his expansion plans now.\nAt the Ordinary Council meeting on 15th March Brentwood Conservatives moved a motion against the ULEZ expansion which completely failed to address the serious issues facing Brentwood residents if the expansion goes ahead as planned on August 29th.

This is in addition to the last budget that took nearly a million of the lowest income earners out of tax and made millions of hard working individuals £200 better off. We are making a real difference in people's lives - from the front page of our manifesto to people's back pockets.\nAlarm Clock Britain will be further helped by the measures we have taken to give motorists a fairer deal. We are shifting taxation away from the pumps and onto the broader shoulders of the oil companies instead - with fuel duty being cut and taxation on oil companies rising.\nAt the same time we are making the wealthy pay their fair share with increased measures to tackle tax avoidance, higher charges for non-doms and a special tax on private jets. This budget also places green growth front and centre - the Green Investment Bank will begin operation next year with £3bn of capitalisation, delivering an additional £18bn of investment in green infrastructure by 2014-15.\nWe were left a toxic economic legacy by Labour with a record deficit and debt. Under Ed Balls Labour have no answers and solutions to the mess they left. The difficult decisions we have taken in government have rebuilt confidence in Britain's ability to pay its way, kept interest rates lower than they would otherwise have been, and have provided the stability that business and individuals need to invest in the UK's economy.\nThere are no easy decisions in this budget.

This marriage of inconvenience involving the appointment of the Essex county chief executive also as chief executive of Brentwood council might bring into play conflicts of interest in which the larger partner would likely prevail. This experiment could go badly wrong.\nIn the late Eighties and early Nineties, Brentwood was involved in negotiations with other local districts to form a unitary authority. In order not to lose its identity, Brentwood council applied to the Queen for borough status. A charter was granted and the council appointed its first mayor.\nAmalgamation with Basildon district was not favoured by the public. In the end the Government decided to make only Southend and Thurrock into unitary authorities. Brentwood was to remain proudly independent.\nTo be 'tacked on' to a larger authority like Essex is a very doubtful blessing. This happened in the earlier days of the National Health Service when Brentwood was tacked on to the large London boroughs of Barking and Havering to form a health authority which was often felt to marginalise Brentwood and give it a poor deal. The health authority ran down and threatened the existence of the community hospital.\nBrentwood council spent a few millions of its own money in order to keep our local hospital open. Similar major conflicts of interest have arisen in the past with the county council over highways, public transport and the Leca landfill site.\nThe county council is run on very different lines to Brentwood. At county level, cabinet members make the decisions. In Brentwood, power still lies with individual councillors voting in committee. Brentwood's independence lies in the council's structure as well as in its borough charter.\nLet the people of Brentwood borough decide.\nDEREK HARDY\nLiberal Democrat member for Brizes and Doddinghurst Ward",

The bitterness and animosity has been there for all to see and there appears to be no end in sight.\nIt seems that whatever the odds stacked against her Cllr McKinlay is determined to try and hang on as Leader of a Conservative group that is deeply divided and at the same time continue being Leader of the Borough Council. While this sorry saga has been going on the local Conservatives seem to have almost forgotten that Brentwood still has a Council to run and that the Borough faces many serious issues that need to be addressed.\nI am very concerned that the Tory in-fighting is having a serious effect on the running of the Council, the morale of staff and how Brentwood is perceived by other Council's across Essex. The root cause of much of this unrest has been around the future of the Town Hall and the recent vote by eleven Tory rebels against the Leaders motion in July. As Leader of the Opposition I have not been impressed at all with Cllr McKinlay's handling of the Town Hall issue. If she had listened to early Lib Dem calls for more detailed costings on renovation and refurbishment it may well have saved the Council a lot of time and money. Sadly she chose to go on a different path and after spending £175,000 on consultants, losing the Town Hall vote and having major differences within her group we now find ourselves in the current situation.\nThe day after losing the Town Hall vote, Cllr McKinlay announced she was setting up a Town Hall Delivery Group with the task of trying to deliver the motion to save the building and retain it as the seat of local government in Brentwood. However the group's second meeting planned for 31st August was mysteriously cancelled by the Leader on officer advice five hours before it was due to begin. We now understand that the next meeting of the Town Hall Delivery Group will be on Monday 26th September. This will mean nearly a four week delay putting the process further back and wasting precious time and money.\nWhy was the meeting cancelled? Surprise surprise, there has been no announcement but the Lib Dems believe Brentwood residents deserve better. Going forward the Lib Dems have no particular interest in who is the Leader of the Conservative group but we do have a big interest in how the Borough Council operates and the quality of services it offers our residents.\nIn recent weeks it is quite obvious the Tory group have taken their eye off the ball and lost their focus on the issues facing our town. Just the other week only three Conservative members out of 28 bothered to turn up to an important officer presentation on the Traveller issue at Dale Farm. That would never have happened in the past.\nAt present the Tory group resembles a bunch of ferrets fighting in a sack with one of them coming up for air every now and again to make a comment to the press. Whilst at times it's almost been comical to watch for the sake of Brentwood's residents they need to get their differences resolved and get back to doing what they were elected to do which is to speak up and get things done for the residents who elected them.\nWhich is what the Liberal Democrats have been doing whilst the Tories have been fighting amongst themselves.\nCllr David Kendall\nLeader of the Liberal Democrat Group\nBrentwood Borough Counci",

There is a growth in pupil numbers in Brentwood and more places will be needed in the next few years so the County Council took the opportunity to apply for funding for this possible project along with others around the county. We are awaiting the outcome of these bids.. Due to the tight timescales involved and the timing of the process a consultation could not be conducted in advance of the bid being submitted, in the way we would normally progress such issues.\nIf the bid is successful the County Council will need to consider whether it wishes to proceed with this proposal. If it does it will be required to invite interest from 15 July in sponsoring the school as an academy. If the Council does not proceed then an alternative solution(s) to the need for places will need to be brokered with the local schools.\n<hr/ />\nTwo questions immediately leap to mind:\n1. Why does purdah affect decisions of this nature as this is County Council business, especially as purdah finished on 3rd May 2013.\n2. We need to ascertain why elected members are not consulted before action is actually sanctioned in their division, as is in this case, and establish the \"need\" for another school in Brentwood.\nTory-controlled Essex County Council has decided to bid for this government funding to the tune of £1.4M so that they can use the buildings under their ownership that are still remaining on the Sawyers Hall Lane and are currently unused by the Becket Keys school.\nIt seems to me that the County have seen a funding stream and are moulding a case around the need to access funds.

  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_the-shenfield-station-crossrail-riddle/content_409.html": "The Shenfield Station Crossrail Riddle\nSo here we are, Europe's largest construction project, a true engineering marvel that has a major interface landing here at Shenfield. As a visitor would you know? Of course, you wouldn't. Shenfield Station remains unchanged. Given the wear and tear of major construction happening, if anything the station and its surrounds are looking worse then it has over any point of the last 19 years that I have been using the station.\nPeople reading this will have their own opinions on Crossrail, a project that has been beset by problems. Whatever your thoughts, the project has largely been completed in terms of its Eastern tie in at Shenfield Station.\nGiven Shenfield is a landing for such a prestigious project it is a disgrace that our Conservative MP, Tory-controlled Brentwood Borough Council and similarly led Essex County Council have done nothing to the host stations in the borough, I'll include Brentwood Station within that statement. Despite the delays, Crossrail will at some point be up and running (latest communications states first half of 2022. Crossrail opens up new travel opportunities and we can expect new visitors to our town. Is Shenfield Station appropriate in terms of a 'first impression,' for anyone new to the area? I would argue strongly, no.\nThe project cost is in the region of £18 billion. £300 million has been paid as developer contributions. These are paid by Crossrail in order to mitigate the affects of the project on host local authorities. It doesn't look like Brentwood has been successful in accessing any of this funding.\nPrior to the Covid pandemic Shenfield Station had in the region of 4 million entries and exits at the station. This places it in the upper echelon for usage on stations outside of major metropolitan areas in terms of footfall. Again, the station and its surrounds are a poor advert for Brentwood at such a busy and dynamic hub.\nCompare and contrast the approach taken on the western interface at Maidenhead and the proactive approach of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM). There we see a local authority proud that it is hosting a project and have accordingly shown a degree of civic pride and is working to make the most of what is clearly seen as an opportunity. It's a rough and ready but running a search of 'Crossrail,' on Brentwood's and RBMW websites throws up an interesting comparison. When referencing Crossrail Brentwood talks about 'increased demands' and 'pressure.'RBMW is much more focused on opportunity. The station and its surrounds in Maidenhead are set for investment for upgrades in part leveraged by the opportunity of Crossrail. It is clear that Maidenhead will be using better connectivity as a major plus point as it seeks to draw business into the area.\nIt's not as if the issues with Shenfield Station aren't known. Plans were drawn up previously to prevent the mess that sees passengers exiting the building straight into a busy taxi rank and drop off road before they even get to the main road. It is well recognised that use of services is likely to receive a higher number of passengers and the current stops are inadequate. But no time has been invested in trying to resolve these matters and move forward with pulling together the funding to make the improvements.\nUsers of the Station deserve more. Residents of Shenfield deserve more. Journeys and overall travel experience have been hit by such a large engineering scheme. Ultimately Brentwood has missed the opportunity, again, to leverage in investment that could have been used to build a better first impression for visitors to our Town.\nIt is a continuing lack of civic pride.\nGary MacDonnell is Chair of Brentwood Liberal Democrats and our candidate for the 2021 Borough Council election for Shenfield Ward.

These include consulting on:\n- Changing the reference to catchment area within the assessment of entitlement to home to school transport policy and removing the use of joint catchment areas and instead only providing transport to the nearest school to the home address where statutory walking distances are met.\n- Removing existing transport from routes which are now deemed safe walking routes.\n- Withdrawing the provision of transport to families on low income whose children attend a selective grammar school.\n- Introducing a means tested assessment for transport provided to pupils in exceptional circumstances.\n- Introducing a new application window for Home to School ransport applications.\n- Reviewing existing post 16 transport provision\nUnder the County policy we have been told that the schools in Brentwood which will be considered to be the nearest to each of the villages are as follows:\n- Doddinghurst - Outings Lane CM15 OLZ would be Shenfield High School\n- Wyatts Green Road CM15 OPT would be Shenfield High School\n- Kelvedon Hatch - Great Fox Meadow CM15 OAU would be Becket Keys\n- Stondon Massey - Soames Mead CM15 OEP would be Shenfield High School\n- Blackmore - Woolard Way CM4 OQL would be Anglo European\n- Hook End - Hook End Road CM15 OHG would be Shenfield High School\nLib Dem County Councillor David Kendall said\n\"I have major concerns about this consultation because it could mean parents living in the rural areas having to pay out hundreds of pounds each year to send their child to the school of their choice when up to now it has been free.

It is due to be discussed on 9th October but councillors have been told that this will not be held in the public session of the Performance & Resources Committee.\nCllr Philip Mynott, Brentwood North, released the following statement:\n\"When Brentwood Tories' sudden determination to sell the Old House was discussed (twice, in January and March) behind closed doors at the council, the public were denied even a chance to see and hear what their elected representatives were saying about a building that has long been a precious public asset in the borough.\n\"They could not, therefore, hear the feebleness of the arguments put forward by the ruling Tory group for proposing this sale, or the strength of the counter arguments being made by Brentwood's Liberal Democrats (and all other opposition groups) against this proposal.\n\"Suffice it to say that the first decision by the Tories to sell this asset was made in the absense of the borough's senior finance officer having assessed the figures being quoted, and without the council having received the letter from English Heritage which laid out their response to various proposals on the building, whilst both decisons were made in the absence of any through structural survey having been done.of this precious feature of the town centre's historic fabric. In fact, English Heritage's letter on the Old House - which was only received on February 27th this year (over a month after the original Asset Panel decision - clearly states at one point that a final position on the possible conversion could not be taken \"until the entire building has been thoroughly surveyed\" (i.e. that, so far as English Heritage knew, it hadn't been \"thoroughly surveyed\" when they wrote it).\n\"So appalling were these closed-door proceedings that, during the second debate in March, an oppostion motion was put to postpone it for one week so that it could be held in public at Full Council; however every single Tory on the committee voted against this, preventing it from happening.\n\"Now that the final sale is to be discussed at the council's Performance and Resources Committee on 9th October the Tories intend that it will once again be with the public and press excluded from the chamber!\"\n\"That these decisions have ultimately led to the absurdity of Brentwood's Tory party twice deciding on the principle of sale without knowing exactly what the structural condition of the building was, is bad enough. That what was revealed about the building's state in those discussions clearly showed that its neglect under the Tory administration had reduced its value and damaged its good condition is almost as bad. Now, unless a proper structural survey has since been conducted by the council, it must now lead to the council discussing a final sale without knowing what it's selling (i.e. its real value), to an interested buyer who, doubtless, will have commissioned such a survey (in order to know exactly what it is that they are buying), which well illustrates how unreasoning this all is.\n\"Seemingly only Brentwood Tories can think that making the council, as vendor, (and thus the public purse) the victim of a backfiring pig-in-a-poke trick is a good idea\".",

Recently the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced the publication of a white paper on devolution of power across the country. In our area the Conservatives and Labour are using this review to put forward a proposal that South Essex Council's (including Brentwood) breakaway and form a combined authority with a directly elected Mayor. This move could see Brentwood in a new combined authority with Basildon, Thurrock, Rochford, Castle Point and Southend on Sea.\nBrentwood Liberal Democrat Councillors say……..\nWe do not believe the vast majority of Brentwood residents will want to be a part of a combined authority dominated by the likes of Basildon and Thurrock and with a Directly elected Mayor either now or in the future.\nWe do not believe a South Essex Combined Authority would reflect Brentwood's local identity or the interests of our community. We would become the junior partner in an organisation that has little in common with our area.\nWe do not believe it would be good for local democracy. The whole decision making process would become more remote and we would have to dance to the tune of a directly elected Mayor who quite possibly would have little knowledge and understanding of our Borough.\nIf Brentwood has to work with other authorities on Housing, Transport, the economy and planning we believe our community has far more in common with authorities such as Epping Forest, Chelmsford and even Colchester.\nIf you agree please sign our petition: www.handsoffbrentwood.info",
  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_planning-matters/content_528.html": "Planning Matters\nThere is much speculation in the media that the Conservative Government will make moves to change the current system around Planning Permissions. The clear inference drawn from rumours, noting that nothing official has yet been forthcoming, is that getting planning consent will become an easier and quicker process tied in with drive to get Britain building again. Bringing forward key large-scale developments and infrastructure works to operate as driving force in the post Covid 19 economic recovery.\nWe need to be careful. I'm in favour of investment in infrastructure. This country has ignored its infrastructure for too long. As a matter of principle, I also support large scale planned developments that bring with it the necessary infrastructure that all communities need - so called Garden Communities. Anything that allows an efficiency in bringing these types of developments forward should be discussed. However, the planning system exists to ensure that development is in the public interest, weighing up its economic, environmental and social benefits and drawbacks. It plays a key role in making sure the places where we live and work are attractive, vibrant and well designed.\nGood planning aids development by providing certainty. It is important that local residents and the wider community are given the full picture and understand what proposals involve and all of their affects. It creates better places. Well planned areas create more wealth then poorly planned. We can all point to poor developments that have been deeply unpopular and in worst cases have to be redeveloped soon after they've been built. Good planning and the outcomes of a working and transparent planning system are popular.\nWhat holds back the current planning can usually be traced to factors such as greed. As I write this the Secretary of State responsible for Planning (Robert Jenrick) is embroiled in controversy over a development he granted permission for, timed to avoid contributions back to the local authority, money that would have been invested in health care, schools and transport - investment to offset negative impacts of development on the local community. A hugely important part of a working planning system is that those financially benefitting pay to support local communities that don't. Other areas holding back development are related to profiteering such as prices and supply side matters are largely ignored.\nThe current planning system isn't perfect. What administrative system is? In my opinion where the current planning system falls is over long term planning looking over 15 years into the future. As it stands it tends to discourage transformative solutions as evidence is more difficult to produce. For long term infrastructure planning we need some form of long-term framework within which we can work; Regional Plans were one approach, another would be locally agreed non-statutory frameworks. Also, there needs to be a review on the amount and detail required in the myriad of documentation required as part of planning submissions. I see a lot of money producing products for planning, that go to consultancies but have little or no affect on either enabling others to understand the plan in question. A document produced at great cost that becomes a tick box exercise.\nThe planning system isn't perfect but get it wrong and there will be a backlash. A poor planning system without the right checks and balances could seriously undermine the government's economic ambitions as well as the climate change agenda. Happy for the government to review but tread carefully what is required is tweaking not wholesale rearrangement. Yes, lets get Britain building but continue to use the planning system to ensure it is the right type of building in the right places at the right time.",

I understand that the kitchen is no longer functioning and for some time it has badly needed refurbishment.\"\nThe Liberal Democrats have also campaigned against the closure of the Old House as this provides a much needed town centre facility. Cllr Chilvers added:\n\"A number of Old House users, including the very popular \"Learning for Pleasure\" for group, will find it difficult to fully relocate to Merrymeade House as many of their users rely on public transport to get them to their classes. The extra distance to Merrymeade is prohibitive, unless you have a car.\n\"There were a number of options for the refurbishment of this building and we suggested renting the upstairs rooms to small businesses and bringing the larger, downstairs meeting room up to a good standard and continue to make it available to community groups. Sadly, to no avail.\"\nHowever, it seems there may be a temporary reprieve for Keys Hall. Due to the economic downturn, there was very little interest in purchasing the area for re-development and the council has reverted to taking bookings six, rather than three, months in advance. The opportunity to re-develop the area will be given again once the economic situation starts to improve, despite the appeals of the Lib Dems.\nCllr Chilvers asked that, given that the economic situation will not be resolved quickly, that the hall is given a longer reprieve of 2-3 years, but the Conservative administration refused to consider a bookings period longer than six months. However, consideration will be improving the facility in the short term.",

So moved a motion at the ordinary council meeting to make Brentwood \"zero tolerance\", and to robustly enforce the law.\nThe action was supported by all councillors, and seconded by fellow blue badge holder and Conservative councillor 'Olivia Sanders'.\nNow there will be no tolerance of those getting a coffee or picking up their dry cleaning whilst using disabled bays in council areas, and private operators will also be asked to adopt the same approach.\nKaren said:\n\"Availability of disabled parking spaces for someone with mobility issues can mean the difference between them getting a pint of milk or having a social interaction that day or not. Disability can be extremely isolating, and as a society, we all need to recognise this, and allow those with challenges to lead a normal life, not block their access to goods, essential services, and a social life.\"\n\"I am delighted to have received such emphatic support from all councillors last night, and was further delighted to have an enforcement officer check my blue badge this morning, just after moving someone on!\"\n\"Councillors should look to make a tangible difference during their tenure, and I hope this makes a difference for fellow disabled residents of Brentwood.\"\nThe full text of the motion is below:\nBlue Badge parking spaces are an invaluable lifeline for people with disabilities to enable them to access goods, services, and help them to lead an independent life, as they should be entitled to.\nHowever, inconsiderate motorists frequently block blue badge parking spaces.\nIt is unacceptable, and can not be allowed to continue. It is unfair on our mobility challenged residents, and therefore, we need to support parking enforcement officers to deal with it.\nBrentwood Borough Council will itself adopt a more rigorous approach and call upon SEPP and private parking operators (such as NCP, Horizon, and Parking Ticket Ltd.) to operate a zero-tolerance approach to non-blue badge holders, parking in blue badge spaces in our borough, and to impose and enforce the traffic regulations.\nRead More via Essex Live 'Brentwood Council adopts zero-tolerance approach to motorists abusing blue badge parking spaces'.",

Whether the argument is that it is \"pending an investigation\" is irrelevant, the point is that a public record has been censored.\n\"In my career I've often noticed that the actual behaviour of people in an organisation is strongly influenced by what their leaders do. So, what is the likely effect on the officers of her action? Will they now feel that they can also be less than completely open and transparent because their MD has shown the way? Did she consider the precedent she was setting by her actions?\n\"At the start of every meeting we are reminded by the chair that the events of the meeting will be recorded and that our human rights may be infringed. I've always thought that meant that if we said or did something that we might later regret, that meant that we would be unable to change the record. The managing director's action now tells us that there are events that can result in the record being censored, so mistakes can be hidden from the public.\n\"Where are the rules covering censorship of the webcasts? Has a precedent now been set that says that the MD can withdraw any webcast in future? Where are the limits of her powers in this area? Could the Leader direct the MD to take down a webcast, or censor specific sections of it?\n\"The fact that this action can be taken, and has now been taken, means that we must find out the powers that the MD and Leader have in this area and demand a debate on the subject at the next council meeting. My question is - what powers to censor council meetings do the MD and Leader have and what powers should they have in an open and transparent organisation?\"",

The move came when the administration decided to make political staff to the Liberal Democrat and Conservative group redundant.\nSpeaking about the decision, Lib Dem group leader Cllr Tom Smith-Hughes said:\n\"Only recently, Lord Hanningfield was complaining to the national press that a \"vindictive campaign\" had been launched against him by a Liberal Democrat MP. This was in response to the news that Scotland Yard had decided to investigate Lord Hanningfield's House of Lords expenses. It can hardly be a coincidence that a short time later the Lib Dem group has been thrown off the council's Waste Advisory Board and is now having its only full time staff member made redundant.\n\"Given the already outrageous number of full time employees dedicated to working for the Administration group, it is clear that this Tory group's main preoccupation is with occupying power and then cutting down the opportunities for anyone to question them.

If a Conservative candidate or campaigner knocks on your door perhaps question them on this matter.\n2 - You've had over a decade in power what is suddenly going to change to enable you to tackle:\nFly Tipping. The Conservatives manifesto has some promises on this. This is a serious issue. My feelings just from travelling around is that the issue seems to be growing and has been growing for sometime. What is going to change on May 6th that means the Conservatives should get another go at this?\nCar Parking: The Conservatives state: \"Deliver a parking strategy that increases capacity and maintains affordability,\" and \"Resolve the pavement parking issue in Brentwood High Street.\" Ok fair enough. If you have just moved into the Borough and had no idea who had been in control for the last decade plus you'd think great. But set in the context of Conservatives in power at local, county and national level for the majority of this century you do begin to wonder why the May local elections will mark such a change and lead to some proactivity in this area.\nThe manifesto sets out a policy of Brown Field sites first for future housing. You'll find no disagreement from the Lib Dems on that. But why bring this forward now after so much green belt has been developed already?\n3 - What do you actually mean?\nThe manifesto states. \"Ensure Community Safety as lockdown restrictions ease working in partnership with Essex Police.\" Sorry that's just words not an actual policy. Can someone find out if the police have been informed?\nI have a similar response to: \"Form an Environmental Business Alliance, that enables businesses to play a proactive role in carbon offsetting and local environmental initiatives\".\n4 - Can we actually trust you on this one?\n\"Never compromise Brentwood's sovereignty by merging with another council.\" Putting aside the rather Brexit chagrin use of the word 'sovereignty' Brentwood Borough Council is an active member of the Association of South Essex Local Authorities (ASELA) and has been working in conjunction with a number of South Essex local authorities. This in and of itself is clearly not a problem but after the election, there does need to be a full clarification on the role of ASELA and its role going into the future. Noting that there are local elections happening throughout Essex the make and role of ASELA might naturally change but if it continues to exist, as a public body it needs to be explicit in its role and future intentions.\n5 - As Lib Dems we like bits\nSome parts are good. We like some of the environmental statements, active travel, helping people with their physical and mental health is sound and very necessary. Unfortunately (for Conservatives), these are key components of our manifesto. It is for you to decide who gets the chance to take their manifesto forward after the elections. I hope that you consider your local Lib Dem candidate, they will work for you and representing your interests.\nREAD THE LIB DEM MANIFESTO HERE.\nGary MacDonnell is Chair of Brentwood Liberal Democrats and our candidate for the 2021 Borough Council election for Shenfield Ward.

The meeting was packed with local residents and those who also use the area to ride, cycle, drive and walk.\nThe meeting commenced with those present spending a moment in quiet reflection over the recent loss of life.\nThe aim of the meeting was not to apportion blame but to look forward as to what measures are needed to help prevent such a dreadful accident occurring again and generally make the area safer. Residents put forward a wide variety of ideas and suggestions, all of which had great merit. These ranged from the introduction of speed checks on a regular basis, reinstatement of highway verges, width restrictions, making all bridleways fully accessible and the introduction of new areas for horse riding so the busier roads can be avoided.\nThe local school has presented long term parking problems for the staff, parents and local residents and if alternative parking areas can be identified and work funded then the need for off street parking is critical.\nCllr Vicky Davies said:\n\"All the information from the meeting will be collated and raised with County Council highway officers responsible for Brentwood's roads.

The Council could, and should, have employed a dedicated full time officer from the start rather than spending the equivalent of a 5.5% increase in council tax on the two temporary appointments.\nThe council have just received a £829,000 VAT refund which is the equivalent of the council of being given a \"get out of jail free card\". Without that windfall the reserves would be in a very sorry state and we would have had a very different budget indeed.\nMr McKenzie uses the term \"High Risk\" a number of times in the report and for us that term sums up the whole budget. A lot of it is high risk.\nWe are being asked to endorse a Capital Programme which is supported by £0.5m of borrowing rather than using capital receipts. However, when you look at the detail it is very woolly on a number of fronts. Certain projects have been given a Priority 2 rating which basically means there is no timescale attached to them.

Worryingly, one in four people will become mentally unwell at some point in their lives with increasing numbers of young people affected.\nLatest research by the Kings Fund shows a failing system that is under pressure and in crisis. Ongoing funding cuts are leading to widespread evidence of poor quality care with only 14% of patients saying that they have received appropriate treatment. In recent years, due to budget cuts, there has been a poor level of support in community mental health care. Successive government ministers, with the notable exception of Lib Dem MP and mental health champion Norman Lamb as junior health minister from 2010-2015, have merely paid lip service to the needs of mental ill health.\nThe system has become over reliant on self-funding charities that provide a safety net for those falling outside of the system where they can.\n'Brentwood Community Print CIC', is an example of good practice supporting those recovering from mental ill health back into work but they cope on a shoestring budget. They link with other voluntary organisations to form a 'community tree' of organisations - again, mostly voluntary, that offer help and support. Sport England's research shows exercise can be a \"wonder drug\" increasing mental wellbeing and the Brentwood Centre's 'Fitness in Mind' has contributed greatly in this area.\nHowever, we only have to visit Brentwood High Street to see how the care system is failing with drunken and distressed rough sleepers that slip through the net of care and treatment.",

These represent a serious safety issue. There needs to be a major pothole repair programme instigated as soon as possible across the borough to make our roads safer for motorists and pedestrians before any introduction of part night time lighting.\n- We have a number of footpaths in Brentwood that are in need of urgent repair.

White Papers are when Governments produce proposals before new laws. A new law to put these changes into effect is expected later in 2025.\nThe White Paper contains two different sets of proposals, which the Liberal Democrats say should be treated separately but are being squashed together and rushed through. The proposals cover:\n- Devolution (which should be about the transfer of powers and money from the Westminster Government to local areas) and\n- Local Government Reorganisation, which means getting rid of Essex County Council and local Councils like Chelmsford, Colchester, Brentwood and Rochford, could make local councils more remote.\nLiberal Democrats say devolution should be genuine (with real power and money transferred from Westminster), and reorganisation should be done only after proper consultation on what is best for residents. The Liberal Democrats proposed an amendment to delay the rush to change so that the impact on vital services could be considered.\nCounty Councillor Stephen Robinson (LD – Chelmsford North) said: “There is a real danger that both of these changes are just reorganising the deck chairs on the Titanic.\n“The ‘Local Government ship’ has already hit not one but three icebergs – massively rising costs of adult social care, children’s services and homelessness. Where is the government's support for stopping the ‘Local Government ship’ from sinking? The recent budget did not make things better and probably made the future worse for all councils.\n“Liberal Democrats support genuine devolution if it brings real power closer to residents, ensuring that decisions for our communities are made by local people. Genuine local control over funding must follow the devolution of powers so that councils can properly fund community services and vital infrastructure.\n“This model of devolution – supported by Conservatives and Labour – means places that want new powers have to have an elected Mayor. Liberal Democrats oppose putting so much power in the hands of one person. There is no real accountability during their four years, however bad or dangerous they become.\n“It is a real shame that the Labour Government is little different from the Conservative one – neither care what residents want, want to force change through, and want to avoid an election for as long as possible.\n“However, the Government is determined to press ahead, so we need to be realistic. Our amendment does not oppose the plans; it merely proposes that we take the proper time to consider what is right for Essex and that this Council does so by working with all 14 of the other councils in Essex, not just Southend and Thurrock – who, incidentally, are both smaller in population than Basildon, Colchester and Chelmsford. I so move.”\nLib Dem Leader Cllr. Mike Mackrory added, “We propose a pause until the second phase to enable viable alternative structures to be put in place and give officers enough time and space to ensure that our most vulnerable residents in the care of Children’s Services and Adult Social Care will be appropriately considered.\n“We also believe that the residents of Essex must be given the chance to be consulted – not ignored - and to vote on 1st May this year. Delaying elections - and extending the life of this Council by three years - denies that democratic right. It is a democratic outrage. If this is such a fantastic idea, why are the Conservatives scared of an election? Is it because they know they will lose their majority?”\nBrentwood Councillors speak out\nCllr Barry Aspinell (LD – Pilgrims Hatch) said, “We believe in the importance of LOCAL government, being accessible to residents and community identity. Large unitary councils will not deliver that.\nThere is NO hard evidence that reorganisation will save money. The suggested savings were in a report commissioned by county councils, who, as upper-tier authorities, are biased, and the savings they suggest are LESS than the amount of money that councils have been taking out of their budgets every year for the last five years or more.\n“There is also plenty of evidence that it will COST a LOT of money in the short-term, as new staff are appointed and reorganised, plus prolonged disruption to local services during transition and beyond.\n“When people say there will be fewer politicians, that is the opposite of the truth. District councillors primarily consist of local people who are NOT full-time politicians. They serve as part of broader service to the local community and have other jobs.\n“The danger of these large, new councils is that they WILL lead to more full-time politicians because the areas they represent and the workload is so high that only someone who does it full-time can cope. That is the complete opposite of representative.”\nCouncillor Aspinell added: “Brentwood Borough Council is a member of the District Councils Network, which has been pointing out the flaws in these arrangements since they were announced following the election of the Labour government.\n“Requests for devolution and subsequent discussions on reform were limited to upper-tier authorities like Essex County Council; District Councils were not directly invited to participate. We should take the proper time to consider what is right for Brentwood.”\nHe added: “Labour’s plans barely mention residents, with just a short section on community empowerment. It argues for councils to serve a fixed population of 500,000 or more, something confirmed by Angela Rayner yesterday. The government says only councils of that size can coordinate the work needed to deliver the growth and efficiencies that Labour seeks. It is a technocrat’s dream.”\n“Some existing unitary authorities are thriving, with much smaller populations. The focus should be on creating cohesive and sustainable authorities that truly reflect the communities they serve, rather than adhering to arbitrary numbers that could undermine this goal.”\n“I favour genuine devolution, moving powers and money from Westminster and Chelmsford to local areas. I have consistently sought devolution of powers from the County Council to fix our roads and sort out the disgraceful state of the High Streets in Brentwood and Shenfield. I have been brushed off by the Tories at Essex County Council each time.\nLocal government is about giving people real influence over the places they live and care about. It matters to them, and it matters to us. Reorganisation means eliminating local Councils like Brentwood and our partners in Rochford. It will make local councils bigger and more impersonal, more remote, less democratic, and less visible. It will also place additional strain and workload on our Brentwood and County Council staff.\n“Essex’s proposals will also postpone elections for up to three years, including one in Brentwood South, which has been unrepresented for many months because of incapacity. The Tories propose leaving Brentwood South residents without a voice until 2028 when their views should matter most.”\n“Being realistic, the Government is determined to make these reforms happen. As Leader of Brentwood Borough Council, I will argue for the best possible outcome for Brentwood’s residents, building on the strength of our Joint Administration. I will discuss the results of Friday’s vote with my fellow Liberal Democrat Councillors and decide how best to respond as a Council.”\nCouncillor David Kendall (LD – Brentwood West) said: 'I'm disappointed to hear that, thanks to a stitch-up by both the Labour and Tory parties, Essex residents have been denied a vote for three years.”\n“The Liberal Democrats supported the elections going ahead in May, allowing residents to exercise their democratic right to choose who represents them and to express their opinions. Anything else smacks of their being scared to face the people and proves that both parties will do anything to hang onto power in Essex.”\nOther Councillors also criticised the moves.\nCllr Mark Cory (Wivenhoe St Andrews) added: “The plans to reorganise local government are being forced through at pace. Unitary Councils make sense in principle to Lib Dems, removing the confusing two-tier system. However, large, unwieldy, less-local democracy is not good for residents. The Conservatives' plans endanger local democracy, postpone elections for years, and extend the life of Essex CC for an extraordinary THREE years.\n“It is also essential that the issue of debts taken on by near-bankrupt Thurrock are resolved without impacting on the rest of Essex.”\nCllr James Newport (Rayleigh North) said: “We should not force new councils to conform to a fixed population of 500,000 or more. Many existing unitary authorities are thriving, with populations in the 250,000 to 300,000 range. They are effective, efficient, and - most importantly - locally accountable. Insisting on such a large number risks creating administrative monstrosities that lump together areas with little in common, erasing the unique sense of place and identity that our communities cherish.\n“Local government must remain truly local. If we ignore this, we risk creating systems of governance that feel distant and detached—unable to respond effectively to the distinct needs of our residents. The focus should be on creating cohesive, sustainable, and reflective authorities of the communities they serve—not adhering to arbitrary numbers that threaten to undermine that.”",

This would be unacceptable for any councillor with principles, who would rightly feel that representing their residents (not kow-towing to their leadership's every wish), was what they were there for - and yet we've often seen it. Unacceptable though this is, however, it was surpassed on Wednesday when combined with a blatant preparedness to ignore basic standards of behavour expected of responsible adults, let alone those in public life.\nWhat happened?\nFirstly, Cllr. Hirst, as deputy leader, tabled a motion that breached the most fundamental element of the Members Code of Conduct: \"you must treat others with respect\", since it constituted an open personal attack on Cllr. Chilvers, as Chair of the panel intended to scrutinise the council's affairs.\nSecondly, more than one other Conservative councillor, when speaking in favour of this move, again breached the same code, and for exactly the same reasons.\nThirdly, when they had done so (and there could have been no question that they had), they were picked up on it neither by officers, nor by their own leadership. Being Cllr. Hirst's own motion, he might hardly be critical, but Cllr. McKinlay (recently returned from maternity leave and maybe entirely out of the loop whilst it was decided to take this action), could have stepped in with perfect ease. She could have immediately cautioned her members that, whilst the motion was directed at an individual, hostile personal remarks constituted behaviour which was unacceptable to her, specifically forbidden by Brentwood's Code of Conduct, and intolerable in Brentwood Conservatives. She could have asked for a simple retraction of unconsidered remarks made in the heat of the moment, and we need have heard no more of it. But none of this happened - all was apparently acceptable. Fourthly, at the vote, every single Tory present voted for the motion, without any abstentions.\nThis is a decision taken by each of these members individually which they must have weighed up beforehand. I'll admit (although this might surprise some who heard what I said on the night) that my own assumption prior to the meeting was that Cllr. Hirst's motion would certainly run up against some members on the Conservative side whose consciences would make them far too principled to vote in favour of it; individuals who I have felt respect for in the past and who (as I thought) could not possibly stoop so low. I am devastated to discover that I've obviously overestimated them all, since not even one was seemingly prepared to abide by the basic standards of behaviour that I had (clearly naively) imagined would defeat the motion.\nIf you, personally, have ever voted for one of them in the past then I'd urge you to contact them immediately and demand to know what in God's name they thought they were doing that night, and, unless you get some very convincing reason back (though what possible \"reason\" there might be for such unforgivable conduct I can't imagine), to refuse, on the spot, to vote for such conduct in the chamber, ever again (as it happens, both of the worst offenders, uncriticised on the night, are standing for re-election next year).\nOne of the least happy places in Britain? With such standards of behaviour apparently acceptable, Brentwood under the Tories has rotted to the core.",

Unlike at Westminster, where key issues are being ignored due to them spending so much time and money discussing Brexit.\nHigh on the list of local issues are problems with roads and pavements, consistently generating the most complaints. Essex Highways has decided to concentrate on main road repairs, so the side roads that we all use day to day have been neglected, as have pavements. The Liberal Democrats have proposed more cash for pavement repairs at the last few budget meetings but have been turned down by the Conservative majority.\nWith thousands more houses being built, we often hear residents saying (justifiably) that Conservative council bosses are too often letting developers get away with not providing the infrastructure that is essential to ensuring we build strong communities. Similarly, they are not building enough affordable housing, so young people in particular are priced out of their own communities.\nThe housing crisis also means that around 1000 families in mid/west Essex are homeless, often because a tenant loses their job and cannot afford rent. They are put into unsatisfactory, temporary housing by the council. Some more end up sleeping rough on our streets.\nCouncillors will also be supporting residents worried about Essex County Council plans to close 25 libraries and threaten 19 more.

They reacted angrily to the news when it was announced as an urgent item of business at Wednesday's Policy Panel meeting (18/6/08).\nUp until now Brentwood Borough Council has always operated a Committee/Panel structure of meetings to conduct the council's business and this has enabled members from all the political parties to play an active role in the decision making process. However the move to a cabinet system of local government will mean that many major council decisions will now be made by an individual cabinet member leaving the majority of councillors excluded from the process.\nThe cabinet system operates already in nearby Chelmsford but it is known that members from all the political parties are unhappy with the way it operates. The Conservatives in Brentwood will be legally forced to undertake a public consultation exercise on their cabinet proposals but they will definitely face a tough fight from the Liberal Democrats who have said they will be urging residents to stay with the existing Committee/Panel system.\nLiberal Democrat Leader Cllr David Kendall said\n\"We do not believe the move to a cabinet system in Brentwood will enhance the democratic process and have serious concerns that it will close down debate on many of the key issues facing the Borough. The current Committee/Panel system has served our community very well up until now and we see no reason to change it.\n\"We don't believe it is a sensible idea to put even more power into the hands of a small clique of councillors and we will be actively campaigning against the Conservatives cabinet proposal.\"",

Cllr Davies said, on the night:\n\"I cannot support the rent setting and business plan tonight because I believe your business plan is flawed and tenants are becoming the soft targets and being victimised.\"\nCllr Davies objections were based on the following factors:\n- The Government \"re-invigoration\" of the Right to Buy will further reduce our already depleted housing stock. The projected sales will leave Brentwood Borough Council with only £510.000 to reinvest in some housing re-provision - not like for like - and yet still requiring borrowing of a further £2 million with debt repayment implications. .\n- The stringent Welfare Reform changes are to have a draconian effect on many households and that is indicated by the need to increase the council's debt provision levels by 120%\n- This linked with rent rises ,way above inflation, will push many families onto housing benefit for the first time and where the housing benefit falls short of the rent rises others will be pushed into poverty.\n- The hardship fund is supposedly there to assist in cases of deprivation but offering loans to those in financial distress will only increase their debt levels compounding already intolerable situations.\nThe £74,000 deficit in year one could be sustained if borrowing levels are reduced for housing reprovision by use of interest accrued or monies from the New Homes Grant of £462,000 received by this council in 2012 and currently sitting in the general fund.\nFurther saving could be found by lessening the increase in the Talkback grant from the proposed £15 to £50 this year.\nCllr Davies concluded:\n\"The matter of most concern is whether the Brentwood housing stock is safe in Tory hands when in their report it says \"During 2013/14 we will carry out an evaluation of future options for the management of our stock in order to decide on the best outcomes on the future delivery of housing services for Brentwood residents\" and despite asking this at the meeting, I am still awaiting a response to that question.\"\nJust another example of the Conservatives putting headlines ahead of the needs of residents.",

Fly-tippers are serious criminals. If they dump dangerous rubbish on a road, byway, bridleway or footpath they endanger drivers, riders, cyclists and walkers. If they dump it on private land the landowner suffers the expense and inconvenience of clearing it. These criminals don't care about the damage they're causing to our local environment.\nUnfortunately, a contributing factor is likely to be Conservative-run Essex County Council cutting the service at the waste centres. Some have had restrictions placed on what residents can take to their local centre and other centres have been closed, meaning longer journeys to the nearest one. Some people may not bother and just dump their rubbish on the road side.\nFly-tipping is on the rise. In 2016/17 there were 1,002,000 incidents in England - up 41% over five years.\nIf cases come to court then yes, penalties are high enough. If convicted, a fly-tipper faces a maximum fine of £50,000 or 12 months in prison. Offenders may have to pay legal costs and compensation. Their assets can be frozen, and vehicles confiscated. However, more commonly, local authorities issue fixed penalty notices between £150 - £400 for small-scale fly-tipping. It's clear that small-time fly-tippers only face small fines which don't act as a deterrent. These need to be dramatically increased to deter offenders.\nResidents can take a few steps to help too.\nIf you have someone working on your property you can check that the waste material is disposed of in a safe and legal manner by checking the waste carrier's registration on the Environment Agency's website. It can also be reported to your local council or reported to the police on 101 if you witness it, with the vehicle details as this can be vital evidence in a prosecution.\n(Article written for Essex Chronicle by Hugh Gorton, Brentwood)",

In response, newly-elected Cllr Mark Lewis has the following comments:\n\"Many people will like Lidl but, of course, those most affected are the ones that live nearest to it in Brentwood North and in the wider town centre. It has the possibility to draw in a significant amount of traffic/people from outside the immediate area and the adverse implications are significant. In its current format, I do not find the proposal acceptable for a number of reasons:\n- The environmental pollution paper is not believable. Most of the analysis is not relevant to the immediate impacted area. We need some professional support to help validate my suspicions. The traffic jams that will be created are not properly assessed from an environmental perspective...this will not be a free-flowing road and cars pollute at a peak when in traffic jams.\n- Traffic analysis is extensive but knowing the road and the likely popularity of Lidl, I do not believe the conclusions.\n- The analysis does not include the impact on Burland Road and the related school traffic/houses in the area.\n- On noise, the conclusion cannot be correct...it only makes sense if the traffic jams are so insignificant that no traffic is moving...in which case, the traffic and environmental papers cannot be correct.\n- The shop building and area is significant in height and scope. This will have an impact on local residents.\n- Proposal is for 80 flats but only 59 with 61 car spaces are shown - how does this fit in? Most of these 59 are one bedroom flats. I am not sure this is desirable - what living accommodation and social environment are we trying too create in Brentwood? Where is the family housing and social housing element? What is the impact on social infrastructure such as doctors, dentists, schools, etc. The residential units seem rather unpleasant - e.g. they do not seem very quiet next to a supermarket.\n- Is there really scope for the underground car park?\n- The resident consultation ending at June 14 is an attempt to jam the local residents...what is going on here. With such a major development, 2.5 weeks is woefully insufficient, in fact an outrage.\n- I do not see what Lidl is giving to Brentwood in exchange for approval, even if limited approval on a smaller footprint.\n- there are no mitigations of any of the issues above proposed apart from the cross-road at North Road...the only external work I can see is the traffic lights and turning into Lidl by car...but this will make the road a nightmare.\n- The building work period has been significantly underplayed. Lorries, etc will clog up the road for years not to mention noise and dirt in the process. I see no mitigations of this and i do not believe the \"dirt\" analysis.\nI would urge residents to view the planning application HERE and make their representations to the council and their local councillors.The Brentwood Gazette also has an excellent summary here.",

This is the response from Lib Dem Leader Cllr David Kendall.\n\"I am sure the comments made by the leader Cllr Louise McKinlay and the anonymous Council spokesman in last weeks Gazette regarding the William Hunter Way development will have left many residents feeling totally baffled and confused on the whole issue.\n\"Cllr McKinlay is quoted as saying \" We are legally committed to the current deal until 2013 and we expect progress before then\" and a Council spokesman is quoted as saying \"The final proposal will only be signed and finalised if it works for Brentwood. If it is not in Brentwood's interests to sign we won't\". Those comments make things as clear as mud and highlight why it was so necessary for Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors to call for an extraordinary meeting so that the matter could be properly discussed and debated in public.\n\"The Liberal Democrat position on the William Hunter Way development has always been very clear and consistent. We have always been strong supporters of a Cinema coming back to Brentwood but we voted against the William Hunter Way application back in 2007 because we felt the sheer size, scale and mass of what was being proposed was wrong for the town. Five years later our position hasn't changed we still have many serious reservations about the Stockland scheme and do not feel it is the right one for Brentwood.\n\"Over the last five years trying to get information out of the Tory administration running Brentwood on the William Hunter Way development has been like trying to get blood out of a stone. Only now by the opposition calling for an Extraordinary meeting on the issue have questions started to be answered and some of the facts revealed.

We believe she was wrong to appoint her colleague Cllr Keith Parker to oversee the project at such a late stage in the negotiations.

We also believe she has failed to deliver the openness and transparency on the issue that residents and councillors should rightly expect and deserve.\n\"When William Hunter Way is discussed I hope all councillors will put any party allegiances to one side, ignore any three line whips and vote for what they believe is right for Brentwood.

Then on Sundays residents will be charged 40p per hour during those hours.\nThe Lib Dems oppose the charges and after the meeting, leader Cllr David Kendall said: \"This is the wrong time to be introducing these charges when so many residents and businesses are really suffering.\n\"Free parking at the Town Hall attracted shoppers to the town and gave a boost to the local economy.\nTo start charging now will be another kick in the teeth to many local retailers and businesses.\"\nAt the meeting the chairman, Cllr Louise McKinlay said these charges had been factored into the budget, which had enabled them to offer such a low council tax rise.\nShe also explained that the spaces were usually taken by workers rather than the shoppers they were trying to attract. She said: \"Anyone who actually visits the council's car park on a Saturday morning around 8.30am will see it's full already.\"\nThe panel also voted in favour of providing overnight parking at the Coptfold Road multi-storey car park at a charge of £520 a year, a cost to be reviewed in September and is to reflect the fact it is well-lit and secure.

At Westbury Road car park residents will be able to park in the evenings and at weekends for £360 a year, it was decided.\nAnd residents will be able to use visitors permits in the car park on an ad hoc basis.\nThe Lib Dems were again opposed to these \"money-making\" car parking charges.

This strikes me now as a very negative way of looking at voting. My revised answer is that by voting in the election you can support a candidate who will represent your views and can influence the policy issues you care about. An election is also your chance to speak out if you have a complaint about the way the Parish/Borough/District/Country is being run. Voting is not the only way to participate but it's the quickest and easiest way. If you don't vote, you'll have had no say over who will be making decisions on the issues important to you.\nI'm afraid that politics is everywhere. It's not something that can be stopped or paused. I am actively involved in politics, I enjoy politics I always have, but even I think from time to time could we just have a pause. But our society doesn't work that way. Politics dictates everything. If you are functioning in our society you are I'm afraid involved in politics. You can't avoid it. Political debates exist around everything we do. Poor a bowl of breakfast cereal and politicians have been involved in the food labelling and food standards of that meal. Switch on the TV, hope you've got a TV licence even if you're not tuning into the BBC - politics. Bit of social media catch up? Where do you stand on Facebook/Twitter and their inaction over recent racist/sexist abuse on their platforms to black and female athletes? You might declare yourself the most unpolitical person on the planet but I'm afraid you can't escape it. Politics has literally dictated what you can and can't do over the past year.\nStrap yourself in for a statement of the obvious. In a democracy, if you do not agree with the people who are in charge then you can vote in an election to try and change that. If you do agree with the people in charge, then you can vote in an election to make sure that they become politicians again. Politicians have to listen to the vote for them because, if they don't, people will vote for somebody else next time. Let me give you a painful example. The Lib Dems went into the 2019 General Election with a position on Europe that was deeply unpopular (reminder it was a position to ignore the result\nof the referendum and revoke article 50). This position was utterly rejected by the electorate. Try and find a Lib Dem candidate standing for an election in May that would take the party's position from the election in December 2019 - you'd struggle. Politics is the ultimate you say we did. Politicians listen and the more people that vote the louder that voice and the more politicians will listen.\nAll candidates standing for the Liberal Democrats in Brentwood in the May elections this year have listened. We believe we can improve Brentwood as a place to live. Please see our manifesto here.\nWe believe that we can make Brentwood a safer, greener and fairer place to live. We believe we can provide better support to those that need it. Unlike the Conservatives we will fight for the independence of Brentwood and not link up with a combined South Essex authority.\nSo please vote and consider the Liberal Democrats as the place to loan your vote to.

High streets that survive offer entertainment, café society and green spaces to enjoy alongside retail. It's not enough to stick shops in a row and cross fingers - a suitable infrastructure must support access, encourage footfall flow and provide ambience.\nA fundamental issue for many towns is that they were originally created in a bygone era - Brentwood a prime example as a medieval town that has had bits added over 800+ years. Often intrinsic to charm and ambience and with care, can fuse to provide a must-visit place although, to survive, a perspective with an overarching vision for a town or city is needed to celebrate the old within the modern world and to futureproof it. A bold step was taken by the private sector in Chelmsford to create 'Bond Street' and a \"destination\" was born with distinct, high-class branding that tells people that this is \"the place to be\". The public sector needs to follow suit.\nCar, cycle, pedestrian and mobility access must all be simple so to funnel customers in. Lakeside was a revolution when it opened in 1990 and it was ground-breaking in its customer-centric design that paved the way from car, coach, bus and, later, train, in to its malls. 29 years later, maybe it's taken for granted but for those that remember it opening, it was utopian at the time and more lessons should have been learned.\nFinancially, and in a quicker win for struggling businesses that suffer from high business rates imposed, the Liberal Democrats have a policy to abolish the broken business rates system and replace it with a Commercial Landowner Levy in a plan where 93% of businesses would pay less, and it's being championed right now by our leader Sir Vince Cable MP.\n(Article written for Essex Chronicle by Cllr Karen Chilvers, Brentwood)",

We have continued to oppose tuition fees, to support Votes at 16 and to fight for an equal minimum wage for all, despite opposition from Labour and the Conservatives.\n\"Liberal Youth and the Liberal Democrats represent the fundamental, radical change that this country and our political system needs. We are the only party that has the courage and the passion to achieve our aims, and the only party with a plan for how to create a better future for all young people in this country, not just the select few.\n\"If you believe that there needs to be substantial change, please join us in our fight for this.\"\nCllr David Kendall, Brentwood & Ongar's Parliamentary Spokesman, said:\n\"Unlike many other parties we are seeing our party grow locally, including many younger members. For instance, our Cllr Ross Carter was elected at just 24 and has made a real impact on his residents who admire his enthusiasm and energy. They also recognise the hard work he puts into campaigning for them, as demonstrated by the William Hunter Way campaign. I would be delighted to see more young people involved.\"\n\"I wish Liberal Youth every success with their new website and am sure that, through this and other social media platforms, they will have tremendous success in building the future of our party.\"",

Many of those decisions can have broad ramifications and since accurate assessment of risk is challenging for the vast majority of people we need a framework to support our decision making. We rely on experts gathering, analysing and presenting the conclusions from vast amounts of data to provide guidance on topics ranging from education to nutrition. But, how do we decide who is an expert and how do we react to the variety of ways guidance is proposed or imposed? For example, why does the law in the UK mandate your child must wear a seatbelt but only recommends they must be vaccinated?\nThe World Health Organisation recommends at least 95% of people be vaccinated in order to provide herd immunity for those who are medically unable to receive the vaccination or for whom it is ineffective. The challenge most countries face is reaching the magic 95% level when parents are understandably concerned about potential side effects of vaccinations at an individual level whilst also finding it hard to picture the real consequences of not vaccinating - having (luckily) never really seen what a case of measles or diphtheria looks like.\nMany countries impose vaccinations, primarily by restricting access to education for unvaccinated children. This is not the case in the UK where reticence to vaccinate in some groups has led to outbreaks of preventable diseases over recent years. So,the question now for UK public health policy is whether it should be led by the carrot or the stick. Undoubtedly education of those reluctant to vaccinate should be the gold standard but if this continues to not be fully effective then it could be time for a stronger approach.",

Was it worth it?\nOver £5m of our money has been spent on agency and interim staff to replace those experienced, local knowledge based personnel that were made redundant, supposedly to save money.\nStaff morale at the Town Hall is now at an all time low, and it shows.\nOur accounts have, in the recent past, been a shambles and ridiculed the reputation of our council.\nThe auditors refused to sign them off, even though we had paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for two agency finance officers who completely cocked them up.\nThe attest financial farce, it seems, is the writing off of one complete set of figures relating to our valuation of council assets because nobody has bothered to get them updated for more than a decade.\nIt also appears we have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds of Section 106 monies from developers.\nAnd now, the \"savings\" made by staff redundancies are being used to subsidise our daytime parking charges.\nThe Tories refused to consider the proposal by the Lib Dems of a night-time tariff which was aimed at gaining revenue from our TOWIE visitors and which would subsidise our day time parking charges.\nSo disastrous and obnoxious have the Tories been, that for the first time in my 32-year political tenure the entire opposition is united against them. The final straw was when they changed the rules and ousted the opposition chair of Overview & Scrutiny for daring to scrutinise them and hold them to their account - putting a Tory in to oversee the Tory administration!\nWithin the opposition councillors there is the talent, the initiative, the determination and a large chunk of professionalism to take over the reins and put Brentwood back where it should be, at the top of the best run council league table.\nThis would include building affordable homes for our local people, sorting out the effects of Crossrail, delivering the Local Development Plan, improving our recreational facilities, keeping Brentwood green and clean and reinvigorating out front line services by spending money on those areas you residents believe are key.",

We all followed suit in pursuit of cheaper and cheaper produce.

With the area short of parking and this adding nothing to the ambience it could solve a parking issue and assist and support local residents and businesses in Kings Road if the council were to convert it into resident or shopper parking - which would bring in much needed revenue to the council. She asked officers to enquire how much the land would cost in order to understand the issue and put forward a proposal, if appropriate.\nShe waited 237 for an answer (10 is all a councillor should really have to wait) only to get an answer from officers that \"we thought about it but there is no budget so we decided not to do anything further\".\nCllr Chilvers said:\n\"I asked for some figures on which to build an analysis to improve a situation in Brentwood West and I have had to wait 8 months to find they didn't do anything.\n\"This is astounding, undemocratic and just plain wrong - it is not up to officers to \"decide\" not to proceed with something. It is my job, as ward councillor to try and improve my ward. but I cannot move things forward unless I get the information from officers.\n\"What should have happened is that the question should have been asked of Amstrad, it should have come back to me with financial information. Then, I could have weighed up the pros and cons and whether this was of benefit to residents (by consultation) and viable for Brentwood Council. At this point, I could have built a business case for the Asset Panel, discussed it with the chair and proceeded (or not) via the democratic process.\n\"The fact that there was no budget for this was an irrelevance, because money can always be found if there is a good business case and there are benefits.\n\"I have now asked again for a financial analysis and an approach to Amstrad but the worrying things are that this shows up the total lack of strategy by the Tories running Brentwood with NO budget for land purchase, the lack of due process being followed by not reverting to ward councillors, the fact that officers have made a decision without any of the full facts being considered and the lack of investment in an area of heavy inhabitance and our shopping districts.\"",

The Tories' top priority is to cut taxes on millionaires. Our top priority is fairer taxes for those on lower and middle incomes. It would be dishonest and unbelievable for any political party to say that taxes should never rise. But the Liberal Democrats starting point is to aim for fairer not higher taxes. We believe it is wrong that people on the minimum wage should be dragged into paying tax. Lifting the tax threshold to £10,000 would mean that 4 million low paid workers and pensioners would no longer have to pay any income tax.\n\"Our priority would be to cut income tax for those on low and middle incomes. Any such tax could be paid for by closing tax loopholes and privileges enjoyed by the relatively wealthy: the big differential between top rate income tax and capital gains tax, the exceptionally generous tax relief on large pension pots, and the blatant abuse of tax haven status including businesses paying stamp duty offshore.\n\"We would also propose a 0.5% tax for properties over £1m to tackle council tax anomaly. Current Council tax bands mean a property worth £750,000 is taxed the same as one worth £10 million. We propose to introduce a supplement to Council tax to tackle this distortion. The supplement would be 0.5% of a residential properties value above a threshold of £1 million per property. This would effect around 1% of the most valuable properties in the UK but would lift 300,000 low paid workers and pensioners out of paying tax altogether.\n\"We also want to shift the tax burden further from income - work, savings and innovation onto pollution - the green tax switch. Switching taxation onto financial pollution - questionable transactions of no social and economic value and on to land values instead of penalising productive investment.\"",

It works on the principle of having specific committees making decisions on relevant issues and those elected councillors on the committee (usually 11 or 12 in total) voting on the matters. This means that the councillors who are voting will have (or at least should have) or will gain (or at least should gain) an in-depth understanding of their subject.\nNow, all those committees that have overseen council business and allowed focused councillors to vote on it (comprising Health, Housing, Environment, Assets, Retail, Community, Leisure, Localism, Parking, Communications, Refuse, Highways etc) have all been rolled in to one huge committee to push through the Tories' agenda.\nLib Dems feel that this will be unmanageable and will have to be split in to two panels or some business will go to a sub-panel, wiping out any saving.

You can read his email here:\n\"Dear Norman\n\"At the last Brentwood Highways Panel meeting on November 9th I expressed my concerns once again regarding the County's policy on Salt bins and the proposed new Salt bags. These last few days in Brentwood have seen my worst fears confirmed as many residents particularly the elderly have been marooned in Brentwood side roads that have any sort of hill or a slight incline. There appear to be very few salt bins left in Brentwood town centre and to the best of my knowledge we haven't had any salt bags delivered at all. Brentwood town centre has no Town Council and we have very few Residents Associations. Consequently residents in the side roads have been left to totally fend for themselves.\n\"In my own road, which is a hill, many people including me have been unable to go to work for two days. I phoned up the West Area Office again today and asked for a Salt bag to be delivered to my drive and said I would organise residents to make sure it was distributed properly. The lady I spoke to said they couldn't get a bag to me until next Wednesday. I relayed this news onto my angry and frustrated neighbours and this afternoon five of us dug our way out using pick axes and shovels. One residents went to Wickes and bought some salt at £8 a bag. Wickes told him they had sold £1500 worth of salt TODAY. Residents have told me how angry they are that they are having to pay for the salt when it should be provided by the Council.\n\"There must be a full and urgent review into the distribution of Salt Bags/Bins in the urban areas of Brentwood as residents shouldn't have to put up with this nonsense again. I look forward to your response.\n\"Regards, David\"",

Thanks to Labour our national debt now stands at £175 billion, they have maxed out the UK PLC's credit cards in an attempt to spend their way out of recession. Someone sooner a later will have to pay for it, but by that time Labour will be long gone, and it will be us, the poor old British tax payer who has to foot the bill.\nThe UK is already £1.3 trillion pounds in personal debt and when the banks start demanding their money back things will really get nasty. I just hope the Government will have enough money left to pay the Citizens Advice Bureau who will be left to pick up the pieces.\nThe truth is that this budget has been a wasted opportunity. Once again they have failed to reform the tax and benefit system or axe Council tax and replace it with a system based on people's ability to pay. It is obscene that under a Labour government the poorest 20% of society pay more tax as a percentage of their income than the richest 20%. Rather than restore the link between pensions and earnings they will put up the meagre state pension by a measly 2.5%. This budget will hit the poorest hardest.\nAnd what have the Conservatives got to offer? More tax cuts for the super rich. Last time they were in power they gave us three and a half million unemployed and Black Wednesday. Not to mention the sale of the century resulting in the privatised monopolies from gas to railways that charge us more and more because they care more about their fat cat shareholders than us their customers.\nThere is only one man with the vision and expertise capable of getting us out of this economic mess and that's highly respected economist , Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor Vince Cable. (You can read Vince's comments on the budget by following the link below).\nThe Lib Dems will take 4 million people out of paying tax altogether and cut most peoples income tax by £700. This will be paid for by closing tax loopholes for the super rich and big business.

  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_disabled-parking-in-brentwood/content_510.html": "Disabled Parking in Brentwood\nIn 2018 I was successful in making Brentwood a 'no tolerance borough' as far as parking in disabled spaces was concerned. No ifs, no buts... if you were parked in a disabled bay without a valid blue badge you got a ticket. It was one of the highlights of my lengthy council career as this was agreed cross-party, unanimously and the result met with a round of applause - unusual for an opposition member! Having been rendered disabled by an accident in 2015, it meant a lot to me as I understood first-hand how vital these accessible and convenient spaces are.\nHowever, despite the initial burst of activity, in the High Street particularly, you would not now know that this was the case.\nI've quietly fought behind the scenes every time our councils have taken out the High Street facility whenever there were works in the area, lest some healthy fit contractors should have to walk a bit, or happily let market traders use the blue badge spaces for loading and unloading. I lost it when Brentwood Council closed half the William Hunter Way blue badge car park for three months, although that resulted in a gain as more spaces were installed permanently in the main car park after my action. I have fumed and lobbied for enforcement at Christmas when the disabled spaces weren't respected, as if Santa brings out new working limbs for disabled folk on Christmas Eve.\nRecently, an email from council officers confirmed that they wouldn't bother to ticket in the High Street during the Covid-19 lockdown at exactly the time disabled people needed them the most. I understand my response may have changed their minds, although they did helpfully suggest we park on double yellow lines (the flaw being that everyone was allowed to).\nBut the latest insensitivity has left me fuming.\nDuring the High Street weekend closures, our Conservative councils of Essex and Brentwood have moved the blue badge parking to St Thomas Road. Let me put that in perspective. A disabled person on disability benefit is unlikely to be able to walk more than 50m, 20m if on high rate benefit. If lucky enough to park outside Starbucks, Boots is 30m away and it becomes possible to collect a prescription, for example, exercising some independence. From St Thomas Road, it's 292m.\nI am unsure whether our local councils don't understand or don't care, but they need to be reminded, clearly, that disability is permanent, it does not take a day off on bank holidays, during maintenance works or pandemics. I wish it would but it does not, and we need our facilities just so life can begin to be equitable.\nCllr Karen Chilvers\nLiberal Democrat",

The process of removing these rights would allow the site to become private. And whilst there would be disabled car parking provision in the development, it would only be close to businesses in the development, and much further away from the High Street. Cllr Philip Mynott and Cllr Barry Aspinell (Lib Dem, Brentwood North) aggressively criticised the decision as 'morally wrong and deeply flawed' as changes to the use and ownership of the car park, which was beyond the foot\nOver the last three years a staggering £0.5 million has been paid out by Conservative run Essex County Council to 1502 residents whose cars have been damaged by potholes on the County's roads.

Significant traction – including an urgent meeting with the new Deputy Prime Minister - has led to over 80 more councils backing their recommendations and signing the final report.\nThis report, led by Southwark Council with contributions from housing policy experts Toby Lloyd and Rose Grayston, sets out a full roadmap to renew our country’s council housing over the next decade and critical policy changes to realise the new government’s social housing ambitions.\nIt explains how an unsustainable financial model and erratic national policy changes have squeezed the council’s housing budgets and sent costs soaring. A new analysis from Savills shows that they will face a £2.2bn ‘black hole’ by 2028.\nThey warn that unless more is done soon, most council landlords will struggle to maintain their existing homes adequately or meet the huge new demands to improve them, let alone build new homes for social rent. Across the country, development projects are being cancelled and delayed, which has huge implications for the local construction sector, jobs, and housing market.\nRather than increasing supply, the reality is that some councils will have no option but to sell more of their existing stock to finance investment in an ever-shrinking portfolio of council homes.\nThe recommendations include urgently restoring lost income and unlocking local authority capacity to work with the new government to deliver its promises for new, affordable homes throughout the country.\nThe five solutions set out detailed and practical recommendations to the new government:\n- A new fair and sustainable HRA model – including an urgent £644 million one-off rescue injection and long-term, certain rent and debt agreements.\n- Reforms to unsustainable Right to Buy policies\n- Removing red tape on existing funding\n- A new, long-term Green & Decent Homes Programme\n- Urgent action to restart stalled building projects, avoiding the loss of construction sector capacity and a market downturn\nThey make a plan for a ‘decade of renewal’, with local authorities and central government working together to get ‘Housing Revenue Accounts’ (HRAs) back on stable foundations, bring all homes up to modern and green standards, and deliver the next generation of council homes.\nCouncillor Vicky Davies, the Deputy Leader of the Council (LD -Pilgrim’s Hatch) who is vice chair of the Health, Housing and Community Committee, said: “As Liberal Democrats, we are deeply conscious of the needs of local families in Brentwood, not least in my ward of Pilgrim’s Hatch, who are waiting anxiously for social housing,”\nI’m also clear, from my casework and those of my fellow Liberal Democrat councillors, that housing stock needs investment, while the financial model for Council housing needs to change.\n“This joint report clearly outlines what is needed to make a difference. We are working with a coalition of councils representing every corner of England, and we are united in our determination to ensure our residents have decent and affordable homes.”\nHaving set out plans to regenerate Council housing with the building of carbon-neutral homes at Brookfield Close, Hutton and Harewood Road, Pilgrims Hatch, which are a welcome increase within our council housing stock, we want to be able to go further and upgrade our council housing and build new social homes for local people.”\nCouncillor Davies concluded: “Our five solutions offer the new government an opportunity to change direction - lifting our council homes to modern, safe, healthy and green standards and delivering the council homes that our communities urgently need. By investing in them together, we can transform lives for the better for generations to come.”",

It split the country almost exactly in half and we are still very divided - and the two main political parties at Westminster in England are ignoring their voters and fighting internally. They appear to be more interested in their own careers rather than providing leadership and direction to the country.\nIf people had been posed the question 'do you think the UK's arrangements with the EU need to be changed?' - I think 99% would have said yes. A similar answer would have resulted if the question had been,'do you want to pay less tax, have a better NHS system, improved infrastructure, better air quality'. Unfortunately, without detailing what actions would be taken after such a vote, making realistic progress would be impossible for any government.\nThe Liberal Democrat approach continues to be not just for the UK to stay inside the EU but to drive real change from within. Voting Liberal Democrat on the 23 May shows that you recognise the one party that has a proper policy on diverse matters at local, national and international level - not just a one item Brexit, UKIP or Change party that does not represent anyone at local council level - nor a divided Conservative or Labour Party.\nAt the local elections on the 2 May I picked up many comments from dissenting Conservative or Labour Party supporters who do not intend to vote at the European Parliament elections because they do not know what their party now stands for. However I, and all the Liberal Democrat councillors and candidates, received numerous comments from Brentwood residents who recognise the efforts made by our local councillors to represent them. And all our MEP candidates share that commitment to represent their communities.\nI hope all Brentwood residents will want their positive views to be heard by voting Liberal Democrat on Thursday 23 May..\nFrank Garbutt, Brentwood Resident & Lib Dem Activist",

In our view any charge should simply be sufficient to cover costs it should not be used as a money making scheme.

It is clearly a two horse race and a race, between Mr Pickles and our candidate Cllr David Kendall, far from won due to a number of factors:\nResidents are not happy with a Tory administration that has, amongst other cataclysmic clangers, dragged Brentwood from one of the top councils in the country under the Liberal Democrats to one of the eleven worst and the worst in Essex. They are, quite rightly, very concerned about how a national Tory government would run the country when such incompetence has been displayed at town hall level.\nMr Pickles' role as Tory Chairman sees him relishing the national stage and he is all over the country working on other campaigns in Great Yarmouth, with ex-Brentwood leader Brandon Lewis, Pendle, Bedford and Norwich to name just a few that I am aware of. Chris Patten, former Tory Chair, lost his seat in the 1997 General Election, when he spent far too much time on the national campaign and far too little time in his constituency. That seat, Bath, is held by Liberal Democrat Don Foster to this day. He was a loyal local councillor and campaigner, just like David Kendall.\nOf course, one might assume that Mr Pickles is busy representing our views in the House of Commons, but www.theyworkforyou.com shows that he has only spoken in TWO debates in the last year (but note that he attended parliament to vote \"very strongly\" for the Iraq war). By contrast, Cllr Kendall has rarely missed a borough or county council meeting at which he was due, attending a number of meetings on crutches in 2008.\nNor are people convinced, especially in these difficult economic times, about the dynamic duo of Cameron and Osborne. Not when you compare this to the combination of Nick Clegg (a recent poll showed he was perceived as the least arrogant and most honest of the three party leaders) and Vince Cable, one of the most widely respected and credible politicians this country has seen.\nThe thing about these polls is that they do not fully represent local opinion and, with people so let down, feelings are running very high.\nLet battle commence!\nCllr Karen Chilvers\nLiberal Democrat General Election Campaign Manager",

Like all health and care services, it needs to be properly staffed.\n- Bring forward a fully funded programme to get people who are medically well enough discharged from hospital and set up with appropriate social care and support. This will allow people to leave hospital sooner and make more space available for new arrivals.\n- The Government's current attempt at this through the Adult Social Care Discharge Fund is not good enough, as the funds will come from existing NHS budgets putting even more pressure on other services. It will also not be deployed in full until January next year.\n- In addition to getting people out of hospital so that they get care in a more comfortable setting, the number of beds in hospitals needs to be increased to end excessive handover delays for ambulances, caused by a lack of bed capacity. Any new beds must come with increases in staff to care for those extra patients.\n- Expand mental health support services to get people the appropriate care they need and reduce the number of call outs for ambulances for mental health reasons. Learning from hospitals that have set up 'emergency mental health departments', will not only to get people more appropriate care but relieve pressure on A&Es and ambulances.\n- Pass Daisy Cooper MP's Ambulance Waiting Times Bill into law that would require accessible, localised reports of ambulance response times to be published. This would ensure that 'hot spots' with some of the longest waiting times can be identified routinely. 12 hour waits at A&E should also be published from arrival at hospital rather than the 'decision to admit' as is current practice, so that the true scale of the problem is clear for all to see.",

They should be carried out for anyone who may come into contact with children prior to commencing working or volunteering for the organisation and take some weeks to process.\nFollowing the meeting, Cllr Chilvers said:\n\"I express my concern over this matter in the strongest of terms, both as an elected councillor representing hundreds of Brentwood families and as the auntie of a three year old boy.\n\"The answer given was that \"most\" volunteers have CRBs in place already, but not everyone. Parents should have confidence that, for a council-run event, adequate checks have been put in place and every measure has been taken to prevent an unfortunate incident occurring. Although a Tory councillor who is volunteering tried to allay fears by saying that she would not be in a position on the night to warrant a CRB check, this is not a protocol that you can half-heartedly apply. Everyone must have a valid and current check in place if there is any chance they should come into contact with children and this is a family event.\n\"Conservative councillors have appealed, both in the local press, radio and on the internet, for volunteers for the event, therefore potentially attracting anyone to such a role. Even if a volunteer is not technically in a position dealing with children, if they are in a yellow jacket and acting as an official then it is more than plausible that a lone child could wander up to them as they are a person in authority who, in their eyes, surely would be seen as a safe person to go to.\n\"CRB checks are also in place to protect the employee/volunteer too and they could be putting themselves in a vulnerable position of facing an accusation.\n\"This is a demonstration of very poor planning.\"\nDocuments also revealed that there is no one person in overall control of the event and that the council does not have a qualified or trained events organiser.",

As a street consisting completely of flats - roughly 800 of them - a solution to the recycling problem does not exist under the new system. Frankly, the flat dwellers of Rollason Way have been forgotten by Brentwood Council, who are now trying to blame the management companies (they were given a fait accompli and they should not be blamed for not dancing to the council's tune) . Interaction with the companies should have happened months before the system was rolled out\".\n\"It is abundantly clear that this system of blue and white bags is set up for people who live in houses with side access and a shed in which to store them. (I'm not even starting on the problems for disabled people or elderly residents to cope with the system).\n\"Rollason Way residents are now left with two options. 1) to independently try to use the blue and white bags or 2) to take their recycling to a \"bring site\" themselves. Both of these options are unacceptable and largely unworkable. This area has low car ownership due to the inadequate parking availability making it impossible to haul rubbish across Warley\".\n\"To even imagine that the blue and white bag system will work here is laughable. There's a big difference between having one bag outside one house and 60 bags outside one front door of a block of flats. This has clearly not been thought through with the flats in mind. The very notion that 60 bags will be successfully returned to their owners in just one block at the end of the day is incredulous.

Commenting afterwards he said:\n\"Whilst we supported the Leader's proposals to reduce allowances given to councillors for the next financial year in an effort to keep the Council tax down, we were unable to support the overall budget because it failed to address a number of serious issues.\n\"Our call to freeze charges for car parking, biodegradable sacks and green waste bins was rejected out of hand and our call to scrap the proposed pest control charge for pensioners and residents on means tested benefit was also dismissed by the Tories.\n\"We believe the Conservatives' failure to listen to the serious concerns expressed by residents and the business community about increasing car parking charges is a big mistake and will come back to haunt them.\n\"A headline grabbing 1.89% council tax increase cannot hide the fact that serious increases in charges and possible cuts in services are going to have to be considered for the years ahead to try and balance the books.\n\"Our residents were looking to the Council for more help during these difficult economic times and this budget fails to address many of their genuine concerns\".",

It is set to be tabled as soon as Parliament returns next week and has been backed by all 72 Liberal Democrat MPs.\nIt comes as new analysis shows an estimated 17,712 pensioners in Brentwood & Ongar are at risk of losing the £300 payment, which helps with heating bills in the cold winter months.\nThis is the estimated number of pensioners in the constituency who don't receive pension credit, and so will lose the winter fuel allowance under the government’s plans unless they receive other benefits. The figures were compiled by the House of Commons Library based on data from the Department of Work and Pensions.\nAcross the country, 11 million pensioners are set to lose their winter fuel payment under the government’s plans, including two million that the charity Age UK has said will struggle to afford their energy bills as a result. This is despite the average energy bill being set to rise by £149 a year from October.\nBrentwood & Ongar Liberal Democrats are urging their local MP, Alex Burghart to back the motion to protect poorer and more vulnerable pensioners from being forced to choose between eating and heating this winter.\nCllr David Kendall said:\n“Countless pensioners across Brentwood & Ongar are worried about losing this vital support and how they will afford their energy bills this winter.\n“Stripping support from many of the poorest pensioners in Brentwood & Ongar just when energy bills are set to rise again is simply wrong. It could force vulnerable elderly people in our community to choose between eating and heating this winter.\n“That is why we are urging our local MP, Alex Burghart to back the Lib Dem motion in Parliament next week and do everything they can to block these plans which could cause immense financial hardship in our area.”",

Cllr Kendall said:\n\"This is the wrong time to be introducing these car parking charges when so many residents and businesses are really suffering with their financial situation.\n\"The free parking in the Town Hall car parks attracted shoppers to the town and gave a boost to the local economy. To start charging now will be another kick in the teeth to many local retailers and businesses.\n\"We are also very concerned about how much residents are going to have to pay to use the car parks at night. In our view any charge should simply be sufficient to cover costs it should not be used as a money making scheme.

Of this number, 75% will need palliative care. Our NHS is already under extreme pressure, particularly in emergency departments, where nearly 30% of admissions are for people in the last year of life, at a cost of £2bn annually. Many of these admissions are preventable, caused by inadequate provision of care in the community that mean people are admitted to hospital unnecessarily and can struggle to leave once they have been admitted.\nThe benefits system is meant to cushion terminally ill people against the financial impact of terminal illness. However, the current rule which requires them to prove they have six months left to live to get fast-track access to benefits means many miss out on the support they need. This rule is opposed by most doctors and nurses and leaves many families struggling to cope with the income loss and additional costs caused by terminal illness.\nOur proposals for the next government will help keep people with a terminal illness out of hospital unless they have a real clinical need to be there and help keep our NHS sustainable - by ensuring that everybody with a terminal illness gets fair and fast access to the benefits they need and are entitled to so they can afford to live at home, and by supporting people to live and be cared for at home or elsewhere in the community.",

You always know when the Tories are getting desperate at election time when you get a glossy leaflet through your door (this one entitled \"SAFEGUARDING BRENTWOOD'S FUTURE\") which is full of articles attacking the local Liberal Democrats.\nYou wouldn't think there were 27 Tories on the Council against only 8 Liberal Democrats. With not long to go before the polls on 5th May anyone would think they were getting worried. Whilst we are used to Tory attacks we feel the need to respond in this particular case as they haven't given residents all the facts. In an effort to provide some balance we have tried to answer their claims below.\nLib Dem FACT: The Liberal Democrat group did not attempt to block a freeze in the Council tax for this year.\nWe simply asked for separate votes on different parts of the Tory budget as there were some areas we were more than happy to support. However our request was refused.\nLeader Cllr David Kendall then made it quite clear that the Lib Dems supported the freeze on the Council tax and the cut in members allowances (as can clearly be seen on the Council's webcast recording). However we could not support the overall budget because of a number of cuts to local services and for that reason we voted against. Our budget was not made up on the back of an envelope. All our alternative budget proposals were carefully costed and checked by the two most senior finance officers at the Borough Council prior to the meeting. We knew exactly how much our proposals would cost local residents and would be more than happy to discuss them in detail with any residents who are interested.\nTory headline: KEEPING THE TOWN HALL IN THE TOWN CENTRE\nTory Claim: \"The Liberal Democrats want to waste an extra £660,000 every year under their plans to \"redecorate\" the existing offices. They also want the council to become property speculators risking your money on building new offices to let\".\nLib Dem FACT: \"We have consistently been against the demolition of the Town Hall. We would like to see a major programme of renovation and refurbishment of the existing building which would include upgrading the windows, boiler, roof and wall insulation to a good standard. Whilst we have had costings from the officers for this work, they were unable to confirm what the running costs would be once all the work had been completed. Consequently the £660,000 cost quoted by the Tories is certainly news to us. The Lib Dems do not want the council to become property speculators and we have NO plans to build new offices to let. All we have said is that we would let any spare space in a renovated Town Hall to local groups or businesses if it wasn't required by Council staff.\nTory headline: LIB DEM \"NIGHT TIME TOWN TAX\" SHOCK\nTory claim: Lib Dem parking proposals \"would force visitors to park in residential roads to avoid a £3 evening parking charge. The Lib Dems suddenly proposed this new fee at a recent council budget setting meeting without thinking through the appalling consequences\".\nLib Dem FACT: Our parking proposals were fully costed and checked by the two most senior finance officers at the Borough Council before the meeting. We believe there needs to be more fairness between the day time and night time car parking charges and so do many retailers in the town who back our plans. That is why we proposed a reduction in the first hour of parking during the day from 80p to 40p and a new evening charge of £3 to help pay for it. We also had proposals to increase the level of evening and weekend parking enforcement in the town centre but the Tories blocked our move to discuss this and our other proposals that would have benefited local residents. It costs £10 to park all day in the town centre car parks. Under our proposals it would cost £3 to park all night - less than a price of a pint.\nWe would also make clear that these are proposals and we would consult with residents widely before anything is introduced - and we would listen too.\nTory headline: KEEPING OUR HOMES SAFE FIGHTING THE FIRE CUTS\nTory Claim: \"Liberal Democrats decided to campaign to keep the library open on a Sunday, instead of fighting to save our fire service and protect homes and businesses.\nLib Dem FACT: The Tories conveniently forgot to mention that it is their own Conservative colleagues who run the Essex Fire Authority with a very large majority (16/20 members are Tories). Local Tories in Brentwood failed to convince their colleagues against making changes to Brentwood's Fire Service. They even failed to convince their County Council colleague in Hutton who sits on the Fire Authority and showed his active support for the Fire Authority changes with a letter to the local paper.

Large organisations like BT and Mellon Bank were encouraged to come to Brentwood and we introduced innovative parking schemes like the \"Cash Back\" scheme. In more recent times we have given our support to the new Brentwood First business initiative but we hold our hands up and admit we have been very critical of the Tories car parking policies and issues like the Lighting up Brentwood Xmas event.

There are many District and Borough Councils across Essex and all the other County Councils in the East of England that have had such a permanent and designated spot for members of the public for several years. We are only asking for something that the public is getting already from most other councils anyway, yet the Conservatives at County Hall chose instead to continue to gag the public of Essex.\n\"The Council really must improve its public engagement to demonstrate it wants Essex residents and council taxpayers to be included in the democratic process in a real and meaningful way. There is no direct public involvement at the decision-making level of the County Council and the public is only involved when specifically invited in. This was the acid test for the Conservatives to show, in practical terms, that they are interested in hearing and responding to what the public has to say; sadly they failed.\n\"The Conservative talk of localism and devolvement of power to the people is clearly just talk. The Conservatives are simply not to be trusted on this issue.\"",

Despite a cross-party working group spending years working with businesses and local services to share the building, it would seem that, meanwhile, the Conservatives were working away in the background to sell the building as soon as they could get away with it.\nWhat is more worrying is that no-one from the Accord Administration commissioned the report during their time in office (June 2014 - May 2015) and, yet, the report is dated 20th April 2015 leaving some very serious questions about how the report came to be compiled.\nThe report concludes that\n\"...there is a compelling case for pursuing a sale of the existing Town Hall for residential purposes and relocating the Council offices into a purpose built new facility in the northern car park.\"\nwhich is completely at odds with the wishes of many residents who live in the town.\nCllr Barry Aspinell, leader of the Lib Dems on Brentwood Council and council leader at the time this report was commissioned, said:\n\"I had absolutely no knowledge of this report being commissioned so it is quite clear that I didn't commission it.

  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_our-statement-on-discount-taxis-for-girls-in-short-skirts/content_1280.html": "Our statement on “Discount Taxis for Girls in Short Skirts”\nBrentwood Lib Dems distance themselves from Tory councillor's comments\nTory councillor Chris Hossack has caused a national media storm by describing Brentwood as a \"meat market\", says ITV's \"The Only Way is Essex\" is responsible for many of the town's problems and verbally maligned its star, Amy Childs, wants to start a taxi-fare discount scheme for \"scantily clad young girls\" and says Brentwood at night is a \"cheap thrill\" and that \"girls….have too much on show\" and could get attacked as a result.\nUnfortunately, these careless comments have seen Brentwood made a laughing stock in the national press with stories in The Daily Mail, Mirror, Sun and Telegraph focusing on Cllr Hossack's comments about \"Cheaper taxis if you wear a mini skirt\".\nRead the Brentwood Gazette's stories:\nTOWIE puts women at risk of sexual assault\nPoll: Should women get cheaper taxis?\nThe Liberal Democrat Group on Brentwood Council wishes to completely distance itself from the comments made by Cllr Chris Hossack, which are now being quoted as the policy/potential policy of Brentwood Council. Last month, we actually tabled a motion for a strategy for our night time economy, which the Tories voted against and have instead tried to grab the headlines by this policy which, clearly, they thought would be popular. Although there is some credibility in a \"safe area\" similar to safety buses used in some city centres we are not aware of a wide spread problem of young people - of either gender - being attacked in our town. The issues with town centre behaviour - as borne out by those interviewed in this week's Brentwood Gazette - have been litter, noise, urinating in the street and later and later opening hours.\nThese comments show little understanding of the issues actually experienced by town centre residents and as a group, we are appalled by much of what he has said.\nCllr Hossack blames the \"TOWIE\" culture for the way girls are dressed and feels females who are scantily dressed should get discounted taxi fares to make sure they get safely home.\nAs Liberal Democrats we believe anyone, male or female, should be able to dress as they wish. The attitude that a girl will get attacked because of the way she is dressed is woefully out-of-date and belongs in the pages of history books and 1970s police dramas, not Brentwood in 2013. The chances of getting attacked apply equally to males and females and policies on taxi fares should also apply equally. We also feel many of our local taxi drivers would use or have used their discretion to help someone. Incidentally, the taxi trade has not been consulted on this issue.\nThis policy, if implemented, could work in reverse with preferences for fares going to men because they will pay the full amount. It could also mean that people dress \"scantily\" to get a lower fare. In short, this is a totally unworkable policy with even the Daily Mail calling it \"bizarre\".\nWe are also disappointed that this sort of attitude still prevails today in the Conservative Group and have asked the council leader, Louise McKinlay, whether she stands by Cllr Hossack's comments. At time of writing, we have had no response.\nCllr Hossack also asserts that there is \"money set aside\" for this scheme and we have asked when, where and who approved this.\nWe have also asked officers in which capacity (council/individual/party) this statement was made by Cllr Hossack.\nWe also recognise that TOWIE, whatever your personal opinion of the show, has brought new business into the town and made Brentwood a destination for weekends away and are disturbed at the Tory councillor's verbal attack on Amy Childs and her well-intentioned ambition to be a role model for young people.\nIt should also be noted that many of the establishments allowed to open late have been approved by Tory councillors and opposed by Liberal Democrat councillors.\nCllr Hossack's lack of understanding of the main issues in Brentwood's night time culture is now of concern to a number of opposition councillors and we have to question whether he is the right person to lead the working party on the night time economy.",

Should our status change in May we would look to work within this budget - until we've set our own.\nWe would also state that we agree with keeping Council Tax to the recommended 0% increase. At the current time, this is the very least we can do\nfor our residents, especially those who have faced unexpected financial challenges through no fault of their own. We request a separate vote relating\nto that part of the Agenda.\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to remind the Conservative administration why we will not be supporting their budget.\nIt seems that Conservative Party ideas nationally, at County level and locally are similar in certain respects and all have a bearing on our budget. Worryingly none of these three levels of authority appear to be serious in addressing climate change, undoubtedly the single most important issue that is threatening our future.\nGreat play was made when announcing the introduction of a Climate Change Commission only to subsequently discover that this body effectively had no\nteeth whatsoever and planning officers have no power, under the law, to insist on climate change initiatives being included in applications before them.\nWe have put forward Motions for deliberation at both County and Borough levels which go some small way towards addressing climate issues but these have either been agreed at council meeting level, with no further commitment taking effect, or simply dismissed at the presentation stage. This lack of interest is disappointing, more so when our local Tory administration, whilst declaring their commitment to green initiatives, have little, or no tangible evidence to show for it.\nAdditionally, we cannot overlook the disastrous affect on our town of Government legislation in allowing office blocks to be redeveloped into residential homes under permitted development rights. As a result, we have potentially lost millions of pounds of S106 monies desperately needed to support the\ninfrastructure required for the additional schools , doctor's surgery places and highway improvements to address the additional vehicle journeys new residents will generate.\nLocal authorities do have the power to control office conversions under Article 4 Directives, but despite the Lib Dem Group's requests for such Directives to be placed on the recently vacated Ford's building and others within the borough, they have either been ignored or considered unworthy of progression. Yet another opportunity to do the best for our residents has been missed courtesy of Conservative legislation and inaction.\nThe Lib Dem Group have, over the past year, made constructive efforts to put forward ideas for the enhancement of the Council's budget and to highlight deficiencies contained within those Conservative proposals where we believe an impact ranging from negative, up to a catastrophic outcome could result if approved. In this respect, we welcome the Council's recent change of direction in seeking local acquisitions to not only bolster our future finances, but to strengthen opportunities for our local workforce.\nWe strongly believe that this approach is more risk adverse than chasing opportunities located outside the Borough, especially where the perceived benefits are far outweighed by the high level of financial risk attached. Such acquisitions, whilst looking attractive at first sight, are fraught with risks well beyond the capability of a local authority, or the understanding of many of those tasked on voting for such proposals.\nThankfully, the Government has recognised a pattern of excessive, uncontrolled risk being taken by local authorities, some of whom have now declared themselves bankrupt and, as a result, has amended regulations governing the types of investment that can, and cannot be entered into. To our relief, this\naction alone has, very recently, prevented the Tory administration, shamefully supported by Labour members, from committing Brentwood residents to a potentially disastrous, long-term financial burden.\nWe must explore seriously, sensibly and most importantly responsibly, those initiatives that can benefit our town through the promotion of economic growth and the much needed income generation essential for the continuation of our services.\nHowever it may be that the aspirations of our Tory administration and their Labour member supporters need to rethink our involvement with the Association of South Essex Local Authorities. This highly publicised (although not altogether transparent) initiative sought to combine Basildon, Brentwood, Castle Point, Rochford and Southend-on-Sea, as a mega-authority with ambitions of transforming the South Essex region into an economic power house. Much resource has been wasted on this unwanted project and following the recent announcement that Basildon and Thurrock Councils have changed their minds and now want to form an enlarged unitary authority together, we say, we must concentrate our efforts on our residents living in our borough.\nTurning to the future Madam Deputy Mayor, we would like to remind this Council of Lib Dem initiatives that have been put forward.\nSome seven years ago, we had the forethought to put forward suggestions that the formation of a Local Authority Trading Company be created. This was dismissed, even ridiculed, regularly by the Conservative administration under the guise that local authorities should not dabble in such things. One Tory councillor even commented that it was something that should be administered within the private sector only and that the suggestion was almost communistic in its approach! However, SAIL was formed, albeit very late in the day, and this has resulted in the Council being able to show a balanced set of accounts. Without the benefit of this vehicle it would have been extremely difficult to bridge our funding gap. We had also suggested that the Council should look within the Borough for land acquisitions so that opportunities were given to our residents for local employment resulting in monies being spent within our borough benefiting our Council.\nGoing forward we would like to see a strategy that will support our Town Centre, our residents and our new homes requirement.\nWe would like to see the Bay Tree Centre refurbished, as proposed. We would then wish to secure the William Hunter Way car park as a car park to support that refurbished and re-energised High Street and would demand the Council seek possession of the Wates Way site for the provision of most of the homes previously identified by the Conservatives on our town centre car parks.\nRobbing Peter to pay Paul has run its time in Brentwood - our residents deserve better.\nCllr Barry Aspinell has been a Brentwood ward councillor for over 30 years, representing first Brentwood North and then Pilgrims Hathch since 2006.

However, in the light of strong representations made by many businesses and residents against the closure, this decision has been reversed and the High Street reopened. Many businesses felt the closure was adversely affecting their trade, particularly drop offs and pick ups. Many residents had concerns about the buses still using the High Street and no access for disabled parking (see Cllr Karen Chilvers article here). Residents were also concerned about the significant increase in the volume of traffic and vehicle emissions in affected town centre roads together with concerns about large lorries using weight limited diversion routes.\nWe support the decision to reopen the High Street because we don't believe permanent pedestrianisation of the High Street 24/7 was ever a realistic option due to the road infrastructure in our town centre being unable to\ncope. However we do believe some important lessons can be learnt from this whole experience. Going forward the County and Borough Councils are now proposing to make the High Street a traffic free pedestrianised environment only on a Sunday between the hours of 8am - 6pm. The view is that this will make the High Street a more relaxed family friendly environment for one day of the week with access only for disabled parking.\nWe support this move but appreciate the decision still has to be confirmed and funding found to deliver it.",

Following its declaration of a climate emergency in June 2023, the Council has transitioned 56 of its vehicles, including waste trucks, to run on Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), a sustainable alternative to diesel fuel.\nBrentwood is the first council in Essex to fully switch to HVO, alongside its growing fleet of seven electric vans. This cleaner fuel, made entirely from certified waste materials like vegetable oils and waste fats, reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 99% compared to traditional diesel and cuts nitrous oxide emissions by 25%, improving air quality.\nHVO offers a practical and cost-effective solution to reducing emissions, requiring no major modifications to existing diesel vehicles. It’s also a more sustainable option than traditional fuels, as it uses materials that would otherwise end up in landfills, contributing to environmental harm.\nThe Leader of Brentwood Borough Council and Chair of the Clean and Green Committee, Councillor Barry Aspinell said, “This is a really exciting initiative. Switching to more environmentally friendly fuels will have a very positive effect on air quality and provide enormous benefits to our residents. The move to HVO demonstrates our commitment to addressing climate change and improving local air quality, all while ensuring that essential waste collection services remain reliable and efficient. While the Council is taking this brilliant step, we hope to encourage the private sector to join us in transforming their petrol or diesel-fueled vehicles to alternative energy sources. This initiative is a key part of the Council’s broader ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, paving the way for a cleaner, greener future for Brentwood”",

At the time, I was like many other people whose vote could have easily gone either way. In the end, I voted leave with a heavy heart because - based on all the information provided - I thought we would probably be better off out of the EU. However as time has passed I am prepared to admit I got it wrong.\nI now see the whole EU saga as a bit like buying a house.\nWhen you go to buy a house it's easy to be taken in by all it visually has to offer. It's only when you have the house survey done that you can get some nasty suprises and realise some key issues that you weren't aware of before. The survey on the EU has now been done and we all have far more facts and information at our disposal than we ever had before. Back in 2016 I don't remember anyone talking about the 'Irish Backstop' but now it's a major stumbling block in trying to agree a deal. I have also seen many other things promised by the Leave campaign that have not materialised. Most people now accept that trying to break away from an institution we have been a member of for over forty years is not as easy as some would like us to believe. The reality is even if this Government manages to secure a deal, this whole Brexit saga is going to keep on running for many years to come as this is the start of the process not the end.\nWhilst the result of the EU referendum was for the UK to leave, it didn't say on what basis. If a deal can be found that commands a majority in Parliament then Brexit will happen. However I am not convinced that it will be possible to get a majority for a deal. There is clearly no majority in Parliament for a no deal Brexit. Consequently the most sensible option must be to go back to the people with a second referendum and put 'the deal' up against the poption of staying in the EU. Parliament must then accept the result of the second referendum and put this matter to bed once and for all.\nThe EU is far from perfect and certainly needs reforming but I am now firmly of the view that we should definitely remain in the EU and reform it from within.\nThe Liberal Democrat position on Brexit\n- We are totally opposed to a 'no deal Brexit' that would cause immeasurable damage to our NHS, the supplies of medicine, jobs and the environment.\n- We will continue to fight in Parliament for an \"exit from Brexit\" referendum and for the public to choose between \"the deal\" or staying in the EU; with the Liberal Democrats campaigning for the UK to remain a full an active member of the EU.\n- At the General Election we will campaign to stop Brexit and if a Liberal Democrat majority government is elected we will recognise it as an unequivocal mandate to revoke article 50 and for the UK to stay in the EU.",

  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_case-proven-we-really-do-need-to-tackle-air-pollution/content_410.html": "Case Proven: We really do need to tackle air pollution\nLast month I wrote about the case of Ella Kissi-Debrah and the fact that a South London coroner's court was holding an inquest into the death of the nine-year-old. As a reminder this was a potential landmark legal case, a coroner was being asked to rule that air pollution caused the death from an acute asthma attack. This finding would make legal history. It has never been identified as a cause of death before in the UK and this is thought to be the first case of its kind in the world. Lewisham Council, the mayor of London and government gave evidence about their knowledge of the levels of toxic air around where Ella lived, the health impacts and what was being done to reduce the pollution. Prior to the inquest It had been decided that article 2 - the right to life - of the Human Rights Act, which scrutinises the role of public bodies in a person's death, apply to the hearing.\nIn that first article I welcomed the fact that Brentwood Council were recommending removing the three Air Quality Management Areas (AMQA) but noted there was a lack of proactive work done that saw these removed. Instead the case for revoking seemed to rest on weather conditions affecting readings and the proposed extension of the London Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) from\nCentral London out to the North Circular boundary. I believe that district councils, like Brentwood, will need to start to be more proactive in their management of air quality. By proactive, I mean there will need to start being visible management and measures taking place. The reason why I believe that things must change is due to the findings last month by the coroner that air pollution was to blame for Ella's death.\nThis, I believe, places district councils front and centre in the battle for improving air quality. Ella's mother, Rosamund, led a long fight for the truth. Her fight may well now set the path that helps to prevent others suffering from the health problems that come from poor air quality. If local leaders at both political and local authority officer level do not want to find themselves in court discussing how their actions, or inaction, directly led to deaths then obvious actions will have to be taken.\nAt Ella's hearing government departments, officials from the local authority and the Mayor of London were questioned about what they did - or did not do - to reduce illegal air pollution levels around the area Ella lived. Crucially, they were interrogated about whether they informed the public of the risk to their lives from the air they were breathing, and whether their failings might have\nbreached Ella's right to life.\nSadly, we now have a name and a face that we can put to the human life cost of air pollution. Make no mistake, there may be currently one person with air pollution cited as a causation of their death but Ella certainly isn't the only one and unless things change quickly, she won't be the last.\n1952 was the last time we had a new clean air act - this helped clear the London smogs. A new similar law is required, this time targeted Nitrogen Dioxide and other pollutants associated with modern vehicle and industrial emissions. Campaign group, 'Clean Air London,' is one of the first groups to be calling for a new clean air act to be called Ella's Law. I suspect that they will not be the\nlast.\nWhat Ella's case has made clear is that it is the duty of the Government to protect life. To do this Local Authorities that are responsible for dealing with present air pollution must start to act. At the very least local authorities will need to inform residents when air quality falls below statutory levels.\nBrentwood Liberal Democrats have a very clear position. We must now start to make local changes to improve air quality. This is not a question of reaching legal minimums, it is about ensuring heathy streets. The Healthy Streets Approach is a system of policies and strategies to deliver a healthier, more inclusive urban area where people choose to walk, cycle and use public transport. We will work to put in place infrastructure that will encourage cycling, walkable neighbourhoods and safer school streets. We will encourage more active travel, improving physical health and wellbeing, reducing congestion and pollution. The Liberal Democrats will be proactive on air quality.\nGary MacDonnell is Chair of Brentwood Liberal Democrats and our candidate for the 2021 Borough Council election for Shenfield Ward.

If this Government did understand, it would immediately include three bills in the Queen's Speech:\n\"First, a Parliamentary Privileges Bill, as recommended by a cross-party committee nearly ten years ago, setting out clearly what the rights are of Members of this House and under what exceptional circumstances those rights can be curtailed.\n\"Second, a Civil Service Bill to ensure our civil service is as impartial as it should be, and is always protected from undue political pressure.\n\"And, third, a Bill to restore protection for whistleblowers who act in the public interest. We need to bring back the whistleblower protections that this Government, and its predecessor, abolished.\n\"This isn't just about the arcane Westminster belief in parliamentary privilege, a term most people have never heard of and probably care about even less. It's about defending the simple principle that anyone wanting to unearth information about the way this Government runs things on our behalf should not live in fear of having the anti-terror police at their door.\n\"This should not be a fight amongst Parliamentarians. It's a fight to protect every citizen's right to tell the truth about our Government - no matter who gets embarrassed.\n\"Mr Speaker, today was a tremendous opportunity. It has been a truly terrible year for millions of people - and they are out there waiting.\nAnticipating. Saying, asking, pleading - please, help us.\n\"The Prime Minister has been telling them he's just like Churchill. The Business Secretary says he's like Moses. So people have the right to expect big things - a tablet of stone to fix their problems.\n\"But all they've got is this meagre piece of paper, dressed up as a solution.\n\"This is a time of unprecedented economic crisis. People need a big helping hand. But these are the same old ideas they came up with in the pre-Queen's Speech in May.\n\"Hasn't the Government noticed that times have changed? The non-stop drumbeat of initiatives from this Government has become like legislative musak - an irritating hum in the background, of no use or help to anyone.\n\"The Government is hyperactive in places where it should pause for breath, and inactive in all the areas where it should do something. It acts where it shouldn't, it fails to act where it should.\n\"How else can the Government justify tabling legislation that will give police the power to check the identity of every British citizen, smuggling in Identity Cards by the back door - while doing nothing to get people's energy bills down.\n\"How on earth can the Government justify a 26th criminal justice Bill - more tough talk, more criminal offences, yet public fear of crime still on the rise - while it doesn't mention the word 'housing' once in the Queen's Speech, an area of policy crying out for urgent Government action?\n\"This is a speech from a fag-end Government which is running out of ideas.\n\"The Queen's Speech ran to 650 words. Proposing 14 Bills.\nYet not one of those Bills will help build one extra social home. Not one will put a single penny in the pocket of people in need. Not one will lower a single family fuel bill.\n\"Rarely has so much been promised, and so little delivered.\n\"These are strange political times. After a generation of political cross-dressing. Labour trying to be Conservative-lite. The Tories trying to be cuddly and green. The parties are back in their corners again.\n\"And we remember why Labour and Conservatives have failed Britain so many times in the past. That lot want to run everything and that lot want us to do nothing. It's a terrible choice. A choice between the wrong direction - and backwards.\n\"The Government's determination to do very little is only surpassed by the Conservative determination to do even less. Listening to the Rt Hon member for Witney, I still don't know what he'd actually do.\n\"The Conservatives seem to be planning to slash spending from 2010 when the recession may still be bearing down on millions of people struggling to make ends meet. And they call this 'being responsible'.\n\"The Conservatives - responsible for some of the worst recessions Britain has ever seen - trying to steal the cloak of prudence.\n\"We know Labour imagines the recession is good for their poll ratings. But the Conservatives seem to think a recession is good for our health.\n\"Labour may be fiddling while Rome burns. But the Conservatives would prefer to hide the fire engines.\n\"What could this have been? Mr Speaker, the Queen's Speech should be offering hope where there is fear, reassurance where there is uncertainty.\n\"The Prime Minister should be offering big, permanent and fair tax cuts for ordinary people and families, to put money back in their pockets, funded by closing the multi-billion pound loopholes that benefit only the very rich and big business.\n\"Releasing local authorities from Whitehall rules so that they can borrow against their assets, buy up unsold properties and turn them into social housing, complete unfinished housing projects, and provide affordable homes to the thousands of families without a permanent roof over their heads.\n\"He should be forcing the banks to lend money on fair terms to small businesses and families - and making it quite clear that if the banks cannot be made to act, the Government will lend directly itself.\n\"Instead of the tiny VAT cut that no-one will notice, he should be creating a big programme of green investment to create jobs, stimulate the economy, and set Britain up for a more sustainable future.\n\"And finally, Mr Speaker, he should be forcing energy companies to charge fairly for heating and lighting our homes, so that a pensioner trying to heat just a single room is no longer paying more for her units of energy than a millionaire heating five floors of a mansion.\n\"But the Prime Minister has done none of these things. He's just offering us more of the same, tired old ideas. A banking reform Bill that won't stop repossessions. A local government Bill that won't free councils to invest in homes for people who need them. An education Bill that won't save apprenticeships. And more tub-thumping populism on law and order that won't cut crime.\n\"Why is the Prime Minister marching about the world, trying to be chancellor-in-chief of every country there is? He's supposed to be running Britain. He's supposed to be helping ordinary British families. Not congratulating himself that he's having a good recession.\n\"The Prime Minister is showing hubris when what we need is humility.\nWhat people want is less of his arrogance, and more of his help.\n\"Mr Speaker, it's clear today it isn't just Britain's economy that's broken.\nPolitics is broken, too.\n\"And this isn't just depressing - it's dangerous. Economic crises breed discontent, anger and frustration.\n\"People need solutions, but all they see here is pantomime. A Government with the support of just 22% of the voters. Stumbling through a crisis much of which was its own making. Ramming through laws against all opposition. Deaf to all criticism. Blind to all dissent.\n\"People will give up on politics. No wonder more people stayed at home at the last two general elections than voted for the winning party.\n\"If this was a truly reforming Government, the Queen's Speech would be reforming politics, as well as the economy. Getting big money out of party politics. Changing the unfair, undemocratic electoral system. Devolving power away for where it is hoarded in Westminster and Whitehall. We got none of this.\n\"Today's Government programme is just political pantomime - plenty of bright colours and bad jokes, but very little substance. Labour's run out of ideas. It is clearer today than ever that Britain needs a new, different Government. A different political beginning. That's what the Liberal Democrats will deliver.\"",

Said Dr Cable:\n\"Northern Rock nationalisation - it was clear to us that this was unavoidable in November last year. It took the Government until February to act.\nIndependence of the Bank of England - longstanding Lib Dem policy. First Labour implemented it, over Tory opposition. Now even the Tories support it.\nRecapitalisation of the banks - Three days after the Lib Dems called for this, the Chancellor announced that it would be going ahead.\nTackling the bonus culture - in May we were the first party to put forward proposals for tackling the harmful bonus culture in the financial sector. By the autumn, ministers and the Tory leadership had realised the situation was indefensible and changed their tune.\nRegulation of 'sale and rent back' agreements - this was part of our '7 point plan' for dealing with personal debt, launched in September 2003. The Government announced on 22nd October this year that they were finally looking into this.\nNew court guidance to make repossession a 'last resort', obliging lenders to exhaust all alternatives first - another measure in the Government's 22nd October announcement that the Lib Dems had been calling for for more than six months.\nChanges to capital adequacy laws to require banks to hold more capital in periods of boom and less in recession - we called for this back in January 2003. Now the Conservatives back it too.\nBan on short selling of financial stocks - Lib Dems called for this on September 16th (having also raised the issue in July). The Government did not act until three days later, once the Americans had announced restrictions.\nNational network of financial advice centres - since 2003 we have been calling for a network of local and generic financial advice, particularly for those on lower incomes, funded by a levy on the financial services industry. Earlier this year the Tories announced their support for this too, using almost exactly the same language.\nCurbs on irresponsible lending - a commonplace sentiment now, but we called for \"the publication by the Government of strict measures for responsible lending, which lenders must be required to observe\" back in September 2003.",

  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_cllr-mark-lewis-my-first-18-months-as-a-councillor/content_481.html": "Cllr Mark Lewis: My first 18 months as a councillor\nAs we head into 2021, I thought I would write a short account of my first 18 months as a publically elected councillor for Brentwood North ward.\nI was elected in May 2018 by a margin of 34%. The voting day and counting night was very exciting and was the culmination of about 6 months of preparing my candidacy which included a lot of knocking on doors and putting leaflets through letter boxes. It was actually a lot of fun meeting and chatting to the residents of Brentwood North...not only telling them about myself and my political and practical thoughts but, more importantly, listening to what they thought, what their concerns and issues were.\nAs I entered elected office for the first time, I was quite nervous, wondering how I could best fulfil my public duties and do my best for the residents of Brentwood North. Fortunately, Brentwood council runs a series of \"training sessions\" and member's information meetings which I was able to attend. At the same time, my fellow LibDem councillors were extremely helpful in giving me the benefit of their extensive experience so that I was able to understand the practical requirements of being a good councillor. Slowly, over time, I have been able to get a better understanding of the key issues involved in local government and what it means to be a better councillor.\nThere are three key aspects in being a local councillor. First, helping residents with their personal issues. Some are \"daily life\" type problems and others are much more serious in nature. Second, holding the ruling party, currently, the Tories to account to ensure that they manage the political affairs of Brentwood in the best interests of its residents. This is mainly done by participation on the Brentwood council committees. I currently represent the LibDems on the Policy, Resources & Economic Development (\"PRED\") and Audit & Scrutiny committees. This involves a lot of reading of papers and proposals and making sure that the Tories are held to account for their actions - the papers can often extend to 150-200 pages of quite complex and detailed matters. I then have to take a view on what I have read and draw some practical conclusions as to whether the proposals or ideas contained are appropriate or not. If not, I have to explain why and perhaps create alternative proposal or idea suggestions. After the May 2021 elections, I hope that the Lib Dem's will take political control of the council and I will take a much more proactive role in the running of Brentwood Council.The third and final aspect is contributing to the strategy and development of Brentwood Council...this might include, for example, residential housing strategy, the future of Brentwood's car parks and libraries or how Brentwood Council invests its money for the future...there are many aspects and clearly this involves quite a lot of thinking.\nWhat have I learned so far?\nBeing a local politician is quite a demanding role and modern day issues are complex!\nThe councillor role is actually part time with no salary (although there is a small fixed expenses allowance) but to be a good councillor involves making available time, time to listen, time to solve problems in a well thought through manner...and importantly, not to give up, to use best efforts for a successful resolution of a problem or issue.\nThe residents of Brentwood have many needs and a wide range of problems to solve. So far, with \"resident\" or \"daily life\" problems, I have been able to help with a wide range of matters and requests including (but not limited to) homeless person situations, broken pavement requests, overgrown trees, the disposal of sharp needles, neighbour disputes, new gates for a Brentwood local social organisation, major planning development and licensing issues (e.g. Lidl and town centre night club hours) and individual planning requests and so on. It is a real pleasure when I can genuine make someone's life a bit better. I am always willing to help when approached and, amongst other means, I try to use my knowledge of Brentwood organisations and council personnel and procedures to help solve the issues at hand. It can be a bit frustrating when it is not possible to achieve a full result, for example, financial cuts which mean Essex County Council do not have the means to make-up all the potholes or finish all the tree-cutting on a timely basis. However, I always try to do my best!\nI have participated actively in Brentwood Council committees. After ten years of Tory central government cuts of funding to local authorities, the problems of Brentwood Council are quite difficult to solve with the many cuts to council services and projects. It has been interesting to see the range of methods and solutions used to try to solve for these problems. The Tories have now been in power at Brentwood Council for a decade and, in my view, have managed Brentwood's affairs during this time in a rather incompetent manner. Examples include the closure of the Brentwood Centre due to the insolvency of the Brentwood Leisure Trust, the failure to execute a sensible Local Development Plan after over a decade of discussion and the approval of secret and risky investment schemes which could bankrupt the town. Brentwood also has one of the worst pollution rates of any town in Essex - a record of shame, quite honestly.\nI think it is time for a fresh breath of political air. Brentwood deserves a more intelligent and well thought through approach to its problems and future\nI have worked with my LibDem colleagues on policy and strategy - the issues involved can be complex and challenging. The Tory record over the last decade has largely been one of stagnation, incompetence, and failure. I hope that after May 2021's local elections, my colleagues and I will have the opportunity to put our well thought through policies into action. If Brentwood is to survive and prosper through the current covid-19 crisis and into the next generation, it needs a significant upgrade in political leadership. The Tories simply do not have the skills and competence - from the experience of both my 18 months as a councillor for Brentwood north and my professional business background that much is very clear. The residents of Brentwood deserve more.\nIt is also clear that Brentwood Council has many hard working, dedicated and focused workers - I see this across my activities as councillor whether through residents' \"daily issues\", committee or policy and strategic matters - for this, the residents of Brentwood should be grateful.\nWe are now in the middle of a unique situation, the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone's lives have been affected, many in a serious way. I cannot even begin to describe the issues in a full manner. I hope that the vaccine programme will mean we can begin to look at the future with greater hope. The impacts and reverberations of COVID-19 will undoubtedly be with us for a long time. Being a councillor during this time has been difficult although the use of IT technology has greatly eased the communication challenges and, notwithstanding the lockdown and tier issues, I have continued to try and do my best. I can also clearly see that Brentwood Council staff and the residents of Brentwood North have tried their best to rise to the challenges of this terrible issue.\nOverall, the past 18 months have been an interesting experience. Challenging, yes; frustrating at times, yes; but am I disappointed, no. When I can solve a problem for a resident of Brentwood North, it makes the effort worthwhile.\nFinally, my councillor hopes for 2021? I will definitely continue my efforts for the residents of Brentwood North so, first and foremost, the end of COVID-19, second, the end of incompetent tory rule in Brentwood and third, an opportunity to put my capabilities and experiences to better use after the May 2021 local elections as part of a newly elected political leadership in Brentwood.\nMark Lewis is councillor for Brentwood North ward and can be contacted on mark.lewis@brentwoodlibdems.org.uk",

However their calls were rejected on the grounds of road safety issues, cost and the low numbers of reported accidents. They were told that the only safe solution for both junctions would be the installation of solid island roundabouts which would cost anything between £500k and £1 million each because of the re-routing of wiring and cabling under the road and the need to purchase land. At present there wasn't that level of funding available and even if there was there were not sufficient numbers of reported accidents by the police to justify the investment. Consequently both schemes were well down the list for any action being taken.\nThe police said there had been four accidents at the Sandpit Lane/Ongar Road junction over the last three years and eight accidents at the Devils Head crossroads over the last three years.\nHowever they did get agreement from the Cabinet member to try and get the VAS signs at the Devil's Head crossroads working as soon as possible and for some road linings to be repainted and road signs to be replaced. They also got commitment for a report to be provided by officers on why a mini roundabout was a viable road safety option up in Ongar but not at these two dangerous junctions.\nCllr David Kendall said:\n\"I had hoped we would make some progress on getting some major road safety measures at these dangerous junctions but sadly it wasn't to be. Councillors and residents believe that the installation of mini roundabouts would make a major difference but officers refuse to sanction their use on the grounds of road safety. We were also staggered at the reported accident figures by the police and are now questioning their criteria for what constitutes an accident as we are aware of many many more. We will continue to keep on fighting for the changes that are needed but the clear message from the County Council is that there will be no major improvements at these dangerous junctions for many years to come\".",

One of these options is nuclear power.\nIt was whilst I was looking at the consultation process for the new Nuclear Power Station at Bradwell that I realised how limited the Government's consultation actually was. The Government says it wants to hear Essex residents' views but it has only set up three exhibition dates and two public discussion events in West Mersea, Maldon and, of course, Bradwell on Sea. But there is nothing at all for the rest of Essex.\nWhilst I fully support exhibitions and public meetings for those residents who would be directly effected by the new Nuclear Power Station I also believe residents across Essex should be consulted on this very important issue because it could have an impact on us all. Some of you may say what is the point of consulting on a Nuclear Power Station at Bradwell in places like Brentwood and Saffron Walden when they are many miles away, but taking that view would be ignoring some of the key issues that need to be addressed with nuclear power.\nSome people are concerned about the vulnerability of Nuclear Power Stations to a terrorist attack. Others are concerned about the difficulty and expense of nuclear waste disposal.\nLocal authorities are now directly responsible for all nuclear emergency planning beyond the stations perimeter fences. Our residents have a right to know that robust and workable emergency plans are in place. A proper consultation would help to answer some of those concerns.\nIf there was a terrorist attack at a Bradwell Nuclear Power Station it could have a catastrophic effect on many of our residents living miles from the site. A new study by Independent Nuclear consultants Large & Associates has revealed that a plume of highly dangerous radiation from an incident at a reactor has the potential of affecting thousands of people in a 36 mile radius in just seven hours.\nSome of you will say it can never happen here but we only have to look around the world at places like Chernobyl to realise that nuclear accidents do happen and when they do they can have a devastating impact on the population for miles around.\nSome people are also concerned about trains travelling through Essex carrying Nuclear waste. In June 2002 there was an accident at Ashford in Kent between a train carrying nuclear flasks and a lorry at a crossing. Fortunately on that occasion the flasks were empty but if they had been full it could have been a major disaster.\nThese issues and many others need to be properly addressed and the best way is through consultation.\nThis consultation should be organised by the Government and should consist of exhibitions and public meetings at key towns across the County along with an advertising campaign promoting the consultation website. This action will ensure that there is much greater awareness of what is happening in the County on Nuclear Power and will ensure that all our residents voices are heard on this very important issue.\nWhatever your views are on nuclear power, I hope that members across the Chamber will give this motion their full support.\nNote: The Conservatives running Essex County Council did not support this motion and it fell.",

A third said that it was very likely they would need to close\nnurseries in their area and that it would mean there was reduced support for disadvantaged children.\nIn our primary and secondary schools there are clear signs of the financial strains they are under. Parents are being asked to pay for school clubs that used to be free\nand in a survey by the charity Parentkind they found that a fifth had been asked to help with the supply of basics such as stationery, glue and in some cases even toilet\nrolls. This is inevitable when even the government acknowledges that its funding increase this year will not cover all of the pay awards it agreed to.\nThere is clearly something wrong when hundreds of headteachers feel the need to march on Downing Street to express their concerns about the levels of funding\nThe Further Education sector is in an even worse state, Amanda Spielman - the government appointed head of Ofsted - writing to the Commons Public Accounts\nCommittee said that 'real term cuts to FES funding are affecting the sustainability and quality of FES provision.'\nHow generous of Philip Hammond then to give schools some extra funding to buy those 'little extras' (IT equipment only, it seems) - so many parents will still be asked to contribute to the basics such as pencils and toilet rolls.

The planned £41 billion project to upgrade Trident (Dreadnought\nprogramme) is also expected to cost £2.2 billion a year to run- for the next 30 years.\nMilitary leaders have called for increase spending, but is it necessary? Fortunately, we have our special relationship with the USA, who according to SIPRI \"spent more on its military than the next seven highest-spending\ncountries combined\" which surely overwhelms any threat to the UK.\nFew countries pose a threat to Mainland Britain; therefore, spending should be focused on security services that prevent terror attacks and for stronger anti-\ncyber-attack systems and not on military investments. Furthermore, joint-state organisations (e.g. Europol) is a way to unite and further protect ourselves,\nsomething Brexit may compromise.\nThe Liberal Democrats commit to defence spending as well as working towards worldwide nuclear disarmament. However, spending on defence can be saved\nby cutting expensive military ceremonial events and; to think that we have recently started pulling troops out of the Rhineland since WW2, where else can\nmoney be saved?\nCurrently the UK has a failing NHS, a major housing crisis and cuts to education and infrastructure which is being overshadowed by billions of tax payer's\nmoney to fund unnecessary expensive technology to 'keep up to date'. This equipment was of course unhelpful for such wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nNevertheless, a sufficient and respectable amount of spending should be allocated to defence to keep UK and her territories protected.\nThis article appeared in the Talking Point section of the Brentwood Gazette in November 2018.",

Unsustainable levels of personal debt, mostly secured against the illusory 'wealth' of rising, vastly inflated property prices. An economy based so heavily on debt was never going to be in a fit state to deal with global shocks like the credit crunch.\nAnd so it has proved. Gordon Brown is now facing the consequences of his years of inaction. The housing bubble has burst. Unemployment is rising fast. Tens of thousands of families are losing their homes.\nWith people struggling with massive debts and fast rising bills it is now almost inevitable that the UK is heading for recession. Gordon Brown used to boast we were better prepared than our competitors for a downturn. Yet the OECD's respected economic forecasters now predict we will fare worst among the world's seven leading economies (G7) in the current crisis.\nWhat Britain needs now, and urgently, is practical action to help people who are struggling - to put money back in their pockets, to cut their energy bills, and help them keep their homes.\nGordon Brown and Labour can't offer that. They got us into this mess. Now they are veering between complacency and anic. Dithering on key decisions, muddling along on half measures.\nDavid Cameron and the Conservatives won't offer it. At a time when those on the breadline are struggling more than for a generation, their top priority is tax cuts for millionaires.\nIt's not good enough to just keep muddling along and hoping.\nWe need a serious plan to get Britain's economy up and running again.\nThat is why Nick Clegg and I have put together the Liberal Democrat Fairer Future Economic Recovery Plan.\nOur plan would:\n- Put more money in people's pockets - tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes,\n- Stop unnecessary home repossessions and provide more affordable housing,\n- Make energy companies reinvest their windfall profits in cutting bills, and\n- Deliver extra help for people in debt or who lose their jobs.\n- And we will bring the free-wheeling, 'anything goes' short-termism of the City to an end. We cannot continue with a culture where bankers pocket big bonuses for taking reckless risks, but when things go wrong government and taxpayers have to step in to pick up the pieces.\nPlease read the plan, and share it with other people you know.\nThere is only one party in Britain today with a serious and credible plan to get Britain's economy back on its feet - and to provide real help to those struggling in the meantime.\nThat is the Liberal Democrats.\nLiberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor\nPS.

Their Plan contained (amongst other things) an excessively high concentration of sites allocated for housing development in Brentwood, Shenfield and Warley. The Lib Dems had, even then, been criticising these proposals for years because of our fundamental concerns about the impact that they would have on infrastructure in these areas - particularly roads, doctors surgeries and schools. And even in November 2018 the Tories knew that the version of the Plan they were voting for was not the version that could be submitted, because numerous pieces of work still needed to be finished (or even started), including the crucial studies which would show if these proposals could actually make sense. So, since it was the Plan they (and they alone) had approved they surely should have continued to pay close attention to the plan's evolution thereafter - in case any of the problems that the Lib Dems had pointed out for years (and they had ignored), should prove as insoluble as we'd always feared, and therefore a new approach would be required.\nHowever the Tories (having always stuck their heads in the sand over the Plan's many problems), simply went back to sleep after it was submitted. Meanwhile Brentwood's officers and consultants continued to work extremely hard on further pieces of work, essential to demonstrate whether the plan was viable and deliverable in the real world. Any responsible administration would (of course) have been involved all along in studying, guiding and informing this work - helping to ensure that it remained acceptable to residents who have to live in the real world, as well as to planners. Something the Tories have completely failed to do.\nOne crucial challenge was somehow demonstrating that all of the town centre development airily agreed by the Tories wouldn't have immense and unresolvable negative effects on Brentwood as a town and a borough. In the version which has been submitted to the planning Inspectors, and discussed at the Local Plan Hearings in December 2020 and February/March 2021, a central claim was that town centre development wouldn't cause the insoluble road and junction problems that the Plan's own Transport Assessment apparently showed it did. This argument is partly based on the notion that town centre development is inherently sustainable - particularly that new residents of town centre developments wouldn't travel principally by car (as most Brentwood residents do), but would walk, use public transport, cycle, belong to car clubs etc, etc. All of which are good things, and Brentwood's Lib Dems would dearly love to see that kind of future (not least because it also desperately needs to happen in order for climate change to be averted) - but unless its realistic right now then we can't and won't support a plan which simply pretends this will happen; the plan has to be believable in the real world.\nBut sustainable transport in the town centre also needs to involve those travelling there to work, shop, eat and visit leisure facilities. The claim that this will happen focusses on a 'Park, Ride and Stride' scheme which has never been publicly discussed and assessed. And that scheme proposes Park, Ride and Stride hubs in three locations: the Brentwood Centre; land to the east of Wash Road, Hutton; and King George's Park. This information is publicly available on the council's own website as Appendices A and B of the latest iteration of the plan's Transport Assessment (document F65), and has been since January this year. One might have thought that the council's Conservative administration would be aware of what its own plan is proposing (indeed that - if it was doing its job, at all - it would have been closely involved in working out what these fundamentally important proposals would be). But neither of these things is true. At Ordinary Council on 10 March 2021, two months after these documents were published by the council of which they are supposed to be the administration, neither Cllr Hossack, Brentwood Council's Tory Leader, nor Cllr Poppy, whose Community Health and Housing committee has responsibility for King George's Park and the Brentwood Centre, were aware of these proposals. Cllr Hossack said \"It's news to me Park and Ride from King Georges is proposed. There's not an immediate plan for it\". Cllr Poppy said that he'd never seen any mention of Park and Ride at King George's.\nSince Brentwood's Tories clearly can't be bothered to do the job of running the council and managing the Local Plan - probably the council's biggest single piece of work - maybe it would be better to vote Lib Dem at the elections on May the 6th. We'll put the work in - and, as our knowledge of the council's proposed Park Ride and Stride schemes shows, we already are putting the work in, unlike your yawning Tories.\nCllr Philip Mynott has been ward councillor for Brentwood North since 2010 and is deputy leader of Brentwood Liberal Democrats.

The Conservative majority on a scrutinycommittee on Wednesday 11 March agreed to not oppose the cuts, after they were approved by Essex County Council's Cabinet.\nThe Liberal Democrat Opposition group had tabled an official \"Call In\" notice after the Cabinet meeting and Lib Dem Councillors Theresa Higgins, David Kendall and Jude Deakin made the casefor not proceeding with the cuts.\nThe cuts include deleting at least 25 full time youth worker posts, people who play a vital mentoring and support role for young people in Essex.\nThe Liberal Democrats mounted a scathing attack on the plans. They said:\n1. There was no discussion before the Cabinet decision of how the new service will work.\n2. The county council expects the voluntary sector to step in to run services they are cutting,but there are huge concerns about whether enough volunteers will come forward to be properly trained.\n3. The county council expects the youth service to raise £800,000 a year income or else face further cuts, but little evidence has been given of how this will happen.\n4. The youth services will not be monitored properly in future.\n5. The local Youth Strategy Groups (one for each of the 12 Essex Districts) do not have enough funding or decision making powers.\n6. Community leaders are just having the problem dumped on them to sort out.\nThe county's Lib Dems have made standing up for young people the centrepiece of their attack on various Conservative decisions recently. In their budget amendment on 11 February they identified surplus cash that could have been used to protect youth services and keep bus passesfor college students, but these rescue plans were rejected outright by the Conservatives.\nCllr David Kendall said:\n\"Many residents cannot understand how Essex County Council is willing to spend £19 million on interim staff over the last two years but can only find £3.4million to fund the Youth Service budget for the whole of Essex. The Tories have got ther spending priorities all wrong. Essex County Counci is cutting funding to its Youth Service when other counties such as Hertfordshire and Suffolk are investing more it just doesn't make sense. The result of these cuts will see Essex losing experienced youth service professionals when we need them out there in our communities more than ever. The Tories should hang their heads in shame\"",

Due to her medical circumstances, she was already registered for a transfer to another property better suited to her particular needs. Co-incidentally a suitable property became available whilst she was in temporary accommodation, so she moved straight into her new property.\n\"Whilst the property at Harewood Road is vacant we are arranging a full clean out of the loft space before it is let to a new tenant.\"",

That difference is the Liberal Democrats.\"\n\"He reminded the conference that not one Liberal Democrat flipped their home during the expenses scandal or benefited from capital gains tax.

For David Cameron, change stops on May 7th. It's change for him, not change for you. We are different.\nI want to warn you about something that is coming in the next few weeks.

Labour will say: vote Lib Dem... get Cameron.\nDon't believe it for a second.

Some people are thinking of holding their noses and voting for Brown just to keep out the Conservatives. I say to you: don't do it.\nSome people are thinking of holding their noses and voting for Cameron just to get rid of Labour. Don't do it.

Would you smile at the prospect of five more years of Gordon Brown? Would you be thrilled if a Conservative government was now in charge?\nIf the answer is no, then don't give them your vote. If you vote for less… you will get less. If you compromise on them… they will compromise on you. Just good enough - is not good enough any more.\nWhen you think about who to vote for remember that the future of your country is at stake. Whatever you do… do not settle for the way things are.\nBe demanding.\nVote for what you believe in.\nVote with your heart.\nIf you once voted Labour but have lost hope.

It is crucial that dependence on oil and other fossil fuels should be reduced if high quality services in the medium and long term are going to continue to be delivered. Local government financial settlements are likely to be very tight over the next few years and cutting energy spending is one way to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Local authorities, as major employers, need to demonstrate leadership at this critical time.\n\"Brentwood Borough Council, therefore, pledges to join the 10:10 Campaign - which seeks to deliver 10% cuts in carbon dioxide during 2010.\n\"If this Council can deliver a 10% cut in our emissions in 2010, we can show we are part of the solution, reap the rewards of low carbon government and set an example to other businesses and organisations\".\nThis motion was tabled by Cllr David Kendall, seconded by Cllr Karen Chilvers and referred to the Policy Board for consideration.\nPlanning Notifications\n\"Brentwood Borough Council will urgently review the procedures in place for notifying residents of planning applications that affect them to ensure that the notices are effective, timely and take account of:\n- The potential effect that a planning application will have on properties in the vicinity that surround the property, not just those either side and across the street.\n- The differing nature of properties, for instance, that a planning application in a semi-detached property may affect the occupants two doors away more than the one next door.\n- Multi-dwelling buildings, where each individual dwelling should be notified\".\nThis motion was tabled by Cllr Karen Chilvers, kindly seconded by Conservative Cllr William Lloyd at the invitation of Cllr Chilvers and referred to the Planning & Development Control Committee for consideration.\nThe webcast can be viewed at www.brentwood.gov.uk.",

We had to bear the brunt of ridicule and jibes simply because, as young men, we decided to wear our hair long and our jeans tight. We were the forerunners of today's very successful music and fashion industries, but it came at a cost, and I do not want to see that type of bigotry revisiting upon another generation.\nCllr Chris Hossack's ridiculous and irresponsible views on the young women that come to Brentwood to experience the 'TOWIE town' have done nothing to support our visitors, merely subjected them to pulpit bashing prejudicial remarks.\nI personally believe one of the most beautiful things on earth is a woman and the girls growing up in my generation introduced many forms of fashion. They had backless tops, mini-skirts, tight ribbed jumpers, hipster jeans and hot pants and were resplendent and happy within themselves when wearing them.\nCllr Hossack's remarks denigrate young women to refer to them as 'putting it out there' and a 'meat market' and do not belong in a modern society. I was hoping that there would be a retraction by Cllr. Hossack and an apology made, both generally and to the young men and women involved in the TOWIE programme, who have done a lot to bring trade into Brentwood, but that doesn't appear to have happened.\nIn fact, I hear today that Deputy Leader Cllr Roger Hirst and his fellow colleagues in his Conservative party are backing everything he said.\nA sad day for us all.\nCllr Barry Aspinell\nLeader, Brentwood Liberal Democrat Group",

It is hard to put into words the values and characteristics which shaped Charles, but his strength, commitment, his consistency and his good humour all come to mind. His commitment to Brentwood, and his ward, Pilgrims Hatch never wavered. Charles represented as an extremely hard working, much respected councillor for 20 years. He was very proud of Brentwood and played a decisive role in shaping and protecting our town.\nCharles served the Borough of Brentwood with distinction as our mayor of Brentwood between 1996 and 1997, he saw this as a great honour and was ably supported by his wife Pauline. Charles' interests were not limited to local government - he served as a governor at Chelmsford FE college for many years, and with Pauline was an active member of Shenfield Garden Society. Charles believed in supporting his community and borough with actions as well as words, and strongly believed in an active civic society and Brentwood's many voluntary organisations.\nTo his friends and colleagues in Brentwood Liberal Democrats, he was strong, true, a free thinker, and a loyal friend. Charles' unwavering support saw many Liberal councillors successfully elected to Brentwood Council, and this continued long after he stepped down from the Council.\nCharles leaves a strong legacy of hard work and dedication to Brentwood and to Pilgrims Hatch.

You could not get a better councillor for serving the people and the borough of Brentwood.\nCllr David Kendall, Pilgrims Hatch councillor\nI know that many residents will be shocked and saddened to hear the news that Charles Myers has passed away. He was an excellent Borough councillor for Pilgrims Hatch over many years and was well liked and respected in the community.

He was a great listener, always willing to offer advice but never one to force his thoughts on you. He was encouraging, reliable and consistent. He knew the party inside out and I will never forget turning up on his and Pauline's doorstep for advice shortly after becoming party Chairman in a time of need. His willingness to help and support me truly meant a great deal. He was tremendously loyal, thoughtful and a passionate advocate of Liberal politics.

In the UK, possession and dealing in controlled drugs is regulated by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. In broad terms, possession of controlled drugs amounts to a criminal offence which potentially carries a prison sentence. It necessarily follows that this legislation drives the consumption of controlled drugs underground.\nThe actual use of controlled drugs is a completely unregulated process. There are no quality controls, no hygiene checks, no guidelines as to consumption\nand no leaflets identifying side effects. There have been numerous reported cases of contaminated drugs causing serious illnesses including hepatitis and HIV or even death. This can apply to the oral use of drugs but is a particular problem associated with intravenous use. These consequences are all very avoidable no matter how entrenched the addiction. The criminalisation of controlled drugs is a massive subject of debate in itself - but not one I propose to address in this article.\nRather, I am concerned as a human being for the devastating effects of unregulated drug use upon the end user when things go wrong. Wherever your opinion lies upon the issue of the criminalisation of drug possession, the truth of the matter is that as things stand, anyone who wants to get hold of controlled drugs can do so.\nSo, I personally advocate the setting up of safe houses where the consumption of controlled drugs can be overseen and regulated.\nOverdosing would be eliminated as would the appearance of contaminated drugs in the supply chain. There would be a cost - but I believe there would be a corresponding saving far in excess of the cost in terms of savings on NHS care.",

This is wrong and short sighted.\nI have seen recently the tremendous work done by the community working together to save Shenfield library. It does appear that this facility has been given a lifeline with a properly planned and resourced library service included in the redesign for the site. Promises have been made and we know that the local community will hold local politicians to account over those promises. But it should never have come to this position whereby the community were forced to come together and fight to retain a statutory service.\nLibraries are important. They are cornerstones of a healthy community. Libraries give people the opportunity to find jobs, explore medical research, experience new ideas, get lost in wonderful stories, while at the same time providing a sense of place for gathering. Libraries contribute to the health of individuals and the community by providing a welcoming environment where people can learn in their own time and on their own terms. Libraries are a unique and valuable resource.\nThe Liberal Democrats wholeheartedly support the UK library and information associations 'My Library By Right campaign.' Libraries are a statutory service and recognising this is an important step in ensuring that they are available to everyone.\nOf course, like everything, libraries must evolve. The internet does much of the heavy lifting for doing research. I have seen my local library, Shenfield, at times transformed as it runs sessions for children and parents amongst other things. Libraries elsewhere have successfully introduced places to buy coffee and snacks. Others have formal meeting areas for hire. The days of entering the library and being immediately 'ssssshed' for making the slightest sound are probably gone, no bad thing either. The modern library is a more dynamic space, but all provide that silent space for reading and contemplation.\nRecently we have seen numerous libraries being, managed and staffed by volunteers. I tip my hat to all those community minded people who keep libraries alive by volunteering. As stated above libraries are unique and a statutory service. A council wouldn't dream of transferring any other statutory service over to volunteers. Whilst I'm sure that a Conservative think tank somewhere has discussed it, imagine the outrage if Social Care, Planning or nvironmental Health was run on a volunteer basis? Whilst researching the topic of volunteer libraries I was struck by local authorities who follow this route and advertise for volunteers to come forward, make it front and centre about what good such volunteers will be doing for their communities, highlighting the importance of the service that has seen its funding cut. It's almost as if the library services should be properly resourced.\nYour local Liberal Democrats will fight to ensure all library services remain in place and available to the communities they serve.\nGary MacDonnell is Chair of Brentwood Liberal Democrats and our candidate for the 2021 Borough Council election for Shenfield Ward.

Sadly some people might be taken in by the nonsense they are peddling on the doorstep and in their blogs so here are the facts:\nWe WOULD have a referendum on the EURO\nWe believe that it is in Britain's long term interest to be part of the Euro. But Britain should only join when the economic conditions are right, and in the present economic situation they are not. Britain should join the euro only if that decision was supported by the people of Britain in a referendum.\nWe are NOT going to abolish all prison sentences under six months\nWe know (and experience shows) that tough community punishments are more likely to stop people from committing more crime than a few weeks in a prison cell watching TV and learning the tricks of the trade. We will not stop courts from sending people to prison if they felt the circumstances demanded a short prison term. And people who breach their community punishments could also be sent to prison. Our plan is to in most cases avoid sentences of six months or less.\nWe are NOT committed to abandoning Britain's Nuclear Deterrent\nWe do not support unilateral disarmament. We do think it is wrong to spend £100 billion replicating a nuclear weapon system designed to win the cold war against the Soviet Union. We believe this isn't the best way to defend us against modern threats. Senior military figures like Field Marshall Lord Bramall agree there are better cheaper alternatives. These should all be considered as part of a Strategic Defence Review.\nWe will NOT give an amnesty to all illegal immigrants\nImmigration in this country is in a complete mess. Tory and Labour governments weakened border controls, abandoning real control.\nOur solution to deal with the illegal immigrants they let in is to concentrate deportations on foreign criminals and people traffickers. We will only give illegal immigrants who have been here ten years, speak English and have not broken the law the opportunity to go legitimate, benefiting the tax man.\nThe Labour party have already bought in regulations that give illegal immigrants an amnesty after 14 years. It is dishonest of Labour and the Conservatives to suggest that you can simply round up perhaps three quarters of a million people that they let in and deport them all. It would not only take years, cost nearly £10 billion and probably wreck the economy if they could actually find them. The Tories are hopelessly split on the issue.\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson has suggested an immigration amnesty in London to try and tackle the problem, but David Cameron doesn't want to know.\nLabour and the Conservatives choose to simply ignore the problem and hope it goes away. In the meantime many of these people are being exploited by criminal gangs when they could be contributing to our society by paying tax and national insurance like everyone else.",

A recent report showed that rural crime has hit a seven-year high, costing the UK £50m in 2018 and up 12% on the previous year.\nThese figures only confirm what people in rural areas have known and been reporting for a long time. As government gets ever more centralised our rural areas are increasingly left behind. Successive policing ministers seen to have forgotten that the countryside is our most vulnerable area. A visible presence from police in rural communities now must be a priority as a proven way of reducing crime.\nThere are different models but 'bobbies on the beat,' visible policing is a preventative and proactive role that can be focused on emergency response as they will be the closest people to the incident. Similarly, police are central to communities, closely cooperating with other public services to keep communities safe.\nThe National Rural Crime Network produced a number of recommendations including reviewing the funding formula used so that the costs of policing in rural areas is recognised; finding ways of encouraging rural communities to report incidents to the police; the police and partners needing to work better together to tackle rural crime; policing to be better targeted in rural areas to take account of vulnerable victims; improve knowledge and embed best practice of tackling crimes in rural areas; and that prevention and response policies are needed that focus on improving protection for rural businesses.\nThe Conservatives have taken 5,000 police off the beat since 2015, with rural areas bearing much of the brunt of this. The Liberal Democrats call for our Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner and the government to fully reverse the cuts to our police and ensure our rural areas are supported in the fight against crime.\nGary MacDonnell is Chair of Brentwood Liberal Democrats and our candidate for the 2021 Borough Council election for Shenfield Ward.

In 2010 the youth service budget was reduced from £12 million to £5million and the Tories now propose to identify a further £3 million of savings, reducing the spending on these services to £2 million (an overall reduction in spend over the last three years of £10 million or 83%)\nI accept that in these tough economic times some savings have to be made but to savagely cut a budget by 83% that is there to support young people across Essex is in my view nothing short of a disgrace and the Tories locally and at County should hang their heads in shame.\nWhen the last cuts were made in 2010 many good professional youth staff were lost for good and the Connexions Youth service went completely, leaving many young people without the guidance and support they so badly needed. These latest proposals will cut staffing levels down to skeleton cover and will rely heavily on local volunteers to fill the gaps. Whilst we should always encourage people to volunteer on youth and other projects many of these people are going to need the back up, support and encouragement of the professional youth workers on the ground if they are going to last the course and have a hope of delivering what is required.\nThe Tory master plan is to devolve power down to the local Youth Strategy Groups like the one we have in Brentwood. In theory this sounds like an interesting idea but in practice I see major problems ahead because devolved power isn't much good if you don't have the money and the people resources on the ground to deliver the services that our young people so badly need. If that wasn't bad enough In their rush to save money the Tories have conveniently forgotten to address some very serious issues such as Who is going to provide professional safeguarding for young people? Who is going to provide provide professional Health and sexual advice to young people? What is going to happen to the Duke of Edinburgh award Scheme in Brentwood? My request for answers on those points have to date been met with a wall of silence.\nIf you want to take part in the consultation you can visit the website.",

The proposed budget will be discussed by councillors at the Finance & Resources committee on Tuesday 4 February, before going to Ordinary Council the following week.\nThe proposals set out how the Council intends to manage the increasing cost of delivering vital services, and be prepared for any external financial pressures, whilst still being able to invest, maintain and develop services over the coming year and beyond. Overall the proposal is for a balanced budget. The budget proposal, along with the Council Tax proposal for 2025/26 and Fees and Charges will be taken to Ordinary Council on Thursday 13 February for agreement.\nTo maintain and invest in vital services, the proposal is to increase the Brentwood Borough Council element of Council Tax by 2.99% for 2025/26. This would equate to a charge of a Band D property increasing by 11.77 pence per week or £6.12 per annum for Brentwood Borough Council services. This increase is largely in line with Borough and District Council’s across Essex. Rents will increase by 2.7% which equates to an increase of £3.03 per week. The rent money will be used to reinvest back into the housing stock and deliver the repairs programme.\nThe budget has £750k of investment items for 2025/26 which include:\n- £135,000 on staffing investment to our CCTV coverage.\n- £68,000 to help deliver economic development priorities\n- £100,000 in locality grants for local groups and organisations\n- £68,000 to increase capacity in our planning team\n- £50,000 to help relieve the burden on healthcare services\n- £85,000 on street cleansing initiatives, including increased bin collection\nCllr David Kendall, Chair of the Finance & Resources Committee at Brentwood Borough Council said: “Financially the Council is in a good position, where we are looking to set a balanced budget, invest in key areas and freeze car parking charges in council owned car parks. Whilst this is a good position to be in, it doesn’t happen by accident – it is what the Joint Administration has planned and prepared for since we took control of the Council.\n“We have followed the historic precedent on Council Tax changes that mean a typical band D property will see an increase of just 12p per week, whilst making sure we maintain and enhance our services to residents.”\nThe Council is also making large capital investments in the Brentwood Centre, key Community sites and our Play Areas across the Borough.\nCouncillor Kendall added: “Whilst there is some uncertainty around what local government reorganisation will mean in the future, we will continue to listen to residents on their priorities and what they want local services to deliver now and for the future.\n“Two years ago I inherited a deficit budget as Finance Chair, I am proud to have now reversed that risky course and proposed two budgets that invest in Brentwood, while balancing the books in these tough economic times.”\nFollowing debate at the Finance & Resources Committee on Tuesday 4 February, the proposed budget will go to Ordinary Council on Thursday 13 February.",

However this claim is hard to take seriously when you actually consider the facts. Two examples that immediately spring to mind are the future of the Town Hall where we have been working cross party with others to try and find a viable solution going forward and the parking review where following Cllr Clarke's input and advice we fully supported the Tory recommendations, many of which originated from the Lib Dems. These examples more than prove the point that where we have agreed with the Tory administration we have been prepared to support what they were doing and have certainly not always opposed for opposition's sake.\nWhat the Lib Dem group has always taken very seriously is the responsibility of being the only credible opposition in Brentwood to the Conservatives. Time after time we have held the administration to account and constructively challenged them if we believed what they were doing was wrong for the Borough. In contrast the sole Labour representative has often sat on his hands and said nothing on a whole range of issues including the recent failure by the Tories to get the accounts signed off on time. I appreciate that the stance taken by the Lib Dem group may not have always been to Cllr Clarke's liking and I respect his position, but he should always remember it was the Lib Dems who stuck with him on getting the multi storey car park re-opened on a Sunday and it was the Lib Dems who pushed hard for the Lighting Up Event to go back to a Saturday when many of his new Tory colleagues didn't want to know.\nIn his resignation letter Nigel also says that his beliefs and values are now best represented by the Conservatives. Knowing him as I do I find that statement very hard to believe but now he has made his decision I hope for his sake that the Conservative party locally and nationally meets all his expectations.\nContrary to what Eric Pickles and other Tories have said, I believe Cllr Clarke's departure has left the Liberal Democrat group in a stronger position.

Everyone earning over £19,000 will be hit.\n\"The new 45p Income Tax rate is nothing more than a fig leaf to cover a £5bn tax hike which will hit millions of low earners and businesses.\n\"The Government has missed a golden opportunity to make the tax system permanently fairer which it could have done by cutting income taxes for those on low and middle incomes, paid for by getting rid of tax loopholes for the wealthy.\n\"Instead of increasing investment in sustainable capital projects which benefit the country tomorrow as well as today, the Government has opted for a temporary cut in VAT which will benefit big spenders the most and not give the economy the boost it needs.\n\"At a time of economic emergency, Gordon Brown has once again failed those who need help the most.\"\nFull text of Vince Cable's response to the statement in the House of Commons\n\"Perhaps I may start with some of the positive points with which we can agree: the statement on repossessions, the action on small business lending, the programme on home improvement, and the postponement of the decision on retrospective vehicle excise duty.\n\"This is not a normal pre-Budget statement. We are experiencing a national economic emergency, and what is required, alongside radical cuts in interest rates and radical action on bank lending, is a serious tax cut concentrating on the low paid. The Chancellor has based his plans essentially on a temporary small cut in value added tax. I note that he is relying on the advice of a former Conservative Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), in that regard.\n\"What I fail to see is how the economy receives a major stimulus from, for example, a £5 cut in the price of a £220 imported flat-screen television or a 50p cut in a £25 restaurant bill. Surely it would be much more sensible to put money directly in the pockets of low-paid workers by cutting their income tax, rather than offering them a pathetic £25 and, if they earn over £20,000 a year, the prospect of tax increases.\n\"The Government have at last, after 11 years, acknowledged that there is a problem of inequality relating to the tax system. What they propose is a higher rate of tax for very high earners, after two years-possibly. What is needed, surely, is a comprehensive approach which involves cutting income tax for low-paid middle-income families and removing the vast plethora of tax reliefs and allowances from which the wealthy benefit, rather than this very limited fig leaf for redistributive policy.\n\"What I find wholly incredible about the statement are the assumptions that the Government make about the future trajectory of the economy. They simply assume that after one bad recession year there will be an economic recovery. Buried in the Red Book is the assumption that after next year, the public sector need make no contribution whatever to economic growth. However, the problem is a very deep one. This is not just a conventional recession. We do not just have the home-grown problem of the bursting housing bubble and personal debt; we have the imported credit crunch.\n\"As far as the banks are concerned, the problem is very deep. The Prime Minister tours the world, a little bit like a celebrity heart surgeon, lecturing the uninitiated on how to carry out financial heart transplants, but meanwhile the patient back here is suffering very badly, because the banks are cutting credit and greatly increasing their margins. I welcome what the Chancellor said about the Royal Bank of Scotland's announcement yesterday; that was a positive step. I do not, however, know whether he is aware that today Barclays, whose balance sheet is twice as big as the Government's entire public debt, is in the process of negotiating a deal with Arab investors on such extortionate terms that it is bound to make a drastic reduction in bank lending at the expense of its British customers. It is all very well for the Government to say that they are setting up a panel to monitor bank credit, but what is the Chancellor doing to enforce the conditions that the banks have apparently agreed to?\n\"I welcome some of the Government's comments on public investment, particularly on housing, but let us just consider the status of the Government's commitment on housing, with their £700 million programme of social housing. The Government have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Land is available very cheaply in the current market, and they could make a programme of large-scale social housing construction, meeting housing need and providing employment in the construction industry, but despite the rhetoric and the promises, virtually nothing is currently happening. It is not happening because the housing associations are loaded with bad debt that they acquired in dodgy deals with developers, and the Treasury is blocking any fundamental reform in the housing subsidy system. Nothing is happening.\n\"To conclude, we have a very serious national economic crisis. The Conservatives do not acknowledge it, so they do not propose to do anything. The Government have rhetoric, but the rhetoric is not matched by their actions.\"",

So, more parking capacity would not really help - the roads to get there are full. Also, land in the centre of towns is in short supply and very expensive. So, more car parking there is unlikely.\nHowever, we could provide more parking on the edges of the urban areas and provide Park & Ride buses into the central areas. The site at Sandon, to the east of Chelmsford, has proved very successful and other areas might benefit from similar services.\nIf buses are high quality, fairly priced, on time and reliable, people will be more willing to use them. They don't just reduce congestion caused by cars, but they also reduce air pollution, especially if they are new, low-emission buses.\nChelmsford also needs its long-promised new railway station at Boreham, and Brentwood looks forward to the (delayed) arrival of Crossrail.\nEvery urban area in Essex needs an area-wide approach to new cycle paths and secure cycle parking.

In so doing we garnered the support, and the votes, of prominent figures both to the left and the right of the political spectrum such as Alastair Campbell and Michael Hestletine.\nIt was surely also this that helped us crush the Tories in Theresa May's constituency (31% vs 13% of the vote), whilst simultaneously beating Labour into second place in Jeremy Corbyn's constituency.\nUnlike either the Tories or Labour, we're also a truly national party - with local authority victories from the south coast of England to the Orkneys (also gaining a spectacular 77% of the vote in Gibraltar - where they really understand the potential costs of leaving Europe).\nThese results are also fascinating in terms of the evidence they provide about the respective strengths of Remain and Leave support both locally and nationally. Combining the respective support for unequivocally Remain parties across the country, including the nationalists, shows a 40.4% share of the vote, whereas the unequivocally Leave parties gained only 34.9%. Maybe simply because of the devastating results for the Tories, and the excessive coverage he receives, one might be forgiven for thinking that Nigel Farage's latest ego-vehicle (the old one having been discarded), picked up strong support in the south eastern corner of England. In fact, however, adding up the votes cast across the East of England region, the South East region and London shows that, even without taking Change UK into account, almost two and a half million were cast for the Lib Dems and Greens combined (2,448,697), whilst the Brexit Party and UKIP managed only just over two million between them (2,078,318).\nWith consistent, moderate, progressive policies the Lib Dems show that there really is way forward in tempestuous political times. In the future, with the support of even greater numbers, so much more can still be achieved. It's time to step forward, and make a real difference.\nCllr Philip Mynott is deputy leader of the council group and has been councillor for Brentwood North since 2010.",

A coroner is being asked to rule that air pollution caused the death from an acute asthma attack. This finding would make legal history. It has never been identified as a cause of death before in the UK and this is thought to be the first case of its kind in the world. Representatives from Lewisham Council, the Mayor of London and government will give evidence about their knowledge of the levels of toxic air around where Ella lived, the health impacts and what was being done to reduce the pollution. It has already been decided that article 2 - the right to life - of the Human Rights Act, that scrutinises the role of public bodies in a person's death, apply to the hearing.\nWhat is beyond dispute is that air quality levels were poor and spiked to Illegal levels in and aroundthe time of Ella's death. That is levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) exceeding legal limits. The public health team at Lewisham Council also accept that exposure to these levels of Nitrogen Dioxide can affect public health.\nWe await the outcome but should air pollution be identified as a cause then all councils will be on a high state of alert and I believe we will start to see authorities properly start tackling the matter of air pollution. Standing by will no longer be a viable option for those with the power to make necessary changes.\nCurrently, all borough and district authorities have responsibility for air quality. To be clear, in Brentwood it is the role of the borough council, not the county council, to ensure that air quality is not in breech of public health guidelines. I take the position that all local authorities do take this responsibility seriously but as has been stated at Ella's inquest authorities move at a \"glacial pace\" in response to these matters. Ella's inquest could change this, local authorities and public health officials could in the future be legally responsible for our health with legal implications should they not fulfil these roles properly and act to control air pollution.\nWithin Essex we have started to see some interventions happening to improve air quality. Those that travel regularly on the A127 will know that 50 miles per hour speed restrictions were introduced in 2019 through the Basildon area. This required a ministerial directive from central government to improve\nair quality on certain lengths of the A127. The implementation of a 50mph enforced restriction can deliver a reduction in the NO2 levels in order that they will comply with the Air Quality Directive by 2021.\nLike all areas of the country, Brentwood has its issues. Brentwood suffers negatively in terms of air quality due to its proximity to major congested roads like the M25, A12 and A127. There are localised hotspots, again in common with all areas these seem to cluster around schools at drop off and pick up times, urban centres, supermarkets and - most ironically - health centres. Brentwood has had three declared Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs). These are declared when there is an exceedance or likely exceedance of an air quality objective. After declaration, the authority must prepare an Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) within 12-18 months setting out measures it intends to put in place in pursuit of compliance with the objectives. 12 to 18 months is to my mind, far to long to tackle such a serious issue. The three AQMA's were:\n- AQMA 2: Parts of Brook Street, Brentwood and the A12\n- AQMA 4: Parts of Warescot Road, Hurstwood Avenue and Ongar Road, Brentwood and the A12\n- AQMA 7: Parts of Ongar Road, Ingrave Road, High Street and Shenfield Road, Brentwood in proximity to Wilsons Corner (the junction of the A128 and A1023).\nTo note that the Brentwood Borough Council 2020 Air Quality Annual Status Report proposed revoking these AQMAs with higher levels of air quality being measured which is clearly a positive step. However, I was struck by how little actual proactive work was considered for the reduced levels of pollution. Instead the case for revoking seemed to rest on weather conditions affecting readings and the proposed extension of the London Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) from Central London out to the North Circular boundary. It was noted that this \"is likely to drive an improvement of the vehicle fleet emissions on routes in to and out of London, through Brentwood either along the A12 or around the M25 which could lead to further downward trend of concentrations in AQMA2 and AQMA4\". (A copy of Brentwood Borough Council's 2020 Air Quality Annual Status Report (ASR) can be accessed here).\nBrentwood Liberal Democrats have a very clear position. We must now start to make local changes to improve air quality. This isn't a question of reaching legal minimums, it is about ensuring heathy streets. The Healthy Streets Approach is a system of policies and strategies to deliver a healthier, more inclusive urban area where people choose to walk, cycle and use public transport. We will work to put in place infrastructure that will encourage cycling, walkable neighbourhoods and safer school streets. We will encourage more active travel, improving physical health and wellbeing, reducing congestion and pollution. The Liberal Democrats will be proactive on air quality.\nGary MacDonnell is Chair of Brentwood Liberal Democrats and our candidate for the 2021 Borough Council election for Shenfield Ward.

  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_cllr-david-kendall-s-budget-response/content_1313.html": "Cllr David Kendall's budget response\nAs the Leader has already said we are living in very difficult financial times. This budget is having to be set against a background of massive national debt which is affecting us all. I am sure the Labour member will seek to blame all this Council's woes on the policies of the Coalition government but even he cannot ignore the fact that this country has been left with a record deficit from Labour's 13 years in power and the country is now borrowing £400 million every day.\n\"Last week many of my Liberal Democrat colleagues from around the country signed a letter to the Times about the cuts and Eric Pickles handling of his local government department. I fully support what it was saying and I, along with many other Lib Dem Leaders, have now added my signature. The Liberal Democrat group that I lead strongly believe the reduction of central government grant should be spread over four years and believe the \"front loading\" of these cuts is the wrong way of doing things.\n\"Eric Pickles may be the MP for this area but he and his department have certainly not done us any favours with the 16.8% reduction in formula grant which is making Brentwood's the worst settlement in Essex and one of the worst settlements in the country.\n\"As the Leader says we have a budget gap of £2.26 million, not only that we have £274k shortfall in fees and charges, and our parking revenues are down.\n\"As the Leader knows we had major concerns regarding the way the budget consultation was conducted. We would have liked every house in the Borough to have received a consultation leaflet and we believe the leaflet itself should have clearly shown the money currently spent on services to enable residents to make a much more informed decision.\n\"As we have already stated we have a number of concerns about this budget. The rent increase has given Brentwood the unwelcome tag of having the highest rent increase in Essex. We are genuinely concerned about the 36% of our tenants who are not on any form of housing benefit as in our view these increases will hit them very hard.\n\"We are concerned about the level of borrowing that is already being put down on the Town Hall. The figure of £3m over three years is already higher than the projected shortfall we were given in the papers at the Town Hall meeting last week and over the months and years ahead I predict it will rise even higher.\n\"The Town Hall project has been sold by the administration as a way of cutting running costs. However we are very concerned about the cost of servicing the Town Hall debt. With our reserves standing at £2.75m after the VAT windfall the question has to be asked why aren't we using some of that money to fund the Town Hall changes.\n\"I am disappointed our proposed increase in fees and charges wasn't even debated because by having an overall pro rata increase of 2% instead of 1% it would have meant another £45k of projected revenue for the Council. This extra revenue would have enabled us to give Thames Chase £9.5k and the local CAB £10k towards the cost of another debt advisor. We could have also given financial support to the summer out of hours service and ensured more parking enforcement in the evenings and at weekends.\n\"If ever our retailers and businesses in the Town Centre needed a boost it is a now. We predict the closure of the William Hunter Way car park will have a major impact on our retailers. Whilst the park & ride proposals might help, we need to do all we can to make visiting the town through all the construction work as an attractive proposition as possible. Our proposals on parking which were costed by the finance officers would have seen the cost of parking for the first hour reduced by half and meant that the parking burden was shared more fairly between the daytime and the night time economy. Sadly they were turned down.\n\"Our proposals to streamline the Councils panels and commitees by merging the Policy & Business & Economic Panels would have not only saved this Council £10k and speeded up the decision making process but with the Leader as Chair it would have sent a clear signal to the business community that their welfare was a major priority.\n\"This budget leaves a lot of question marks about shared services. It seems likely we are going to share our waste collection services with Basildon and Castle Point. What next??\n\"To sum up we welcome the 0% increase in Council tax and fully support the reductions in members allowances however we cannot support this budget for the many reasons I have outlined.\"",

Yet if such potential fall-offs happened the immeasurably greater danger would be the death of the High Street, something which should have concerned the council all along.\n\"Thirdly, the utter absurdity of discounting Brentwood Centre and King George's car parks as possible park-and-ride sites because of the huge, finally admitted, problem of A128 (Ongar/Ingrave Road) congestion, when the scheme itself, if built, would enormously add to already dire congestion on this and other Brentwood routes.\nIf not commenced within three years, planning approval for this development will have to be renewed in February 2012, but, with Europe's largest shopping centre having just opened at Stratford, the Liberal Democrat group say it is time for a proper rethink and some new creative ideas which could actually benefit Brentwood and set us apart from other towns.",

As I drive around Shenfield I constantly see accidents waiting to happen with irresponsible and dangerous parking by, I can only assume, commuters who have found a space not enforced to leave their vehicles all day.\nWorking with our County Councillor, Barry Aspinell, we have presented to County Highways and the South Essex Parking Partnership a demand for prevention and enforcement in this area. A scheme is being drawn up for double yellow lines from the traffic lights to Shenfield School and hopefully this will not take too long to have painted on the road.\nSPEEDING\nMany residents have contacted both Barry and myself to complain about the speed of vehicles in the Chelmsford Road. Essex Police will not consider any\nnew speed cameras so we have asked for a speed survey for this road on many occasions and unfortunately the speeds recorded do not warrant, we are told,\nintervention by the Police.\nWe, like you, are concerned by this response and will be pursuing the Police, yet again, asking for speed watch events to take place. This involves volunteers, trained by the Police with a speed watch camera that will record speeds and number plates and the offending vehicle owners will receive a letter from the Police and if there are repeat offenders they will be fined.\nWe have also received requests from concerned parents trying to cross the Chelmsford and Shenfield roads safely. Barry has requested County Highways for a Pelican Crossing in the Shenfield Road around the Nuffield Hospital area. Eighteen months ago County Highways turned down a request for a Pelican Crossing by Shenfield School and the Rose vicinity.\nLOCAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN\nIn the latest round of the Local Development Plan, our Conservative-run council has highlighted sites in Shenfield for over 1,000 new homes. Eight hundred of these are planned for the Chelmsford Road. Whilst we would agree there is an opportunity here for a reasonable amount of new dwellings we believe that 800 is\nover the top, plus we would lose our beautiful green field entrance from the A12 into Shenfield, transforming it into an urban strip. The Liberal Democrats have always stated they would negotiate with developers for a reasonable amount of housing in this area as long as there was a sufficient amount of community gain for existing and new residents.\nThis would include preserving the land behind the houses in Chelmsford Road almost from Mountnessing roundabout to Hall Lane as a Country Park, in addition to providing much needed additional health centres and road safety measures,\nPlease feel free to contact us with any queries on the above,",

One minute they are telling us what a great job Brentwood Borough Council is doing providing local services. Next minute they are announcing that the Borough Council is going into a joint partnership with Essex County Council to provide a one stop shop for local services. They follow this up with the news that we are going to have one Chief Executive running both authorities, who just happens to be the County's Chief Executive.\nWhat is wrong with that, some of you maybe asking, particularly if the changes provide residents with better services? The Liberal Democrats have fought hard for local residents to have better services, but we want Brentwood Borough Council to keep it's own identity and continue operating as a separate entity from the County Council. We also want the Borough to have it's own Chief Executive whose time is totally focused on meeting the needs of Brentwood residents.\nYou would have thought that with such a major change on the agenda the Conservative administration would have first consulted with opposition members and strategic partners to discuss any concerns they might have well before any announcement was made.\nSadly this hasn't happened. The only consultation with opposition members on their proposals was an urgently arranged meeting of the Appointments Panel on the same day the news was launched to the press. Sadly I couldn't attend the meeting due to work commitments and gave my apologies, but it seems my views and concerns would have counted for little as the deal had already done behind closed doors. So much for Tory Leader David Cameron's vision of open government.\nIn Brentwood we have got used to the Conservative administration railroading through their agenda as quickly as possible in an effort to suppress genuine debate. However this latest announcement shows political arrogance of the worst kind. This major change has been signed off as a done deal and announced to the press two weeks before any members of the Council have had a proper opportunity to discuss it at a special council meeting on September 11th.\nThe Liberal Democrats have now called for a referendum to give local people the opportunity to decide on who runs Brentwood going forward, if the Conservatives are so sure this is a great deal for Brentwood then they should support our call for a referendum and let the people decide.\nYours sincerely\nCllr David Kendall\nLeader - Liberal Democrat Group - Brentwood Borough Council",

Being able to recruit staff from 27 other countries was of considerable benefit to us. So, rather than immigrants \"coming over here stealing our jobs\" and \"putting a drain on the NHS\", it has become apparent that they were staffing it and, through their taxes, helping to fund it.\nThe Lib Dems have been tirelessly making the positive case for immigration and the significant contribution a diverse workforce makes to the economy. In a recent statement, the Scottish Lib Dems noted that each EU citizen working in Scotland contributes over £10,000 in taxes and £34,000 in GDP, this replicated all over Great Britain.\nIf you know a Spanish doctor, an Irish nurse or an Italian waiter prepare to say goodbye.

There have also been detailed reports of regular drug misuse in another area of Hatch. I was contacted by the residents who asked me to act on their behalf. I forwarded, as their ward councillor, the comprehensive list of the times the young people were congregating to the police.\nThe response was rather shocking as I was informed my evidence didn't count!! As you might imagine I wasn't happy about this and a complaint went to the new Chief inspector Ant Alcock.\nChief inspector Alcock rang me and gave an undertaking that he would treat seriously the problems reported and apologised for the past lack of response. However he did emphasise the importance of residents calling the police each time an incident occurs as to get action that will be supported by the courts there must be several complainants. He also encouraged the use of Crime stoppers as an anonymous route of reporting where a resident may not wish to identify themselves on the 101 number or web site.I appreciated his advice and have informed residents in the areas of concern. Whatever route we need to go the people profiting by selling drugs must and will be stopped!",

The rating given does not even meet the minimum requirements and is at the same level as Haringey Council.

The GP surgery has refused to engage with us, even when a request was made by NHS England, and with NHS England and the Health Ombudsman unable to help we feel that it is our duty and responsibility to raise this matter at the highest level and trust in your department to take the appropriate steps to investigate. Our aim is to make the surgery aware of the issues and help them to resolve them and that is why we are sad they will not engage.\nAlthough problems with this surgery, specifically the ability to get to see a doctor, have been the subject of hearsay for four years, it was during the May 2018 local elections that we began to realise the extent of the problem as dozens of residents in the wards of Brentwood West and Warley, within the catchment area for the surgery, confided in us when we knocked on their doors, asking us to help.\nWe promised we would, and we will make their voices heard. Subsequently, we asked for them to send us evidence and they did, again in high numbers.\nThe appointment system at Beechwood is failing and letting patients down. The current state of play is that:\n- Waits for appointments are currently at seven weeks,\n- No bookable appointments are available on their patient website,\n- Appointments not offered before 9am,\n- No emergency appointments are offered or priority appointments made available for those with complex or long-term health problems.\nOn the last point, this is particularly unacceptable. Patients with long term health conditions need to be able to see their doctor in a timely fashion. Those with conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and heart problems cope well, as a rule, but when things become more acute, it's not always urgent enough to require a trip to A&E but nor is it appropriate for them to wait for nearly two months or be required to ring up every day to plead for an appointment. After all, these conditions often must be managed in conjunction with work and/or family commitments. Our fear is that this will lead to more severe complications for them.\nWhat is enormously disappointing is that the surgery blames patients for the long waits for appointments, saying they didn't cancel them. Of course, the flaw in this argument is that the missed appointments have not yet been missed, it is something yet to occur and not the reason for a seven-week wait. Further, as far as we are aware, the surgery does not keep records of those that couldn't be accommodated and reacts with shock and incredulity when they are told that patients can't get appointments within a reasonable time frame.\nResidents also reported, and two of us have first hand experience of this, that the practice is routinely sending patients to A&E or the Polyclinic in Harold Wood (4 miles away and half a mile from the bus stop/train station) with no regard for how they get there, or they are instructed to attend A&E at Basildon University Hospital (10 miles away) or Queen's Hospital in Romford (7 miles away) for complaints such as ear infections. Serious yes, but easily sorted with a simple prescription and maybe not the right reason to clog up already overstretched emergency services. Patients have told us that they sometimes wait until 6.30pm and get a prescription from the efficient 111 service. Those with funds to do so have taken to paying for private GPs.\nThere are many consequences of the failings of a GP appointment system and, here, we simply report what we have been told by Brentwood West and Warley residents who are patients at Beechwood:\n- A patient waiting a month for an urgent podiatry referral for a diabetic foot ulcer,\n- Crucial appointments for consultant-ordered treatments, to be undertaken in primary care cancelled on the day,\n- A patient being left for nine hours in need of a prescription for painkillers as indicated by a paramedic, also refusing to speak to the paramedic,\n- A patient arriving ten minutes early for an appointment, waiting 15 minutes to check in and then being sent away for being late,\n- A patient being told he could not book an appointment at the desk and being sent outside to call in, only for the one appointment available to have been taken by the time his call was answered,\n- A patient eventually stopping their treatment due to non-availability of appointments, at detriment to their health,\n- Patients with high temperatures, long term conditions and recent seizures being refused an appointment.\n- Prescription requests, referral requests and notes from patients and consultants being lost,\nWe were further concerned to note that in the NHS England Patient Survey 2018 data released in August that the surgery is ranked 6567 out of 7109 surgeries in England - in the bottom 10% in England alone.\nThat same survey shows us that this is not a 'Brentwood problem' but a problem specific to this surgery:\n- At Beechwood surgery only 26% of respondents describe their experience of making an appointment as good. The local (CCG) average is 62% and the national average is 69%.\n- Only 35% of Beechwood respondents find it easy to get through by phone. The local (CCG) average is 66% and the national average is 70%,\n- At Beechwood, only 30% of respondents are satisfied with the general practice appointment times available. The local (CCG) average is 69% and the national average is 66%.\nAs those who represent the patients of Beechwood Surgery we have a responsibility to highlight this in order that the surgery can be helped to improve and offer the service that patients should expect and we now feel the best way to do this is to leave it in your hands to filter down to the appropriate body as we are thwarted at every turn locally.\nYours sincerely\nCllr Karen Chilvers\nBrentwood West Ward\nCllr Nigel Clarke\nWarley Ward\nCllr Mark Haigh\nWarley Ward\nCllr David Kendall\nBrentwood South County Division\nCllr Dominic Naylor\nBrentwood West Ward",

Official examples of ASB, to name a few are: Littering or drugs paraphernalia; trespassing; street drinking; vhicle nuisance or inappropriate use; rowdy or inconsiderate behaviour.\nSo, is there an ASB problem in Brentwood? Local residents only have to think a little while back to the World Cup, where drunken supporters rolled out onto the high street stopping traffic and causing criminal damage to vehicles and the venues that hosted the games.\nFurthermore, according to the official crime stats, between June 2017 and July 2018 there were 1,548 reported ASB incidents around Brentwood. Examples of these are reckless drivers on quadbikes and groups of people intimidating people in the high street.\nOne cause of ASB is boredom among youths- group of friends running out of things to do and getting up to no good. A way to tackle this is by encouraging the community. A safer, happier and active community would prevent ASB. Funding youth/community clubs gives young people something to do other than roam the streets and from my former nights at a youth club, I know this works. Community policing would get an extra £300 million a year under the Liberal Democrats to create a safer environment and means more officers on the streets with the locals to prevent crime happening.\nIn Brentwood, not enough is being done, especially after the years of severe cuts to the polices and Essex youth services. An engagement between local schools and the community could improve the lifestyle of residents as well as teaching young people how to be respectable members of the borough.",

David has a strong record of action and service to the local community having served as a Brentwood Borough Councillor for over 32 years. If he's elected as the areas MP he will use that knowledge and experience to get a good deal for Brentwood & Ongar\nThe recent local election results across the Brentwood & Ongar constituency clearly show the Liberal Democrats offer the only serious alternative to the Conservatives in this area. The Labour party may be riding high in the polls but they have already written off this constituency by publicly stating it's not a \"battle ground\" seat for them.\nResponding to Rishi Sunak calling a General Election, David Kendall said:\n\"For years our area has been taken for granted by an out-of-touch Conservative Government that has failed to get the basics right and has lurched from crisis to crisis - now it's time for change.\n\"Local health services are struggling to keep up with demand, peoples mortgages and rent have skyrocketed and water companies have been allowed to pump their filthy sewage into our rivers and beaches. All this by a Conservative government more interested in fighting between themselves than standing up for the country.\n\"Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for a fair deal, it's a vote for a party that will stand up for the residents of Brentwood & Ongar and make your voices heard. Please give me your support on July 4th\"",

She said:\n\"With the council about to enter into an agreement to jointly run the country parks we need to remind the administration that users really do not want the nature of the parks to change and the charm and beauty are important. A new management arrangement must ensure that it is properly funded and that the temptation of entering into commercial arrangements to balance the books is avoided.\n\"We need to be very clear that the local stakeholders must include the hundreds of people who campaigned against the commercialisation of their park.

Fast forward to the here and now and this utopia has still to happen!\nThings have changed since I was a youngster, with working age people choosing vastly different paths for their careers, especially in a digital age where echnology moves ahead at breath-taking pace.\nThat said, I firmly believe that us 'oldies' have acquired a multitude of skills and knowledge during our lifetimes and by simply reaching a particular age it doesn't mean that there is no longer a place for those qualities. Indeed, some individuals choose to continue in their jobs beyond retirement age and this is good for our\neconomy, but also for that individual's wellbeing.\nBeyond retirement for some represents a perfect opportunity to take on a part-time role where their skills and expertise can be called on. Take, for example, B&Q, where it's frequently a retired tradesman who is able to guide a novice through the process in achieving specific home improvements, a specialist nurse who is able to contribute her skills through a charitable organisation for those needing palliative care, or a teacher who can use her knowledge as an exam invigilator. The list is endless.\nSo how can we make the best use of all these skills? I think we already are,especially as the decision whether to continue working after retirement is very much\na personal one.\nHowever, if you think your skills could be used at the Town Hall, why not become a Councillor?",

You can see that article HERE.\nI'm sure that everyone in Brentwood and Essex will be aware of the battles fought by library campaigners across the County when the Conservatives threatened the Library service back in 2018/19. In Shenfield the story has, in some respects, moved on significantly. There is a planning application, welcomed in theory, lodged for the redevelopment of the Shenfield Library site to include a library service. Where we haven't moved on from is the long-term future of a library service in Shenfield. Whilst there is shown a library in the plans there is nothing in writing stating that there will be a library service in Shenfield after the new building opens from 2024 onwards.\nThere are also some very specific issues with the designs themselves. Firstly, there is no parking for blue badge holders. Yes folks you did read that correctly, a local authority in 2021 has allowed a planning application to be lodged for a public service building that is essentially inaccessible for people with disabilities. Whilst forward thinking organisations are designing to be fully accessible looking at putting infrastructure in to support the rapid switch to electric vehicles amongst other such necessary interventions, Shenfield library can't even offer a parking space for a disabled person. Think about that for a moment. That is against every public service ethos. If the public sector can't design its own buildings and services to be accessible, then we really have no chance of getting equality in our society.\nSecondly very reasonable concerns around equipment needed to maximise the use of space seem to have been ignored. Space to store chairs as a most obvious example. Will keeping chairs off site encourage maximum use of the space? Of course, it won't. There is significant investment happening and that investment is welcome, but it is beholden on anyone spending taxpayers' money that all efforts are made to ensure maximum value for money is achieved. Getting the very best for the space and taking full advantage of the facility use is the way to maximise that value for money criteria. I have nothing but the utmost respect for those individuals that come together and formed groups like the Shenfield Library Users Group to fight for the services they believe in, the services they have paid for through taxes. But it really should not be like this. Fighting a battle like this is draining, it is tiring and it's all so unnecessary. It is shameful that greater clarity has not been provided three years after this all first came to light.\nBrentwood Liberal Democrats call on Conservatives in Brentwood and Essex to come out and guarantee a long term future for a properly managed and accessible library service, staffed by professional librarians that has all the facilities that the community needs to make maximum use of the building. Secondly, we call on the Conservative administrations to properly consult and work with the Shenfield Library Users Group to define those requirements and work with them to find solutions that will maximise the use of the building. It is by maximising the opportunities for use that true value for money will come from this investment.\nBrentwood Liberal Democrats will fight to save all libraries in the borough.\nHave your say.

There are multiple examples of these, including Brentwood Station Car Park (R10 in the Plan), Westbury Road Car Park (R11), Chatham Way Car Park (R13) and William Hunter Way Car Park (R14). Nonetheless the questions became so unanswerable, from the Council's point of view, that all examination of this aspect of Local Plan Matter 7c was halted, with the only site specifically touched on having been the Station Car Park. A decision was then made to defer all further discussion until the Council had hurriedly worked up a new document explaining its position, with the coverage of these sites postponed until 2pm on Thursday February 25th.\nThis in itself is not so very unusual: the examination of any Matter may go on for longer than predicted, and throw up unexpected questions and facts, which is why there are always several sessions set aside at the end of the scheduled process for outstanding matters. However a number of aspects are of profound concern in this case.\nFirstly the questions surrounding levels of town centre car parking and their proposed redevelopment for housing are hardly new or unexpected. Brentwood's Lib Dems have been continually asking such questions throughout the evolution of the Local Plan, and doing so because the numbers have very visibly never stacked up, or reflected the realities of Brentwood's problems.\nIn terms of housing numbers, Lib Dems have raised concerns for years, throughout the Local Plan process, at the levels of Town Centre development proposed; levels finally approved (by the Conservatives only), in November 2018. On the Matter 7c sites alone (numbers in each case quoted as being \"around\") 125 housing units were allocated for Nags Head Lane, 100 for the Station Car Park, 45 for Westbury Road, 31 for Chatham Way, 300 for William Hunter Way, 48 for Hunter House, and 80 for Wates Way; in total, 729. But, that isn't all: there are also \"around\" 200 units allocated to Doddinghurst Road, 38 on the Sow and Grow Nursery in Pilgrims Hatch, 43 off Warley Hill, 473 on or near the Ford HQ in Warley, 45 in Priests Lane, 35 on the Blood Bank site in Crescent Road (although 86 have been approved), and 825 north of Shenfield in Officers Meadow and surrounding land. In November 2018 there were 2687 houses and flats proposed for the Brentwood Urban Area (which includes the Shenfield, Warley and Pilgrims Hatch sites)! The traffic from all of which would inevitably, at some stage, have to use the same handful of junctions on, and between, the A1023 (Brentwood High Street/Shenfield Road/ Chelmsford Road), the A128 (Ongar/Ingrave Road), the B186 (Warley Hill/ Queens Road), the B185 (Kings Road) and the A129 (Hutton/ Rayleigh Road). None of which junctions consist of anything more sophisticated than a mini roundabout, and none of which have room for, or agreed/ financed plans for, junction improvements!\nBut secondly, whilst overdevelopment approved by local Tories should obviously be of enormous concern in itself (as regards the threat of gridlock on the roads, air quality plummeting and the local economy and businesses expiring - as anyone who can avoid the town centre proceeds to do so), there is still another side to this mess, and that is Town Centre car parking. As the Inspectors themselves point out in their Matters Issues and Questions (MIQs) \"evidence submitted suggests that those [Town Centre car park] sites controlled by the Council (R11, R13 and R14) provide nearly 600 spaces which constitutes 45% of publicly available parking in the town centre.\" Because of this the Council has so far undertaken to maintain levels of existing Town Centre public car parking across the council owned sites, without ever committing to exactly what the final distribution of these maintained numbers of parking spaces would be. And again it is Brentwood's Lib Dems who have held officers to account, repeatedly asking for confirmations that this was the policy, and that this vital commitment would continue.\nMoreover, and thirdly, there is the little matter of the Council's Car Parking Strategy, which has been talked about seemingly for years, and about which discussions are still rumbling on. Again it is Brentwood Lib Dems who have held the Council to account, and pointed out that it would always have made sense for this document to be discussed, prepared and consulted on in tandem with the Local Plan process. Instead of which, thanks to Tory mismanagement, the Council's poor officers are now having to try to persuade Planning Inspectors (at what is supposed to be the end of a grinding eight year Local Plan process), that proposals to redevelop town centre car parks for housing make sense, even though no Car Parking Strategy exists.\nNevertheless, at least up until about 10.50 on the morning of Thursday 4th, the Council did still plan to maintain town centre public car park numbers. Except what happened on Thursday was that, faced by the realities of the Inspectors' questions as to the feasibility of the council's commitment to maintaining numbers of spaces whilst simultaneously proposing so much housing on these sites, the Council's policy resolve began to crumble, and the policy could be seen being altered on the hoof, after a half hour break in the hearing. Again the council must have prepared answers to this in advance - the Inspectors' MIQs ask \"If the [town centre] sites are no longer required for parking, why do the policies require proposals to 'consider wider Town Centre parking needs …….. in order to ensure that the current level of Town Centre public parking spaces is maintained'?\" Furthermore the Inspectors enquire \"How is this achievable?\"\nAnd yet it turned out on Thursday that the Council apparently couldn't answer how this was achievable. Paul Shadarevian, QC, speaking for the Council, said, \"the policies as originally worded did seek to maintain the same level [of parking] through collaboration with other development sites in the Town Centre… In so far as modifications have been proposed recently to those policies I think they should be set aside because we cannot be confident that the existing public parking provision on those sites can be maintained.\" He then proposed that the Council \"prepare a paper which identifies the potential ability of the allocations to maintain a level of public parking\", but admitted, \"What I can't do at the moment is to identify what the outcome of that process will be, other than to indicate that there is likely to be a net loss.\"\nWithout pre-empting the outcome of the Council's (hasty) further work on this, the position of Brentwood's Lib Dems is that this is entirely the wrong approach. If maintaining the existing levels of public parking in the Town Centre proves, when examined, not to be deliverable whilst the Plan's current proposals to develop car park sites for housing remain in place, then\nThe council should have been able to identify this basic flaw in the Local Plan, during the years of work on it that have already taken place.\nThis is a huge failure, but not of the Council's officers, (who have worked long and hard, but also long been under-resourced by the Conservative administration). It is, plain and simple, a failure of Brentwood's Conservative administration to pay attention, not merely to the basic realities of life in Brentwood, but to years of Lib Dem comments pointing out exactly these deficiencies in the Plan, all of which were originally offered in a non party-political effort to arrive at a Plan which did make sense.\nThe correct solution to the problem of an undeliverable combination of too many proposed new housing units and maintaining the present amount of parking spaces is very simple. Reduce the numbers of new housing units proposed in the Plan, and maintain existing levels of public car parking!\nAnd the reason why is simple too. Unless this is done, a Plan that already threatens to wreak destruction on the borough's economic, retail and commercial heart, and to drastically worsen the living standards of thousands of existing borough residents is just about to be made more damaging still.\nBrentwood's Lib Dems will continue to fight against this unnecessary and irresponsible destruction.

As a solicitor, he has honed his family and criminal law expertise, a testament to his commitment to justice and community welfare.\nA lifelong football enthusiast, Councillor Haigh plays walking football for Ingatestone. By his admission, he has never been much good at it but has always been an enthusiastic participant. He also has a passion for football, squash, walking and snooker.\nSince 2018, he has represented the Warley Ward as a Councillor and was recently re-elected earlier this month. He was the first Liberal Democrat elected mayor since Councillor Vicky Davies in 2014/2015. It is also the first time two councillors from the same ward have shared Brentwood’s civic duties.\nFollowing his appointment, Councillor Haigh said: “I am hugely honoured to be able to represent Brentwood as Mayor, and I am very happy to give myself to the borough I love. This community has been my home for many years, and I am committed to making a positive impact during my term.\nHe added: “Brentwood’s close proximity to London, its transportation infrastructure by road and rail and its beautiful parks and landscapes makes it a very special place to live. I look forward to working with my fellow Councillors and our residents to continue building a vibrant and inclusive Brentwood.”\nFor his Mayoral fundraising initiatives, Councillor Haigh has chosen two local charities that have a profound impact on the Brentwood community: the Trussell Trust Food Bank, which has been a lifeline for many residents, and SNAP (Special Needs And Parents), a beacon of support for families with children who have specific needs and disabilities.\nCouncillor Haigh added: “As my charities, I have chosen two organisations that offer something special to Brentwood. Brentwood Trussell Trust Food Bank, led by Bonnie and her dedicated team, has provided vital support for the past 13 years. Their selfless dedication is truly inspiring, and supporting them was an easy decision.\n“SNAP, founded 30 years ago by eight Brentwood mums, has been a beacon of support for families with children who have specific needs and disabilities. Their hub next to Beechwood Surgery in Warley is a testament to their extraordinary work, offering a comprehensive calendar of services that benefit both children and parents.”\nBrentwood North Councillor Alison Fulcher will support Councillor Haigh in his term of office as the Mayor’s Consort.\nCouncillor Jay Laplain is joining Councillor Mark Haigh as Brentwood’s First Citizen and Deputy Mayor. With his wealth of experience and dedication to public service, not least as Deputy Leader last year, Councillor Laplain is also poised to contribute significantly to the community. The duo will be the first Liberal Democrats to hold both offices since the late Councillor Alan Davies did so with Councillor Shirley Howe in 2002-3.\nCouncillor Laplain has lived in Brentwood for 17 years, moving here with his wife to be closer to the BT office, where he has worked for BT for 25 years. He is a grandfather to six granddaughters. He has been a councillor for Warley since 2019, sitting on various committees and became Deputy Leader of Brentwood Borough Council in 2023.",

The move means councillors can now submit claims without senior members checking them first, claim mileage without any receipts and pay for hospitality on the premise that it makes the council look good.\nCouncillors altered three sections of the Members Allowances Scheme in a meeting on October 11, 2011 - less than a month after former council chief Lord Hanningfield finished a jail term for expenses fraud at the House of Lords. Rules now say councillors can provide hospitality to third parties under 'exceptional circumstances', such as 'buying lunch for the purpose of managing the reputation of the council'.\nMr Aspinell, who refuses to claim expenses, said the new rule was far too vague because any lunch bought for a third party could be considered to reflect well on the council. \"Councillors shouldn't be claiming for lunches at all,\" fellow councillor Theresa Higgins said. The pair also criticised changes to travel expense rules, allowing VAT-registered councillors to claim mileage without submitting any receipts.\nMr Aspinell said: \"It's a nonsense.

Following the vote won by opposition councillors in Augst, officers have, rather than being instructed to fulfill the decision as is usual, been instructed to gather more data to see if it works financially. At best, this means the change can't be brought in until April 2014.\nShenfield councillor and deputy leader Cllr Graeme Clark said:\n\"It was a mixed result, I am delighted to get the half hour charge in Shenfield agreed but cannot understand why the Tories wish to delay the re-introduction of the one hour charge in Brentwood.\"",
  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_tories-threaten-our-high-streets/content_318.html": "Tories Threaten Our High Streets\nAfter some electoral reversals last year, the Tory government put on hold multiple controversial changes to the planning system that they had, until then, been proposing. During the Chesham and Amersham by-election campaign, for instance, the Lib Dems were helped to victory by being able to quote ex-Prime Minister Theresa May's criticisms of Johnson's proposed planning changes against the Tories themselves! Unfortunately, this still didn't mean that Britain's planning system was spared from Tory interference.\nTo put it technically, on May the 30th last year the Government surreptitiously created a new Use Class (Use Class MA), in the country's planning system, which would become live on August the 1st 2021. This change didn't just suddenly allow the conversion of retail units (including High Street shops) to residential uses, which would normally (and for very good reasons), have been difficult to do before. It actually chose to put these conversions into the category of Permitted Development, where an applicant only has to notify the council that they are making this change, and councils then have extremely limited powers to do anything to stop it.\nThat means a Local Authority can't apply its chosen development plan polices in these cases - for instance policies like those meant to protect employment, to maintain the quality of new housing or to deliver desperately needed affordable housing! Like the (currently postponed) wider changes to the system, this undermines local planning control; it ignores the root cause of the current housing shortage, and it circumvents the rules on providing the kind of affordable housing which the country is so short of. Which was why this step was strongly criticised by numerous non-political national organisations: the Royal Town Planning Institute, the Town and Country Planning Association, the National Trust and even the British Property Federation, amongst others, are opposed to it.\nAs if to make things worse this has been introduced when British businesses are under unprecedented pressure (nationally one in seven Class E units - the kind which the new rule allows to be converted - are already empty), thanks to Covid. This change is likely to wreak havoc with the viability of UK high streets, and, if it does will to do so irreversibly - once High Streets have lost enough shops, they will never be able to recover, they will be High Streets in name only. A report from University College London last year was already predicting losses of High Street businesses ranging between 89% and 75%, with four out of five shops vulnerable, most of which will be small and locally owned.\nBecause of our alarm at the damage this national Tory policy could do, the Lib Dems put forward a motion on this subject which was debated at the Ordinary Council meeting on December the 8th last year. Our proposal was that the council should contact the Government officially, urging it to \"listen to the expert advice of numerous Planning organisations, to protect the future of the UK High Street, and to scrap this ill-advised policy.\"\nIn fact, the council could do more than this - it could go through what is known as an Article 4 process, which would allow it to choose areas within the borough where this national policy would not apply. Any application to convert a shop to flats within the chosen areas would simply go through the normal planning process as before and be decided on its merits - in other words, it would be refused if, for instance, it harmed the local economy and introduced residential properties in completely inappropriate places (as it would be very likely to). Councils which have retained sufficient resources to be able to go through the necessary steps (and of course care enough to protect their local High Streets), can therefore head off the threat. At least one council had agreed to do so before the end of July last year (in other words preventing the change from ever affecting parts of their boroughs). But, after being hollowed out by more than a decade of Tory rule, Brentwood council neither has the resources to spring to the defence of its own High Streets like this, nor (clearly) cares enough to do so. And even though the Lib Dem motion simply proposed standing up for local High Streets by literally sending a message to the Government that \"This council wants its High Streets to thrive and not die,\" not one single Tory councillor was prepared to vote in favour of it; one Tory abstained, the remainder blindly voted the motion down.\nVoted the motion down, and, of course, have since taken no other step to prevent the destruction of local shops that will be caused by this policy from their national colleagues.\nBrentwood deserves better than the Tories - Brentwood deserves councillors who will fight for your local area as Lib Dems do, not stand idly by whilst our borough suffers further from national Conservative stupidity, as Brentwood Conservatives repeatedly do.\"",

The international community must at last agree to a single plan in place of the present patchwork of duplication, disunity and muddle.\nThe threadbare legitimacy of the government in Kabul must be strengthened by reaching out across ethnic and tribal divisions. And here at home Gordon Brown must change gear, too. He must now show the leadership and conviction that has so far been so disastrously lacking in making the case to the British people.\nYou cannot win a war on half horse power. We owe it to the young men and women serving in Helmand to give them all the political leadership and all the resources they need to do the job. We should either do this properly or we shouldn't do it at all. So I say to the Prime Minister: time is running out.\nUnless you change course, there will be no choice but to withdraw, and that would be a betrayal of the servicemen and women who have already made such enormous sacrifices on our behalf. I do not want British troops to come home defeated by political failure. I want them to come home, mission successfully completed, with their heads held high.\nToday is the beginning of real change in Britain\nLet me tell you why I want to be Prime Minister. It's because I want to change our country for good.\nBecause I want to live in a country where prejudice, insularity and fear are conquered by the great British traditions of tolerance, pluralism and justice. Where political life is not a Westminster village freak show, but open, accessible and helpful in people's everyday lives. Where fine words on the environment are translated into real action.\nWhere every child can grow up safe and secure, able to flourish, no matter their background, their income, or the colour of their skin. Where we make sense of the complex, globalised world of our times and play a creative role in shaping it.\nWhere rights, freedom and privacy are not the playthings of the government but safeguarded for everyone. I want to be Prime Minister because I want to be the first Prime Minister in my lifetime to be on the side of the weak against the powerful, on the side of freedom against conformity, on the side of human innovation against government decree.\nI want to be Prime Minister because I have spent half a lifetime imagining a better society. And I want to spend the next half making it happen.\nI was lucky enough to be brought up in a large, warm family that had almost no time at all for the status quo. By parents who encouraged us, required us, as children always to ask why. Always to assume that there is a better way of doing things. If you only bother to look for it. That's the spirit I found in the Liberal Democrats. It's why I joined, and why I wanted to lead our party.\nFriends, this has been quite a week for us. I've been called a number of names. Even \"a good leader\". By Evan Harris. I am never going to duck asking the important questions, however difficult they are. But I am immensely proud to lead a party that actually debates things, openly and democratically. Let's always remember: we are in this together.\nSo let us not look back any longer. Let us look forward. From this point on, keep your eyes on our goal. Let today mark the beginning of real change in Britain.\nThese are extraordinary times. A global recession. Mass unemployment. A broken political system. Government finances in crisis. And still: inequality rising and climate change spinning out of control. Faced with these extraordinary challenges; We need an extraordinary government.\nBlue-Red, Red-Blue\nBecause one thing, above all others, is certain. The way we got here is not the way out. The blue-red, red-blue politics that got us into this mess cannot clear it up. The way we got here is not the way out. Britain needs a change of direction. Let today mark the beginning of real change in Britain.\nLook at what the old red-blue politics offers. Back in 1997, Peter Mandelson told us to judge Labour after 10 years in government. It's been twelve years. And we have made our judgement.\nIf you're poor, you're still far less likely to go to university than if you're better off.\nIf you're from an ethnic minority, you're more likely to be stopped by the police, even when you haven't done anything wrong.\nIf you're a woman, you'll probably be paid less than the men you know. And if you're a child born in the poorest neighbourhood of my city, Sheffield, you will probably die 14 years before a child born the same day, just up the road, in a more affluent part of town. We have made our judgement of Labour. They betrayed the best hopes of a generation.\nPeople are hungry for change. So the question now is: what change? David Cameron talks about change. But is it real change?\nHe talks about broken Britain but campaigns for tax breaks for the very rich. He says he cares about the environment but then teams up with climate change deniers in Europe. He claims he wants to clean up politics but won't tell you whether his biggest donor pays taxes in Britain. That isn't real change, it's fake change. And Britain deserves better.\nTo be fair, the Conservatives do have one belief. That it's their turn to govern. They think power should come easily. You get the sense from so many of them that they became Conservatives mostly because it looked like the simplest route to a job in the cabinet.\nI chose the Liberal Democrats. Not because I thought it would be an easy route to power. I knew it would be hard. But because I wanted to fight for what I believed in, however hard, however long it took.\nThe Conservatives want to inherit power; I want us to earn it.\nThe thing about David Cameron is - the PR might be good, but what's behind it? It's like my grandmother would have said. There's less to him than meets the eye.\nAs for me? Well, occasionally I'm a bit too blunt in interviews - but at least you know I'm not just spinning you a line. I speak out.\nOn the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nOn Afghanistan.\nOn bankers' bonuses.\nOn citizenship rights for the Gurkhas.\nAnd I am so honoured that some of you have been able to be here with us today.\nPeople are turning to the Liberal Democrats. Because they see there's something different about us. It's our pioneering spirit.\nIt was a liberal, Gladstone, who helped develop the concept of universal human rights. It was a liberal, Lloyd George, who introduced the world's first universal state pension. It was a liberal, Beveridge, who invented the NHS.\nOurs is the party of Paddy Ashdown, the first person to put climate change on the national agenda. Ours is the party of Charles Kennedy. Of Ming Campbell. Who used all the courage of their convictions to oppose the illegal invasion of Iraq. Ours is the party of Vince Cable, the first to see problems brewing in our economy, the first with a vision of how to take us to recovery.\nIt's because Liberal Democrats are different that, when Gordon Brown let casino investment banking loose on our economy. The Conservatives said yes, and only Liberal Democrats said no.\nWhen Gordon Brown let house prices rocket and personal borrowing get out of control, the Conservatives said yes, and only Liberal Democrats said no. When the contracts were being drawn up for new polluting runways. When our civil liberties were being torn up. When our troops were massing on the borders of Iraq. The Conservatives cheered from the sidelines, and only Liberal Democrats said no.\nWe are the only party that offers real change at the next election. Labour is dying on its feet. We are replacing them as the dominant force of progressive politics. We are the alternative to a hollow Conservative party that offers just an illusion of change.\nMake no mistake. There is only one party that will bring real change to Britain. The Liberal Democrats.\nThe Challenge\nThe biggest challenge for the next government will be sorting out the public finances. It's a challenge neither exhausted Labour nor fake Conservatives are fit to take on. This year's deficit is likely to be one of the highest in Europe. We will borrow £175bn this year alone - £5,550 every single second. Total national debt could hit £1.2 trillion next year - £20,000 for every man, woman and child.\nI'll be straight with you. There is no easy solution. There isn't a serious economist in the world who agrees with the Conservatives that, right in the grip of recession, with two and a half million unemployed, we should pull the rug out from under the economy with immediate spending cuts. But, once the economy recovers, we are going to have to control spending tightly for many years to come.\nWe were right, in years gone by, to campaign for new spending to help people, to support them, as children, as young adults, as parents and as pensioners. As Charles Kennedy rightly says: our commitments demonstrate generosity of spirit. And those manifestos were right for an age of plenty. Now something different is needed.\nBut let me make something very clear. I am not going to abandon our vision for a better Britain because money's tight. It makes me more determined. Balancing the government books isn't a maths test.\nFiscal discipline is not an end in itself. We offer discipline for a purpose. Not just austerity, but progressive austerity. Reducing the deficit, yes, but also building a fair society and a green economy. Still driven by generosity of spirit, but fit for the circumstances of the day. It's the only way to deliver real change in Britain.\nThat's why our approach is completely different from the two other parties'. We aren't going to salami-slice budgets like Labour and the Conservatives. Pretending that you can save billions of pounds just by using fewer paperclips and putting up the price of Parliamentary salads.\nIt isn't true, and everyone knows it isn't true. We know what happens when you simply squeeze budgets, across the board, until the pips squeak. We know, because we lived through it before, under the Conservatives. We remember the tumble-down classrooms, the pensioners dying on hospital trolleys, the council houses falling into total disrepair. We remember, and we say: never again.\nLiberal Democrats will do things differently. Not shaving a bit off everything, but asking fundamental questions about what the government should and shouldn't be doing. Working out, openly and publicly, what works and what doesn't. So we can completely cancel the things that don't work. In order to protect, and even in some cases extend, investment that really matters. That is progressive austerity.\nWe've already identified big areas where substantial long-term savings can be made. Reducing the bureaucracy of Labour's centralised state, databases and agencies. Cutting the cost of politics - changing our electoral system and having 150 fewer MPs. Reforming tax credits so they go to the people who really need them. Spending less on defence procurement.\nWe heard yesterday Gordon Brown is considering taking one of the Trident nuclear submarines out of service. I welcome that step in the right direction. But if you want to lead nuclear disarmament around the world, you need to be more decisive. That is why we say no to the like-for-like replacement of Trident.\nSome people have asked me why we've talked so much about identifying cuts. I know it doesn't feel comfortable some of the time. But we're doing it because we know that the more we save, the safer our schools and hospitals will be. And we know that if we save enough, we will still be able to include in our manifesto, despite these difficult times, some of the pledges for new investment that we hold so dear.\nBecause if we end the child trust fund, we can pay for smaller classes for five, six and seven year olds. If we stop the waste of money on the useless NHS IT system. We could improve maternity services so every new family gets a great start.\nIf we substantially reform politics, with fewer MPs, government ministers, departments and quangos, we could save billions. And we could put the money into insulating homes and improving public transport, creating thousands of new, green jobs. Building up Britain's infrastructure not our bureaucracy.\nMany of these decisions will be difficult. Taking them is the price of fairness. But if we are brave enough to take them. It will be the beginning of real change in Britain.\nI want to say something to teachers, doctors, nurses, police officers, social workers, in fact to everyone who works in our public services. Britain depends on people like you and the services you provide. I know these are anxious times for you.\nEveryone is talking about cuts. But neither Labour nor the Conservatives has come clean about what that means for you. They're not treating you like grown-ups. I want to work with you, hand in glove, to agree the way forward on pensions and on pay.\nOn pensions. Of course, we will guarantee every penny of entitlements you've already built up. But we do need to have a proper, independent review of what's fair, not just for public sector workers, but also for the taxpayers who pay your salaries. Let me reassure you: my particular focus will always be on the gold-plated pensions enjoyed by senior civil servants, quangocrats, judges - and MPs. At a time of pressure for everyone, it's only right for those with the broadest shoulders to take the greatest weight.\nNext: pay. We will never go back on an existing pay deal. That would be a betrayal. But in future, we need to work together to agree strict, disciplined limits. Again, I believe people with the most generous salaries should take the brunt of cuts so their lower-paid colleagues don't have to. But if it comes down to discipline on pay or mass redundancies. I think we all agree: protecting jobs must come first.\nYoung people are bearing too much of the burden of this recession. Imagine how it must feel to have slogged your way through school, college or university, maybe racking up thousands of pounds in debt, only to find there isn't a job, any job, at the other end. This is supposed to be one of the most hopeful, optimistic moments in your life.\nImagine sitting at home day after day, no money, nothing to do but wait for your fortnightly appointment at the JobCentre. We used to worry about getting our children onto the property ladder. Now we have to worry whether they'll ever get a job. There can be nothing more dispiriting at this formative moment. It destroys your self-confidence, perhaps for good.\nI want to say, to young people. I am sorry. I am sorry that you have been, already, let down so many times. I am sorry that you will spend your working lives burdened by the debts of a previous generation.\nBut sorry isn't good enough. Our job isn't to feel bad about problems, it's to fix them. My commitment to the next generation is simple. The Liberal Democrats will not fail you.\nA New Promise\nSo today we make a new promise to young people that they will not be unemployed for longer than 90 days before we find them work or training. Let me spell out what that would mean: If you lost your job today, we'd find you work, training, or a paid internship by Christmas. Right now, we would cancel Labour's VAT cut and use the money to invest in young people's futures.\nWe would pay for 10,000 more university places and 50,000 more college places this year. And we would introduce a new \"Paid Internship\" scheme to give people real job experience. With an allowance of £55 a week. Young people would get experience that could make all the difference when it comes to looking for a job.\nAnd you know. We could pay for 800,000 placements. for 800,000 young people. For the cost of just one weekend's VAT cut. If it's between 15p off a cinema ticket and a decent future. I know what we should choose.\nI have always believed that you can't make progress as a society unless every generation tries to do better for its children. That's an idea that's at the core of Liberal Democrat values. Providing opportunity for our children, even as we provide dignity and security in retirement and old age.\nTo build a fair society, you have to start with children. And you have to start young. In Britain today, a poor, bright child will be overtaken by a less intelligent, but wealthier child by the time he is seven. This has to change. The first few years are the most important in determining a child's future. Those first few years when their character, their personality are being shaped.\nThe first few years are the most important ones. That's why we've always said: scrap the Child Trust Fund, which gives people a cash handout on their 18th birthday. And invest the money when it can really make a difference. With classes of just 15 for five, six and seven year olds. The beginning of real change in Britain.\nIf you want to know how fair a society is. Look at its tax system. Britain's is painfully unfair. The poorest pay a bigger slice of their income than the richest. Polluters are allowed to get away with harming our environment without paying for the clean-up. And we lose as much as £40 billion a year to tax dodgers.\nThat's why the Liberal Democrats are going to reinvent the tax system to make it fair. Not changing the amount we raise, but changing who pays.\nWe will raise the income tax threshold to £10,000, funded by closing loopholes that the wealthy exploit. And by making sure polluters pay for the damage they cause. I'll be honest. If you've got a house worth over a million pounds. If you fly trans-Atlantic a couple of times a month. If you get a seven-figure bonus paid in share options to get round income tax. You will pay more.\nThat is what is fair. Why on earth should you get tax subsidies paid for by people whose salaries are just a tiny fraction of yours? I don't want to penalise people who work hard. If you can make it big: all credit to you. But what it should win you is respect, not exemption from your tax bill.\nIn exactly the same way as on public spending. Many of these decisions on tax will be difficult. Taking them is the price of fairness. If we are brave enough to take them. It will be the beginning of real change in Britain.\nSo if there's one policy you take away from this conference. One policy to mention on every doorstep, in every phone call, in every leaflet. Let it be this one.\nWe will deliver fair taxes Under a Liberal Democrat government, people will not pay a single penny of tax on the first £10,000 they earn. Millions of people will find themselves with an extra £700 in their pocket, and up to four million low earners and pensioners will pay no income tax at all. The beginning of real change in Britain.\nAfter the expenses scandal, people are crying out, rightly, for something different at Westminster. Labour and the Conservatives have betrayed them. They offered warm rhetoric about change when the scandal was at its height. And then did nothing. They will defend the status quo to the last breath.\nOnly the Liberal Democrats will clean up Westminster, reform expenses, end big donations and elect the Lords. Only the Liberal Democrats will give people the right to sack MPs who are found guilty of serious wrongdoing. And only the Liberal Democrats will secure, once and for all, fair votes for everyone.\nThat means radical electoral reform, argued for from first principles. Not just some minor tinkering, put forward by a dying Labour government as a last, desperate attempt to save its skin.\nWe must do away with safe seats. Did you know, nearly half of Britain's constituencies have elected the same party in every election since I was born? These are seats where you could put a red or blue rosette on the back end of a donkey and it would still win. Only when every MP has to do a decent job and win the trust of the people they represent will we ever clean up politics for good. It will be the beginning of real change in Britain.\nImagine a Liberal Democrat Cabinet\nImagine a Liberal Democrat cabinet. Maybe the odd heated meeting. But imagine Liberal Democrats at work.\nDr Vince Cable, of course, in his office at the Treasury. Ushering in fairer taxes.\nCutting the banks down to size. Tearing up the Treasury red tape that strangles local government. And that's all between breakfast and lunch before he rattles off another book for the day.\nI tell you, when it comes to bankers' bonuses, I can't think of anyone better to send into the negotiating room. You think Vince would listen to those reckless bankers demanding their millions? He'd say what we all believe: There will be no bonuses for failure, not today, not tomorrow, not ever again.\nThen there'd be David Laws at the schools department, hunting down all those boxes and boxes of bureaucratic rules and paperwork that get in teachers' way, and throwing them out. I mean, recycling them. And if the civil servants say the pupil premium is too complicated. They can't work out how to invest the extra money to the benefit of the most deprived children. You know David will do the maths himself.\nChris Huhne at the Home Office. Restoring the civil liberties so shamefully discarded by this Labour Government on his first day with a Freedom Bill. Cancelling ID cards to help fund 10,000 more police on the streets. You know Chris won't be put off by technocrats saying it can't be done. He'll produce volumes of statistics showing he's right and look sternly over his glasses until they cave in.\nNorman Lamb reinventing our NHS for modern times, giving communities and patients a real say. Professor Steve Webb getting to work at the crack of dawn to improve pensions for women. Sarah Teather and Norman Baker, building Britain's infrastructure - the homes we need and the public transport we deserve. Julia Goldsworthy, devolving so much power to local communities she finds she can halve the size of her department.\nAnd, Simon Hughes, taking charge of environment and energy policy. This is a man who's faced death threats to bring a killer to justice. Who's been involved in every environmental campaign you can think of since the 1980s. He isn't going to listen to vested interests who say \"it's too difficult\". He'd set our course for the zero carbon future we need. The beginning of real change in Britain.\nThe Beginning of Real Change for Britain\nClimate change is the greatest challenge of our age, no doubt about it. But it's also, very much, a challenge of our age. Like so many of the problems governments have to deal with. From financial regulation to terrorism and internet crime.\nIt crosses borders.\nYou can't stop the weather at the cliffs of Dover. That's why the big deals, the ones that matter, are struck at international forums - like Copenhagen this December. A summit that must, must agree an international plan of action to keep global warming not just below 2 degrees, but below 1.7 degrees. Because that's what the best science tells us is now needed to prevent catastrophic climate change.\nWho do you want representing Britain at a crucial summit like that? Labour? They have let us down internationally. It wasn't just Iraq. It was their disregard for European colleagues, refusing to attend summits, grandstanding about how superior they were. It was their disregard for international law. Their backroom deals with Saudi Arabia over BAE, with Libya over Lockerbie, with America over torture. Labour has undermined Britain in the world.\nBut what's the alternative? William Hague? David Cameron and William Hague think the nineteenth century state still makes sense in a twenty-first century world. They simply do not understand that in an age of globalisation power must be exercised by nations together, not squandered by nations going it alone.\nWilliam Hague gives speeches about the enduring importance of the English speaking world. When everyone knows the new power centres are China, India and Brazil. A Cameron-Hague foreign policy would be the most insular and self defeating in modern times. How much influence would they have in Berlin, in Paris, in Brussels? Not a gram. Or even an ounce. And because they wouldn't stand tall in Europe, they would count for little in Washington too.\nBut there is a third option. Imagine Liberal Democrats around the negotiating table.\nEd Davey, our outstanding shadow foreign secretary. Drawing on the wisdom of Shirley Williams. Paddy Ashdown. Ming Campbell. We would secure Britain a stronger role in the world. By putting us at the heart of the European Union and committing us to abide fully by international law.\nThe beginning of real change for Britain.\nGo with Your Instincts: Vote Liberal Democrat\nYou know, before I went into politics I managed development aid projects in Central Asia. I led negotiating teams on international trade deals with China and Russia. I worked on new rules to help create the largest single market in the world, here in Europe. I've seen how different things could be if Britain would only play its cards right.\nI know there are people who agree with a lot of what we've got to say. But who still don't vote Liberal Democrat. You don't think we're contenders. I urge you to think again.\nIf you don't agree with our policies. If you don't want big change in Britain. Then don't vote for us. But if you like what you hear. If you share our vision for a different kind of future. Then go with your instincts; vote Liberal Democrat.\nElections are decided by your cross on the ballot paper. Power is not any party's to be inherited. Power is yours to give to whoever you choose.\nSo don't turn away, don't stay at home, don't vote Conservative just because you think it's the only option. This is Britain. We don't settle for second best because we think it's inevitable. We don't compromise on our beliefs because people might not agree with us. We stand up for our values with our heads held high.\nSo when you enter that polling booth, choose the future you really want.\nMake no mistake: the Liberal Democrats will do things differently in Britain. But if you want real change in Britain, you have to take a stand. If you want what we propose, you have to vote for it.\nIf you want tax cuts for ordinary people, paid for by closing loopholes for the very rich. If you want the right to sack your MP if they're proved corrupt. If you want children to start out at school in classes of just 15. Then vote for it.\nIf you want our prisons to work, so there's less crime. If you want a lasting job in a new, green economy. If you want Britain to stand tall again in the world. Then vote for it. This is a vital moment in the history of our country. And you have the power to shape it.\nLabour is lost. They haven't the ideas, energy or vision to start again. If you voted for them in the past, you have a choice. You can give away your vote to a fringe party. You can stay at home in despair. Or you can join with the Liberal Democrats and make the difference.\nIf you supported Labour in 1997 because you wanted fairness. You wanted young people to flourish. You wanted political reform. You wanted the environment protected. Or you simply believed in a better future. Turn to the Liberal Democrats. We carry the torch of progress now.\nThe choice at the next election is fake change from the Conservatives. Or real change from the Liberal Democrats. At a time like this.\nA time of real crisis. Britain cannot afford to be taken in by David Cameron's illusion of change. Britain needs leadership from a party with real passion, and it's the Liberal Democrats.\nThere is hope for a different future, a different way of doing things in Britain, if we are brave enough to make a fresh start. So let today be the first day of the future of British politics. It may be only the beginning. But it is the beginning. The beginning of real change in Britain.\nIf you want things to be different, really different, choose the party that is different.\nChoose the Liberal Democrats.",

Hourly parking will rise from 70p to 80p and a season ticket will increase from £90 to £95.\nIt means Brentwood council expects to earn a total of £1.7million from parking in William Hunter Way, Hart Street, Crown Street and Coptfold Road multi-storey car park in Brentwood, and Hunter Avenue and Friars Avenue in Shenfield in 2009 and 2010 - less than this year's expected £1.8million.\nCllr Louise McKinlay, chairman of Brentwood council's Highways Panel, has defended the increases, insisting that extra investments have to be paid for and that finances need to be balanced during the recession.\nShe said: \"There is no evidence that people will be put off parking in Brentwood due to the increases.\nWe want to keep charges as low as possible. But if you want investment in car parks, the money has to be there.\"\nVarious proposals, such as a £160,000 deep-clean and installation of new lighting at the multi-storey car park are planned, and the council says it needs to meet increased costs.\nCllr McKinlay added: \"For those people who park all day, the parking permits offer a massive reduction of 55 per cent.\n\"Our town centre is being significantly upgraded. The county council work in the High Street and the previous decisions by the borough's highways panel to revamp Crown Street and the car park are all set to provide us with a much improved shopping centre.\n\"The work to the multi-storey is the next step in this ambitious investment programme.\"\nBut Liberal Democrat leader Cllr David Kendall hit out at the increases.\nHe said: \"These increases will hit local retailers, businesses and residents very hard.\n\"Many people who live and work in Brentwood have to use their cars to get into the town because of the unreliable public transport links, and they are now going to be penalised at a time when they need the council's support the most.\n\"The council is already seeing a drop in demand for car park season tickets at the existing prices so, when the new increases come in, the situation is liable to become even worse.\"",

Astonishing isn't it?\n\"However, this has caused some excitement amongst mums in Brentwood and it occurs to me that the council is not as representative as we should be of the Brentwood community we are trying to represent. For instance, out of 37 councillors why are there only two mums of young children on the council? Why are there no non-white faces? Why are there only five councillors under 40 and only three of those under 30? Why are there only six or so commuters amongst us? Why are there no council tenants at all?\n\"It seems to me that one reason is that people often feel you need to be a certain \"type\" of person to be a councillor - a \"politician\" if you will, but this just isn't true. Many of us are quite normal - I'm no career politician myself having not been elected until I was 36! We do this as well as having family, friends, jobs and a life!\n\"Most of the Liberal Democrat councillors on Brentwood got involved because something was affecting their community - for Cllr Vicky Davies it was the presence of rats where she lived at the time, for Cllr Phil Mynott it was the William Hunter Way development, for Cllr Graeme Clark it was the speeding on his road and for me a campaign to stop a development at Thorndon Country Park. Just normal people who cared about their community and realised, on all these occasions, that it was the Lib Dem councillors who were working and fighting with them. So, we joined them and here we are!\n\"Recently, whilst the Tory administration have been tearing each other to pieces and their factions have finally splintered and the leader of the Labour group (of two) heralds the rise of socialism in Brentwood disregarding the fact that his party finished a poor fourth/last place with 31 votes in the recent by-election, the Liberal Democrats have continued focusing on community issues - fighting to save the play areas and town centre disabled parking spaces, get action on potholes and poor pavements and stop our local services being sold off to the highest bidder because we know these issues are important to you.\n\"Community has always been at the heart of Liberal Democrat policy and, locally, that is something that we feel strongly and fight forcefully for.\n\"Could you be our next councillor representing your residents, speaking up for them and making their voices heard?

The inference that a female is asking for it (i.e. to be sexually attacked or mistreated) because of the way she chooses to dress is wrong, outdated and inappropriate in the extreme. Victim Supporti and The National Studentii are just some of the organisations that have condemned Cllr Hossack's views saying, correctly, that it is the perpetrator that is the cause of such a crime and not the victim. It is wrong for a representative of the people to make this sort of comment and lay blame on victims.\n2. The fact that such attacks - on men and women - are very rare in Brentwood and are not the issues that have been prevalent in the night time economy (these, for the record, have been anti-social behaviour, noise, litter and urination in the streets) shows a total misunderstanding of town centre issues, perhaps because Cllr Hossack is not a town-centre councillor.\n3. Cllr Hossack gave these statements in his capacity as Night Time Economy Working Party Chair and, yet, he did not follow the communications protocol or seek advice from the proper officer of Brentwood Council. (Obviously, if he had given the statement as a Conservative councillor it would have been a different matter, but this was not the capacity in which this was made. Nor did he make this statement as a town centre councillor commenting on issues raised with him in his ward work as he represents Hutton East). It is also disappointing that only this particular suggestion was given to the press in an attempt, it would seem, to grab headlines for the Tory administration before policy had been decided by the members Brentwood Council and, therefore, resulting in the council having to retract elements of the statement and field media questions, eating into limited officer resources.\n4. This will now over-shadow any attempts to provide a \"safe\" environment for those who need it and, we feel, there were other options available that could have been discussed and only then released to the press as the work of the group.\n5. It damages the reputation of our taxi trade. We feel that many taxi drivers have, or would, try to help if someone was in distress and needed assistance and we feel this is insulting to them.\n6. We object to Cllr Hossack's comments attacking one individual - a former member of the cast of \"The Only Way Is Essex\". Although views on #TOWIE are mixed, we cannot deny that they have assisted the town's economy since it began, opened new businesses in empty shops and attracted other businesses and tourist trade to town. With Brentwood being mentioned in national TV advertising, it has put us on the map in many ways.\n7. Cllr Hossack, also in an attempt to grab headlines, informed the Brentwood Gazette that there was \"money set aside\" for this project. It has been confirmed by officers that this is not the case, but this has already caused considerable damage.\n8. The comments have made Brentwood, and the members of Brentwood council, a laughing stock on a global scale with them being carried quite extensively in the national press (The Mirror, The Sun, The Daily Mail, The Telegraph), ITV, Channel 5 and as far away as Australian news - all with very negative comment on the \"meat market\" comments made by Cllr Hossack.\nThe consequence of the above means that Cllr Hossack's position as the chair of the working party is now untenable and we feel that he should be relieved of this position with immediate effect and replaced with a councillor who has a working knowledge of the town centre and its issues.

Our five wins here (out of 11 fought) pushed the country's Lib Dem win total over the 700 seats mark - not a bad result for a party that was being written off in recent years! I just thought I'd comment on a couple of interesting things which emerge from a closer look at the results across Brentwood.\nThe Brentwood Council website is stating that the Conservatives got 42% of the overall vote whereas we got 41%. However these figures actually involve rounding-off fractional percentages. By my calculations the overall number of unspoiled votes cast in Brentwood was 16,447. Of that total we gained 40.92%, whereas the Tories gained 41.56% - a wafer thin 0.64% gap. This is also a massive leap forward from last year, when the Tories got 45% of the vote and we only got 34.5%.\nFurthermore in terms of the actual totals, the Tories picked up 6836 votes this year, but the Lib Dems were right behind them, on 6731. In other words we were only 105 votes short of their total across the whole borough, and, of course, whereas they stood in all 12 seats up for election, we only stood in 11.\nIt's also very telling that our vote across Brentwood last year was 6,149 (so we've gained 585 from a decreased turnout), whereas the Tories' vote was 8,111 (so they've lost 1,275). The Labour vote also went backwards (down from 2,491 last year (just slightly under 14%) to just 1,719 this time round (10.45%).\nWhere we've been strongest recently we've consolidated, with Clly Vicky Davies getting more than 70% of the vote in the Pilgrims Hatch Lib Dem fortress for the second year running; Cllr Mark Lewis getting 57% of the vote in Brentwood North (with four parties standing, as against only three in Hatch); and Cllr Sarah Cloke winning the once knife-edge Brentwood West, against an ex-Mayor standing for the third time, with 48% of the vote (after Cllr Dominic Naylor's 51% against an unknown Tory last year).\nWhere we've done well we've shot forward, with Cllr Jay Laplain getting 49.58% of the vote in Warley and Cllr Andy Fryd marvellously grabbing 54% in Shenfield, where we were 300 adrift last time round.\nBut even where we weren't successful we've advanced significantly: Darryl Sankey in Ingatestone, Fryerning & Mountnessing continuing to reel the Tories in (202 behind last year, just 73 behind this year); Brenner Munden making ground on both Labour and the Tories in Brentwood South (370 behind Labour last year, just 228 behind this time); and Hugh Gorton on 39% against the Tories' 56% this time, after 27% (against 63%) previously.\nWith a number of new members now looking to stand next year, and those who didn't quite make it this time still up for the fight, we are looking strong for 2020.\nCllr Philip Mynott is deputy leader of the council group and has been councillor for Brentwood North since 2010.",

  "https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk/https_brentwoodlibdems_org_uk_news_article_your-community-needs-you/content_1388.html": "Your community needs you\nBrentwood Lib Dems are looking for people from all backgrounds that care about their community to stand for council in this year's borough elections.\nWhilst we always have a number of people who are already party members and wish to stand for election, we are keen to cast the net wider and offer more people the opportunity to be considered.\nYou don't have to be a die-hard politician - many of our councillors and activists aren't! Usually, they are just people who get involved to make a difference in the area where they live and that is exactly what we aim to do as Brentwood Lib Dems!\nIt's also not a full time or salaried job (although there is an allowance to cover costs such as mileage, postage, childcare etc.) and council meetings are held in the evenings allowing community-focused people to participate. It is important that the council has a diverse base of councillors who really understand what it is like to do normal things like work, commute, raise a family, balance the family budget, contribute to the community, enjoy a social life and apply these \"real life\" skills to the council. After all, the role of a councillor is to represent the people to the council, not the other way round.\nYesterday, Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, announced the participants in the Liberal Democrat Leadership Programme, supporting future Parliamentary candidates from under-represented backgrounds. We also hope to see more council candidates, and councillors, whom are female, from BME backgrounds, disabled, under 30, from a lower socio-economic background or from any Brentwood resident who would like to make a difference.\nCllr David Kendall said:\n\"It is disappointing to see Brentwood council is 65% male, with only six councillors under 40 and around a third of them of them 60 or over with no BME representation at all. We believe that the council needs to be representative of our community today with a mix of people of different ages, a more even gender balance, all financial situations and backgrounds.\n\"In 2011, we were proud that our six of our thirteen candidates were female, with a mix of ages from 18 to almost 70, whilst the Tories only fielded three female candidates and Labour fielded four. However, we recognise that we can do more and this is why we are going to the community to seek new candidates who may not have considered getting involved before.\"\nOn Thursday 3rd May 2012, we will be contesting the twelve seats that are up for election in Brentwood. Nine of these seats are Tory-held and, in all, 76% of the seats on Brentwood are too so we need strong people to put across the view of our community, rather than the view of the Conservative party (or vote with them, as Labour often do).\nThe Lib Dems are the main opposition in Brentwood and have constantly stood up against the Tory administration on issues such as saving Brentwood Town Hall, reducing car parking, campaigning against the shared Chief Executive and highlighting the Tories' mis-management of the finances. There is no Tory-LibDem coalition in Brentwood and our voting and campaigning record proves that to be the case!\nInterested? Well, if you are 18 or over by 30th March 2012, either registered to vote in Brentwood or have been resident or working in the borough for the previous year, have a genuine interest in what is happening in Brentwood, are supportive of the Liberal Democrats' local aims and objectives and want to make a difference in your community then please get in touch via phone to Cllr David Kendall on 07768 667 824, Karen Chilvers on 07774 248 362, by email to Chair Cllr Ross Carter on brentwood.ongarlibdems@gmail.com or via a Twitter DM to @LibDemsBwd.\nNOTES: You do not have to stand in the ward you live in - you can stand in any of the fifteen wards in the borough if you qualify as a candidate for Brentwood. The following seats are up for election in 2012: \"Brentwood North\", \"Brentwood South\", \"Brentwood West\", \"Brizes & Doddinghurst\", \"Hutton Central\", \"Hutton North\", \"Hutton South\", \"Ingatestone, Fryerning & Mountessing\", \"Pilgrims Hatch\", \"Shenfield\",\" Tipps Cross\" & \"Warley\". There are no elections in \"Herongate, Ingrave & West Horndon\", \"Hutton East\" or \"South Weald\" this year but, if you have an interest in these areas we would be happy to talk to you about standing neighbouring wards. Application is subject to an interview process and membership of the Liberal Democrats.\nPeople like YOU are councillors\nCase Study: Cllr James Sapwell\nJames, 21, was elected councillor for Brentwood North ward in 2011. He grew up in Brentwood, attended schools here and stood in the general election as an independent candidate in 2010 and, shortly afterwards, decided to join the Lib Dems, recognising them as the voice of Brentwood residents and the ones who were really opposing the Conservatives in Brentwood. Since being elected, James has been working with residents in his ward on a number of issues and has embraced the opportunity to support the fantastic work going on at Hopefield Animal Sanctuary,\nJames commutes to London daily and works in shipping. He's also Brentwood's youngest councillor!\nCase Study: Karen Chilvers\nKaren's involvement started when she learnt that there were plans for a theme park in Thorndon Country Park in 2005 and led a successful campaign to put a stop to it, with other local councillors and hundreds of residents. Karen served as councillor for Brentwood West from 2007-11 and secured a review of the signage of the Brook Street/M25 roundabout during her time as a councillor, as well as fighting over-development and successfully campaigning to save Warley Hill Post Office.\nKaren is a Chartered Marketer, animal charity volunteer and commuted to London during her time on the council.\nCase Study: Cllr Philip Mynott\nBefore he joined the Lib Dems, Phil was familiar to many in Brentwood as a key campaigner against the cinema and retail development in William Hunter Way that may see Brentwood look more like Romford or any other town. Disappointingly, despite the huge numbers objecting to the specific proposal the Conservatives ploughed ahead with their plans. After this decision was made, Phil joined us, appreciating the hard work, time and effort he had seen from his local Lib Dem councillors.\nPhil is an artist who has been a postman and copy-shop assistant and is now an exam invigilator.",

However we made it very clear we did not support every aspect of the budget, particularly the rent increases, the extra auditor costs incurred by the late sign off of the accounts and the serious delay over completing the Single Status project.\nOver the last few months the Lib Dem group have been accused of \"opposing for oppositions sake\" but the support given to this Tory budget proves once again that is clearly not the case. I have never voted for a Tory budget in my life and I did so last night with a heavy heart but at the end of the day you have to do what you believe is right for the residents of Brentwood and it was on that basis I made my decision.\nDuring the budget debate I put forward two amendments. The first was to purchase two new CCTV cameras to be used in the fight against anti-social behaviour across the Borough and the second was calling for a reduction of 5% in the Special Responsibility Allowance given to councillors. After a full debate it was disappointing to see both amendments defeated by the Tory administration.\nThe constructive position taken by myself and the Liberal Democrat group was in stark contrast to the stance taken by the sole Labour member Cllr Mike Le Surf which at times was bordering on the comical.\nCllr LeSurf offered no alternatives to the budget and his silly claims to be the only opposition to the Tories will end up counting for little with the electorate when they realise he has voted against a 2.1% reduction in the council tax and much needed investment in key services. His vote against has made It clear that Labour are not interested in helping and supporting hard pressed Brentwood residents during these difficult economic times. Over the years we have grown used to Cllr LeSurf voting with the Tories on issues like the County Partnership and the Highwood Hospital development but when it came down to getting behind a budget that was generally good for Brentwood his vote against showed his judgement to be sadly lacking.",

Only in the event of an emergency should meetings agreed at the start of the year be changed.\nRelunctantly, and for the good of Brentwood residents only, Cllr Chilvers concedes and the full council meeting is set for Wednesday 11th September with O&S now the following week.\nThe Legal Loophole\nAfter the moving of the O&S meeting, a couple of weeks later, and following a counsel's opinion, it transpires that the planning application CAN NOT be heard at full council as this clouds the authority's powers as a planning authority and a council.\nThis means that now the 11th September meeting will be a Planning meeting and there was absolutely no necessity to move O&S because it could have been added to the agenda on 3rd September!\nAlthough there was one other item on the agenda regarding the Town Hall, this was not time sensitive and could have been decided at full council on 23d October 2013.\nThe Pointless Planning meeting\nAlthough members were to discuss the planning application, they are constantly told by officers that nothing has changed so it should just be approved (impartial advice?) despite members pointing out that, in four and a half years, a number of thing have changed including new national planning guidelines.\nBrentwood North Councillors make their frustration known and outlines some of the things that now affect the application - it falls on deaf Tory ears.\nThe vote is won by the Conservatives to grant a two year extension eight votes to seven.\nThe farcical full council item\nUnder the new constitution adopted by the council says that \"information items\" are not to be brought to council meetings and, yet, the item on the William Hunter Way application is only an information point. Cllr Barry Aspinell questions this but, as usual, the constitution is bent to the will of the Tories.\nThe agenda item consists of two sides of A4 paper with no new information - members are to debate this and then \"vote to note\". In the end, many opposition members cast their vote as \"against the farce\".\nThe Tories keep telling us that the deal with the developer is almost signed and loads of things have moved on - Cllr Graeme Clark asks what exactly and it \"all goes quiet over there\".\nThe case of the missing agenda\nOn looking on her iPad for the meeting's agenda, Cllr Karen Chilvers notes that the agenda for the meeting is not there. Agendas must be published five days before the meeting or it can not be held. It looked like we might have been holding an illegal meeting that will have to be abandoned. Officers have to run off and check and the meeting is held up for ten minutes.\nBut there IS an explanation...\nConfidential matters - read all about it!\nIt transpires that the agenda was taken down briefly in the afternoon and not put back on the website. Why? Because the council had published confidential, commercially senstive information and it had to be removed. Certainly something that wasn't going to be shared with members!",

Not my words but the words of the Independent Auditor.\nThis has led to a situation under this Conservative administration where we:\n- Cannot get our accounts signed off.\n- Have misplaced £633K of taxpayers money\n- Have a lack of robust planning as a contributory cause to the financial challenges facing the Council.\n- Had unrealistic income projections in the 2008/9 budget\n- Failed to review the council's three year medium term strategy\n- Have a \"1\" rating which is the lowest you can get for our use of resources.\nNow, the Leader and her colleagues will tell us many of these problems are historical, they have been happening for years, it's the previous Lib Dem administration's fault. It seems it's everyone's fault apart from this administration. No one ever holds their hands up and actually says \"We're sorry we got it wrong\".\nBefore you start blaming everyone else let's look at a few facts.\n- You took control of the Council back in May 2004. Five and a half years ago. If things were so bad with our finances why didn't you make changes then?\n- You had an opportunity to reverse the decision on making the Brentwood Centre a Leisure Trust but you chose not to do so.\n- You could have appointed an experienced Head of Finance but you chose not to do so.\n- You could have set up an Audit Panel. Tory run Chelmsford has had one for a few years, but you chose not to do so.\nLet's look at what you have done.\n- You employed two senior finance officers on temporary contracts at a combined cost of £275,000 which is the equivalent of a 5.5% Council tax increase to our residents. One of these officers was paid £140,000 for 13 months work. Nice work if you can get it.\n- Back in September 2009, the Leader defended the recruitment of one of those officers in the paper by saying: \"This was a temporary position and it required someone with specialist qualifications\". But in the same paper a spokesman for the Tax Payers Alliance probably summed up many residents' feelings with the following quote:\" It is a new culture of excessive remuneration without proper scrutiny that has grown up in our Town Halls\"\nLooking back you have to ask the question who was managing and scrutinising these two officers and the rest of our finance dept to make sure they were doing the job they were paid to do? In this new age of transparency our residents quite rightly expect someone to step up to the plate and take some responsibility and accountability for the situation. I look forward to hearing the answer.\nWhen the Audit Commissions report was published why was it left to Mr McKenzie, an officer who'd only been with the Council a short time, to make a statement on the finances. Surely we should have had a statement from our Chief Executive on the matter, particularly as she and her officers had been overseeing and managing the structural changes.\nTurning to some of the specifics in this report:\nIf you look at Appendix 2a \"Analysis of budget monitoring\", you will see some very worrying trends. Yes, some of these trends are down to the economic downturn but others, I believe, are self inflicted by this administration.\nThe Audit Commission was definitely right to state that we had unrealistic income projections in the 2008/9 budget - take Car Parking. As we can see our revenue from car parking charges has been badly hit.\nThe Lib Dems called for a freeze on all car parking charges at last year's budget setting meeting and were accused of being irresponsible. But look at the facts:\n- When the budget was set we were told that demand for business season tickets was falling but what did this administration do? You put them up and have now made the situation even worse. We now have a £60,000 shortfall.\n- Other car parking income is also well down, which again wasn't helped by increasing the charges just prior to the High Street refurbishment starting. Didn't that cross anyone's mind when the charges were set?\nHaving spoken at length to Peter McKenzie, our new Head of Finance, I believe that if he is given the right support he can use his experience and expertise to start turning our finances round but he has a very tough job on his hands. We wish him well.\nFinally Mr Mayor. let me leave you with this thought. When the Liberal Democrats ran the Council:\n- We never had a situation where the accounts were not signed off.\n- We were regularly placed first as the best Council in Essex\n- We were recorded as the fifth best Council in the UK.\nThe Leader can play \"the blame game\" but after almost SIX years of the Tories running this council I will leave it to our residents to see through her empty rhetoric and decide for themselves who is responsible for this sorry state of affairs.",

This equates to 32,000 hectares net woodland increase annually for the next 30 years.\nSeveral councils have already undertaken to double the existing tree cover within their districts. If Brentwood is prepared to do its part, taking the size of Brentwood Borough as a percentage of the UK as whole, the Committee on Climate Change figures would equate to 600 hectares of new tree cover.\nWithout committing to specific targets at this stage, we therefore propose that Brentwood quickly move to develop a proper strategy for new tree planting - in part drawing on the strategies adopted by other authorities which have already taken up this challenge. This must result in proposals for Brentwood on a scale appropriate to the scale of the challenges facing us as a borough, a nation and a species. This strategy should not only address climate change. It should look at increasing protection to existing trees, increasing biodiversity, better enabling residents to connect with the natural environment, reducing levels of air pollution, and decreasing the existing flood risks.",

However the country is entering a new age post Brexit and Post Covid, and no matter what your opinions are on how each event was dealt with, the local elections and any future elections can be used to voice your views and have a say on if you are happy or not.\nHowever, as the title suggests this article will argue the importance of young people voting in the election. I believe it is vital that young people use their voice in society, something which I have campaigned for tirelessly but found much political apathy among the younger generation. This article will not attempt to answer why political participation is minimal across the majority of 18 to mid-20 age range. However I do find it ironic that before the 2016 referendum I saw first hand young individuals being told to vote as it is our national duty, but when thousands of young people stood up for a second vote to Brexit, the same older generation of individuals said instead that its best to leave the future in their capable hands and silenced us over Brexit. However my franchise of voters are arguably the most impacted, especially in the long term results and that is why its important for young people to go out and vote.\nSo why is it important for young people to vote? The simple answer is that the impact of recent events and decisions have had on the younger generation is huge. Without a doubt the Covid pandemic has affected everyone, and we are all essentially in the same boat heading towards an unclear future.\nHowever, even without Brexit and Covid in the picture, life for the younger generation seemed bleak.\nHome ownership is extremely unlikely for young people in the future. 1 in 3 will never be able to own a house, with 67% of 'Millenals' having to wait over 20 years in full time employment before being able to afford a house, and of course paying extremely high rent in the meantime. This is also based on young people in full time employment with a comfortable wage, however the current job market is arguably the most competitive it has ever been. Throw in the factor of businesses and industries at risk of closing due to Brexit and/or Covid makes the idea of secure employment harder to believe. Of course we entered a completely unprecedented time due to the Covid19 Pandemic. The pandemic quickly shone a light on the vulnerabilities in society. From the struggling NHS to accommodating the homeless, it was clear help was required to the most vulnerable, and rightly so. The country saw families on benefits and many people lose their jobs, (even some who were unable to be furloughed) therefore facing immediate debt and needed to be financially supported. Thousands of businesses up and down the country that lost out on profit due to lockdown had to be rightly supported by grants. However all of this spending has left a bill which needs to be paid. And as well as the uncertainties post Brexit, a bigger bill will be produced. For example, some industries in the UK have now lost out to EU funding and for these companies to survive they have called on the government to fill the gap. With no sign of the £350 million promised, it is the UK tax payer who will be paying. However, the bulk of this total bill will be repaid in our futures. It is today's young individuals whose future taxes will be spent to help the country recover from a potentially very dark economic period equivalent to the time\nafter the global financial crash which saw the age of austerity.\nArguably, young people have lost more and are due to lose more in the UK, not only because of an unprecedented phenomena (for example the possibility of Covid passports which ignores young people not being vaccinated) but also due to the idea of taking back control in 2016. We lost the right to travel freely around Europe and to work and study across the EU. Instead we will struggle to find work, housing and fund luxuries. Of course we are not the first generation to face struggling times, but instead of learning from lessons to make life better, we were silenced. And one thing which I have not mentioned but which young people have stood up to be vocal about is the environment. Protecting theenvironment is absolutely essential. For too long the affects of polluting our earth \"is a problem for people in the future\" and therefore action must be taken before it gets too late. So now is the time to protest and make a change.\nBy voting in any election, young people can use their voice to change politics for the best and have a say in our future and our lives. If you're young and reading this then please simply go out and vote. For anyone else reading, make sure you vote but also tell your children and/or grandchildren that they should do the same. Because very vote counts.\nAbout the writer\nBrenner Munden is a 22 year old graduate who joined the party in 2016 and standing for local council in Brentwood South.

The magistrates said it was a very difficult decision to make and they certainly took a long time in recess making it.\n\"As this is an all or nothing process you either win or lose and you never know how close you came to having the opposite outcome. I think we may have come quite close to getting the opposite outcome - which, given that we were three untrained, non-professional objectors up against the council's top barrister is pretty good going.\n\"On the ground this decision may, however, mean that nothing whatsoever changes - this was not an application to physically block the route out of North Road Avenue across the disabled car park and the alternative route which has been created means that access to the High Street (albeit by a much less satisfactory route) is guaranteed.\n\"However the main issue now is the fact that the council is in the last stages of negotiation to sell the disabled car park to Barclays. A council asset is going to be sold, but this hasn't ever been raised, let alone discussed at Asset Panel. So, a significant financial transaction (albeit a land swap) is about to take place without any apparent financial scrutiny, or public discussion of it.\n\"Although this decision emerges out of the delegated powers process around the William Hunter Way development agreement back in 2007, the sale of the disabled car park to Barclays was NEVER mentioned, let alone discussed, as an inevitable consequence of the William Hunter Way plans. Tory councillors who voted in favour of the William Hunter Way plans will not have done so knowing, or having been told, that this sale would happen.\n\"Brentwood Council also seem to have now been advised that they can go through this process without submitting any planning application (despite having started, paused and then scrapped entirely a planning application to itself to change the use of the car park site in March). Currently, other than through this now abandoned council planning application, the disabled residents of Brentwood have had no opportunity to object to the sale or have their say on it in any way. Like everyone else (including ward councillors), they have not even been officially told that it is intended to happen!\"",

The scale of the changes required is so great it will require a different way of taking decisions too.\n\"The standard model, of Governments elected with a minority of popular support, cooking up fiscal plans behind closed doors in Whitehall, imposing cuts from on high is a recipe for Greek-style social and industrial strife.\n\"So we need to find new ways to arrive at decisions so that politicians put the long term national interest above their own short term interests and actively involve the public in the decisions taken.\n\"The Liberal Democrats would establish a cross party Council for Financial Stability.\n\"We would invite the economic spokespeople of all the major parties, the Governor of the Bank of England, and the Head of the Financial Services Authority to join the Council.\n\"The purpose would be to force the politicians to put the long term national interest ahead of their own narrow political interest, and agree the basic timetable and scale of deficit reduction in the years ahead.\n\"Agreeing that timetable according to sound economic tests, like those Vince Cable has already set out as a means of judging when to begin the process of fiscal contraction:\n\"The rate of growth; the level of unemployment; credit conditions; the extent of spare capacity in the economy; and the cost of Government borrowing.\n\"This would not prevent political parties from arguing about what changes should be made to taxes and in public spending, or which areas of taxation and spending should be immune from any change, but it would force the whole political class to come clean and tell the people of Britain what the scale of the changes actually will be.\n\"With a structural deficit now estimated at £80bn, and market confidence shaken by the unwillingness of the politicians to spell out what they're committed to achieving, it is essential that politicians of all parties demonstrate that they will no longer play games with the stability of Britain's long term financial reputation.\n\"Including the monetary and banking authorities will also allow for a more coherent debate about the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy. As well as the role of the financial services sector in underpinning, not undermining, growth.\n\"Crucially, given that the full elimination of the structural deficit will almost certainly take more than one parliament, an agreed approach on the overall scale and timetable of fiscal consolidation will provide both the British public and the markets with the assurance that a consistent and responsible approach will not be hijacked by politics in the future.\"",

She made it clear that the Liberal Democrat group was elected as the opposition locally and would carry out that role fully and responsibly as they hold the Conservatives to account.\nCllr Higgins said:\n\"We find ourselves today in a strange position. At a national level we are, of course, in coalition whereas, here in the County the Liberal Democrats are the Opposition Party to the Conservatives.\n\"Many of the problems outlined in the Leader's statement emanate from the massive mismanagement of public finances by the previous Labour Government. However we, the County Liberal Democrats, were elected in 2009, and we are in Opposition. Our job is to hold the Administration to account.\n\"The Council is already trying to save £300 million over three years, which will impact on our residents. We do understand that nationally:\n- for every £300 raised, £400 was spent,\n- and the difference raised by borrowing money, leaving this country with a huge deficit, which is not sustainable.\n- it is appreciated that having grant cuts during the year makes an already difficult situation even worse.\n\"In tackling these figures it is important to emphasise a number of principles:\n- Maximum transparency is required, so that our staff, our councillors, and the public of Essex are aware of what is going on. A particular concern has been raised about the impact of the cuts in the LSP / Essex Partnership Funding, and its impact on very valuable projects negotiated through the LAA, where organisations had every right to expect grants, and cut-backs in these areas could have a disproportionate affect on vulnerable groups.\n- Everything must be done to try and protect front-line services and vulnerable groups. This is also why I have two questions on the Agenda later about Mobile Libraries and Meals on Wheels. As one disabled person put it to me \"why do I have to prove to George Osborne that I am disabled?\"\n\"While we understand that timescales are tight, we would like assurances that consultation and public engagement will be meaningful. The opportunities for residents to comment need to be as wide as possible - many of our residents do not access the internet. I do hope that an equality impact and needs assessment has been carried out on the consultation process. What format will the results of the consultation be shared with members, and residents, and when will we be told of the staff ideas?\n\"We understand that councillors need to be empowered to make decisions in our own areas. The Cabinet system, supported by numerous officers, make the decisions; if non-executive members are to be accountable, they need back-office research support. We have great concerns over the burden placed on the voluntary sector, who are facing the same serious cuts as local government, but there is a danger they will be over-burdened.\n\"The Local Economic Partnership is meant to be a partnership with business and local people. A lot of people feel that Essex County Council is remote. A full county LEP may not be the path to take for this county. Local partnerships at a local level is what is needed, and does not have to be restricted to present boundaries. The residents want transparency - for them concepts such as the 'Big Society' are meaningless. We welcome an integrated county strategy. I do hope that the districts and boroughs will be consulted. We believe this could be moved forward using the example of highways localism. Having devolved the budget to local areas and, indeed, parishes, this could serve as a good model for other departments. We know through Total Place Pilots that there is duplication of information collected.\n\"Finally, in summary, what we seek is:\n- Clarity on over-funding and what responsibilities will be developed locally;\n- How will this all be scrutinised and will the responsibility be with the Leader?\n\"We will work with the Administration in a constructive way to make sure the most vulnerable of our residents are protected.\"\nCllrs Barry Aspinell and David Kendall issues the following statement:\n\"We fully endorse and support the comments made by Cllr Theresa Higgins.\n\"Whilst we support the general thrust of the coalition Governments announcement we will continue to hold the Conservatives running Essex County Council to account every step of the way.\n\"If the County are serious about devolving real power to local groups and the voluntary sector then the Liberal Democrats will fight to ensure that the funding stream follows to deliver the service.

In addition, they cause distress to the sick, vulnerable and those with mental health issues. There are also concerns over their environmental impact.\n\"There are alternatives such as silent fireworks and drone light shows. With Brentwood residents contacting us regularly with their concerns and major supermarket chains halting their sale, it is surely time to review the use of traditional, outdated fireworks and look for a new way to celebrate in 2020.\n\"Unfortunately, councils' powers are limited. Stopping their sale has no impact as people can buy elsewhere and restricting them by licensing powers covers barely any fireworks events as most are private. Licensing officers advised that major reform can only be made at parliamentary level. Therefore, Brentwood Council resolves to write to Alex Burghart MP to request that he formally engages with the RSPCA (the organisation campaigning to change fireworks legislation) and report back within six months\".",

The current Conservative mantra and response that 'we need to build new homes', whilst true, cannot be done without consideration towards the environmental impact of these plans.\nWith the extensive plans of local development, more than ever, we need environmental concerns addressed through every stage of the process. As such, with the building of new homes, what will the impact be of increased cars? Not only do we need to know what our transport links are, but do these services remain viable? Are bus services, threatened? Are train services accessible for everyone?\nThere is still plenty of progress to be made on many environmental issues locally such as air pollution and the potential of flooding, as the local development plan highlights.\nIn my ward of Brentwood North, proposals have been received by Tesco, outlining plans to build 450 homes on the Hopefield Animal Sanctuary site near Doddinghurst Road where parking and access are huge concerns and Ongar Road, a main route into the Town centre, currently a section lying within an air quality management area. This is a development that could profoundly affect the local community in terms of its environmental impact.\nLiberal Democrat policies on the environment are clear and driven by those that have the energy and passion to fight to keep them on the agenda all the time.\nTherefore, we must ensure that all issues concerning our environment, although highly complex, are continuously addressed and the needs of our environment are fully met.",

The Liberal Democrats have always said that Brentwood residents should not have to pay to park in their own Country Parks but we appreciate the difficulty of achieving that objective in the current economic climate.\nAt a meeting of Brentwood Borough Council's Health Housing and Leisure Panel (18/11/09) the car parking charges were discussed and members were asked to consider the options that were available so that suggestions could be put forward to the next meeting of the Joint Committee for Country Parks and Estate.\nDuring the discussion Cllr Kendall put forward the following motion which after much debate and an amendment was given unanimous support by the members of the panel:\n1. That for a trial period of one year, all types of car parking charges for the Weald and Thorndon Country Parks should be reduced by 50% to try and encourage greater usage of the parks by existing and new park users.\n2. That more large scale events should be planned particularly for Weald Country Park to raise more income for the sole use of the parks.\n3. If there was a shortfall in the overall income to the parks from car parking charges and an increased programme of commercial events then the proposal would need to be underwritten by the County Council, as Brentwood is not in a position to do so.\nThe aim of the Liberal Democrat motion was to try and encourage much greater usage of the parks by all residents from Brentwood and beyond.\nAt the meeting members also expressed a desire to see a reduction in car parking charges for pensioners. Cllr Kendall and Cllr Chilvers fully supported that stance and hoped that it would also be addressed by the Joint Committee.\nIdeally this trial would only be available to Brentwood residents to minimise the financial risk and to meet the strong call we have had locally to reduce and ultimately scrap charges. However the practicalities of introducing the measure just for Brentwood residents in the short term would be difficult to overcome as we have no way of identifying where the park users are from if they are just paying the daily charge.",

There is already a thread of anxiety running through the seasonal cheer and in the next 12 months we will see a dramatic deterioration in economic conditions.\nThe public mood will change as people gradually realise that we are in the economic equivalent of wartime.\nA generation has grown up expecting a predictable future, a boring one even.\nThere has been a steady improvement in living standards, full employment, rising house prices and reliable, solid banks.\nYet within a few months, the world has turned upside down.\nThe people I meet are worried, frightened, cross and, above all, confused as to what is going on, how we got here, and what is the sensible thing to do.\nShould we all spend more to keep the economy going, they ask, or should we stop spending and save more to reduce personal debt?\nShould the Government be spending on our behalf to keep people in work or is that storing up the pain of higher taxes and inflation?\nIs the top priority to help people in debt and those facing home repossession, or should we help those who have seen their private pensions and interest on their savings disappearing?\nIs a falling pound good for the economy by helping exports or bad by penalising people who travel abroad?\nThe honest answer is that even the most clever and public-spirited people are divided on these issues.\nDecisions must be made amid great uncertainty. When I worked for a multinational oil company - supposedly advising on the future - I was always reminded of the Arab saying: 'Those who claim to forecast the future are lying, even if by chance they are later proved to be right.'\nYet even if predictions are rash there are some deeper trends that are already in train and will be all too evident in 2009.\nFew of them are optimistic. Unemployment will rise perhaps to three million. A lot of those who lose their jobs face losing their houses unless the Government steps in more decisively than it has so far.\nHouse prices will fall further to, perhaps, 40 per cent below their peak and will soon begin to look cheap.\nA lot of companies will bite the dust - retailers, construction firms, the travel industry and big football clubs will go the way of Woolworths.\nThe battle for survival will also be thoroughly nasty. Constituents in precarious jobs tell me that their bosses are cutting their wages, not paying their salaries or worsening their conditions of employment.\nA worker in the film industry and a building subcontractor both told me this week that they are reluctantly accepting big pay cuts to hold on to work.\nThere is a danger of the vulnerable being trampled underfoot. Charities report a drastic reduction in income at a time when they are expected to do more.\nNot that everyone will lose out in 2009. It could be like the Thirties, when those in work were enjoying rising living standards, boosted by low or negative inflation. The Jarrow marchers, meanwhile, were destitute.\nAt present, those on tracker mortgages are enjoying the cheapest rates for a generation. Some savers are doing well.\nMy wife Rachel, who claims to know nothing about money, put her savings into a two-year fixed interest deposit account - at six per cent - with a traditional building society, while I thought I was being clever investing in shares and now daren't open the envelope telling me what they are worth.\nPensioners on a basic state pension with small savings will struggle as always, but at least the cost of living will be lower in the coming months.\nMoreover, their pensions will be calculated according to the high inflation figures of the autumn rather than the lower rates prevailing now, so their incomes will be boosted.\nHeating bills have been shockingly high but will now fall again. Petrol is also cheaper.\nAnd for those in secure jobs with decent employers and with low debts, there are few worries.\nLife looks especially good for those in safe public-sector jobs who have the additional bonus of a generous pension scheme.\nPain will be concentrated on those whose businesses have gone to the wall, those with insecure jobs and those with excessively large mortgages and other debts.\nThere is a danger of a big gulf opening up in society between those who are not touched by the recession and those who are seriously damaged by it.\nThe Government is getting credit for taking action, belatedly, but it must not throw around taxpayers' money carelessly; ultimately we all pay in higher taxes or inflation or both.\nThat is why the temporary VAT cut was a bad idea - it gave the impression that £12billion of revenue could be tossed away to pay for a Christmas binge.\nThat is why we also have to worry about Ministers waving a chequebook around when failing companies come visiting.\nIt is easy to sympathise with those in the car and car component industry appealing for government help. But if cars, then why not cement or chemicals, or shops for that matter?\nAre Woolworths' workers any less deserving? Governments simply cannot go down the road of propping up every industry in trouble.\nThere is a fundamental difference between bailing out specific companies and supporting the banks.\nGovernments, including our own, are trying to save their banking systems, not to be nice to bankers but because banks supply the oil that keeps the economic engine going. If banks fail, everything else fails.\nA better idea is carefully targeted public investment that creates a long-term asset for the taxpayer, generates employment and, hopefully, does something useful such as improving the environment.\nIn America, President-elect Obama has shifted the balance of argument in favour of governments acting decisively rather than watching the crisis unfold.\nHis 'green New Deal' has the right flavour and we should aim to do something similar here.\nThere is plenty of scope for investing in the overcrowded rail system and alleviating the dreadful shortage of affordable housing for families on average incomes.\nThe absolutely central task for the New Year is restoring normal bank lending.\nI was one of the first people to identify and criticise greedy, foolish bankers, long before this crisis. But we are now well beyond the point where it is useful to lecture them further or lock them all up.\nDavid Cameron's moral indignation is several years too late.\nWhat is now needed is action to get the banks lending again, yet they are given contradictory signals by government: lend more to small companies and house buyers; lend less and build up reserves; cut your lending rates; repay taxpayers' loans as quickly as possible.\nMinisters should set out their priorities clearly and instruct the banks to follow them since they are now, even if not nationalised, dependent on the Government for survival.\nIn the New Year the Government may have to take more direct control of the banks; to restructure them, stripping out their casino operations; and ensuring that banks do their job of lending to sound businesses and households.\nWe must recognise the need for government to act and invest, to keep the economy afloat in the current emergency conditions but to prepare us psychologically for a period beyond in which there has to be much greater financial discipline, both public and private.\nThere is, however, a deeper and bigger question: how to maintain a sense of national unity and purpose while the crisis unfolds.\nThere is a vacuum of leadership waiting to be filled. Even if all the steps taken by governments work, it will take time to produce results.\nNext year will be like an economic battle in which there are mounting casualties coming back from the front line but no sign of victory.\nI believe the public will see the need to 'stick together' and, in particular, will expect the political parties to rise above the usual petty, tribal bickering.\nThere will be calls for a 'government of national unity', to get political adversaries round a table working together rather than pointing fingers at each other.\nThere must, of course, be vigorous debate and public accountability, as well as unity, but I think the public senses that this is not what they are getting at the moment.\nI see the personal and party animosities played out every week at Westminster and wonder if the political classes are capable of grasping the enormity of the crisis we are in and the challenge to us to behave differently.\nIf we do not, the public will become seriously angry. We know from history that such anger can lead to extremes.\nBeyond the narrow confines of party politics there will be, I believe, a change in public morality that may last for a long time: a strong reaction against the culture of gambling that has brought financial institutions to their knees; a renewed faith in manufacturers, engineers, scientists, inventors and genuine wealth creators rather than spivs playing the money markets and exploiting tax havens; a greater respect for personal self-reliance, whether it is prudent saving or growing our own food; a rejection of ostentatious unearned wealth of the kind flaunted by the Russian oligarchs and Arab sheikhs who treat Britain as their second home.\nIt will no longer be acceptable for Ministers and mandarins (or MPs and peers) to have a feather-bedded existence, with large, protected pension pots, like First World War generals enjoying the comforts of a chateau at the rear while their men are fighting in the trenches.\nChurch leaders currently seem to grasp this new reality better than politicians.\nThere is a vacuum of leadership waiting to be filled by those who can translate a craving for fairness and the sharing of pain into the economics and politics of every day life.\nRemember that these new privations would not have impressed the generations who came before us.\nTheir lives were a great deal more taxing than ours today. So don't despair. At some point we will emerge from the economic gloom, although it is hard to predict quite when, and, provided we learn our lessons, we should be a stronger and better nation.\nThis is our chance to promote common sense, stability and the fair treatment of our fellow citizens. A happy and prosperous New Year to you all.\nVince Cable MP",

However, the plans also say Boris Johnson will not seek any extension despite overwhelming evidence showing that time-frame is near impossible.\nThis means that the Tories are signing up to crash the UK out of the EU without a deal, the Liberal Democrats claim.\nThis is why David has today written to Alex Burghart, the Conservative candidate, to ask him to rule out a no-deal Brexit in December 2020 which would cause severe economic damage and put jobs at risk in Brentwood & Ongar.\nKendall said:\n\"It is clear that the Conservatives are now effectively the party of Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. They are content to see the UK crash out of the EU without a deal.\n\"Boris Johnson's Brexit plan is already a disaster, but he has now made things even worse by putting the UK on a collision course with a no-deal Brexit in December 2020. That means more harm to our NHS, more uncertainty for businesses, more jobs lost.\n\"People in Brentwood & Ongar have a right to know if Mr Burghart supports the reckless and dangerous plan Boris Johnson is proposing. That is why I have written to him today by email to urge him to rule out supporting any deal that risks a no deal cliff edge in December 2020.\n\"The Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to stop Brexit. We are the strongest party for Remainers and we know that there is no deal as good as the one we have in the EU.\"\nNotes\n- Boris Johnson has refused to rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit when challenge by The Independent,see here.\n- The Prime Minister has also confirmed no-deal preparations will continue. He said: \"Of course preparations will remain extant, there's no reason to dismantle them,\" See here.\n- The Conservative manifesto states: \"We will not extend the implementation period beyond December \"\n- Many experts have said that the Government's timeline makes a no-deal exit more likely in December 2020.\n- The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that the UK crashing out of the EU would mean a £30 billion a year hit to our public finances.\n- The Institute for Government has described the certainty around securing a deal within this time-frame as \"zero\".\n- The Tory government's own 2018 analysis concluded that in a 15-year horizon, a no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by 9.3%.\nDavid's email to Alex Burghart, Conservative candidate\nDear Alex\nI am writing to you today to ask if you will rule out a damaging no-deal Brexit in December 2020 which would be disastrous for our local community.\nThe Brexit plan that your Party has proposed would require the completion of a Free Trade Agreement before the end of 2020 unless the UK asks for an extension. It is clear from your manifesto that the Tories will not seek an extension of the transition period in December 2020, despite overwhelming evidence from trade experts showing that it will be nearly impossible to secure a deal in that time-frame.\nBy signing up to such an arbitrary and unrealistic deadline, you are personally setting up the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal at the end of next year.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted that the UK crashing out of the EU would mean a £231 billion hit to our public finances over the next five years, equivalent to £8,000 per household. It also means another year of uncertainty for businesses in Brentwood & Ongar, costing jobs and prosperity in our area.\nYou have said you are prepared to sign up to Boris Johnson's deal, despite his decision to abandon legal commitments to maintain alignment with EU regulation protecting the environment and workers' rights, and the significant additional burdens it places on businesses trading with the EU. However, given the commitments in your manifesto not to extend the negotiation deadline, it now appears you are also content to see the UK crash out of the EU without a deal. You and I both know that this is unacceptable.\nSo, I am asking you today to unequivocally reject a no-deal Brexit, and to commit to not voting for any plan that would allow the continued risk of such severe economic damage to Brentwood & Ongar.\nThe people of Brentwood & Ongar deserve better.\nBest regards,\nDavid Kendall\nLiberal Democrat Candidate for Brentwood and Ongar",

Brentwood Borough Council rejected this in December 2021 due to concerns about highway efficiency, safety, air quality, and access viability. Lidl appealed, and their appeal was upheld in February 2023, granting them planning permission to meet certain conditions before starting work.\nDespite the appeal process affecting the relationship, constructive dialogue has resumed to minimise future impact on residents. Lidl is preparing the site and planning to begin construction in 2025. They are also addressing site maintenance issues following a request from Cllr Steve Mayo, as described below.\nWe fully agree with the residents we spoke to who branded the site as an eye-sore and noted the prevalence of creeping vegetation onto surrounding pavements. In response, Cllr Mayo met with a Lidl representative on-site to request a prompt tidy-up of the site exterior and agreed to a plan to maintain this while the project progresses. This was positively received. We will continue to monitor and raise issues as appropriate.\nResidents have noticed recent site activity for maintenance and trespass prevention. No building demolition has started yet. Any future actions will comply with building controls, mainly for asbestos risks. Lidl is also coordinating road plans with Essex Highways.\nFor more information, please get in touch with Councillors Phil Mynott, Alison Fulcher, or Steve Mayo.",

We believe that in the interests of openness and transparency you should know some important facts before then and make up your own minds on what is happening.\nThe Liberal Democrats in Brentwood have serious concerns about how this whole project is being taken forward by the Conservative administration running Brentwood Borough Council and we will hold them to account on this issue every step of the way.\nFACT - 12 February 2013 - The Conservatives announce they are allocating £165,000 towards the refurbishment of the Hutton Community Centre. Lib Dem Leader Cllr David Kendall calls for the matter to be deferred for more information and discussion by councillors but the call is rejected by the Tory Leader Cllr Louise McKinlay.\nTory Cllr Keith Parker speaks in favour of the £165k investment and says in his speech:\n\"...to make it safe, have it fenced, have it protected, if we haven't and don't start that at a very, very early nature anybody discussing what to do with that centre will find just a pile of rubble because that's how it's being used at the moment\"\nFACT - On 20 February Cllr Keith Parker's own company \"Process Installations\" submits a tender for the fence to go round the Hutton Community Centre. The bid by his company for £12,076.73 was just £146.75 lower than the next tender who are a specialist fencing contractor. The Borough Council's normal practice is to write to contractors with drawings, details of materials, requested, site details etc. However we are told that due to the urgency of the work (to protect the site) in this instance the contractors were approached by phone. The tenders from the other two contractors were received by the Council on 11 March. Cllr Parker's company is not a fencing company. If you google Brentwood fencing firms his company doesn't appear at all. We are not suggesting that Cllr Parker has done anything illegal in bidding for the fencing work. However we would certainly question if it is ethically right for any councillor of any poltical party to speak up in favour of substantial investment in a building and a fence to make it safe, and then actually put in a bid for that work themselves.\nFACT - On 12 March 2013 at the Audit Panel Meeting, following questions raised by a Lib Dem member, Cllr Keith Parker declares that he has a financial interest in the Hutton Community Centre after winning the tender for the fence. If these questions hadn't been asked by the Liberal Democrats we doubt wether anyone would have known what was going on.\nFACT - 10 April 2013 - Despite claims on 12 February that a fence was needed asap to stop vandalism and anti-social behaviour, and the rushed procurement process, two months later we are still waiting for the fence to be erected.\nFACT - A police investigation is currently underway which is looking into how a £50,000 grant from Essex County Council for refurbishing the Centre back in 2008 was spent. This investigation has nothing to do with the £165k recently allocated by Brentwood Borough Council.\nFACT - The Liberal Democrats position on the Hutton Community Centre is clear. We want to see investment in the building so that it can be refurbished and used once again by all who live in the community.

It comes after the Government instructed council-run schools to give teachers a much-deserved pay rise of between 5% and 8.9% this year, but gave schools no extra money to pay for it, meaning that they had to make cuts elsewhere.\nOverall, nine in ten schools across England will have less spending power next year compared to this year.

Nothing is safe or steady, but the road itself is appalling.”\nHe added that he had been highlighting the issue “since I became Leader of the Council.”\nIndeed, speaking at May’s Council meeting, he acknowledged residents' concerns. Speaking on the day the General Election was announced, the calling of which delayed further action, he said:\n“While Brentwood Council must play its part in addressing such issues, other bodies must share that responsibility. That means seeking a more joined-up and fully committed response.”\nThat includes Essex County Council, which Councillor Aspinell contacted in July to ask about plans for refurbishing the High Street. They confirmed they were aware of complaints, which would require a significant reconstruction scheme to fix, but no date was provided for when any designs might come forward.\nWhile limited repairs to broken paving stones were undertaken at his request last year, the need to fully repair the roads remains.\nIn the meantime, a grant from the Chewing Gum Task Force, administered by Keep Britain Tidy, will help Brentwood Borough Council clean up gum and reduce gum littering.

At the Policy Board meeting a heated discussion took place when Cllr Kendall made a verbal request for matters relating to Hutton Community Club to be discussed under urgent business. Once again his request was turned down.\nCllr Kendall said that if £165k of the Borough Council's money is being spent on aCommunity Centre then all the members of the Borough Council had a right to know the following points and be given an opportunity to discuss them at a Panel / Committe meeting:\n1) What is the timescale for the tendering and procurement process?\n2) What work has taken place on the Centre since the £165k was set aside at the budget setting meeting and who has carried out that work?\n3) Are the Council using approved contractors for any work on the Centre or can anyone apply?\n4) How are any volunteers who offer to do work on the Centre going to be managed by the Council?\n5) Who will be checking to ensure that any work done by the volunteers is to the standard the Council requires?\n6) Can we have details of the tendering and procurement process?\n7) Which Council officer is managing this whole process?\n8) When did the tender process start?\n9) When was the Hutton Community Centre signed over to the Borough Council?\n10) Do any members of the Conservative group have a financial interest in the Hutton Community Centre?\n11) When will members have an opportunity to discuss these issues at a Panel / Committee meeting?\n12) How is the Hutton Community Centre going to be managed going forward?\nThe Liberal Democrat group want to ensure that the correct protocols and procedures have been put in place to ensure that the £165,000 of public money is spent in a correct manner and that all members are made aware of what those protocols and procedures are.\nCllr Kendall called the decision not to discuss the Hutton Community Centre at the Policy Board a \"cover up\" because he could see no reason for the matter not be discussed in open session. He believes that if it had been discussed then various issues would have hopefully been clarified to members satisfaction and we could have moved on.\nThe Conservative administration running Brentwood Borough Council talks a lot about \"Openness and Transparency\" - now is the time to deliver it on this very important issue.",

This may require differences in when, how, and how much people pay towards the care system.\n- Fair eligibility: Eligibility should be based on need and must be widened to ensure that those of any age with unmet or under-met need have access to appropriate support. Eligibility must also guarantee parity of esteem across physical, mental and cognitive health.Improving integration: Health and care services should be designed to work more effectively together, with personalised care and prevention at the heart of both\nservices. Health and care services should deliver treatment and care at the right time and place and guarantee maximum personal control to the recipients of care. - Sustainability: Establishing a sustainable social care system will require closing the existing funding gap in the short term, as well as establishing a permanent funding settlement that would enable both members of the public and care providers to plan for their long-term future. Levels of funding should also sustain a diverse and stable market of providers.\n- Valuing the workforce: More workers should be recruited to, and retained within, the care sector. Furthermore, those who work within the care sector should be offered increased pay, higher quality training (along with the protected time away from work to undertake training), opportunities for career progression, and new career paths.\n- Supporting carers: Unpaid carers should be eligible for increased support from the state. Additionally, offers of care should not be reduced on the basis\nthat someone may be a recipient or possible recipient of informal care. - Accessibility: The criteria and assessment process for receiving state-funded care should be simple enough for everyone to understand, with guidance on\noffers of care to be made widely available. In addition, assessments of individuals' care needs should be conducted by appropriately-trained assessors.",

This is also part of a collaborative campaign to persuade the leadership at Brentwood Council to come clean and to begin to walk the walk of openness and transparency in their dealings in order that their actions start to match their rhetoric in this regard.\nSince the forced debate of no debate in the Brentwood Council Chamber on 26th November, many members of the local authority remain unconvinced by the position being taken by the current council administration with regard to the expiry date of the deal relating to the proposed William Hunter Way development.\nThe William Hunter Way scheme has become a protracted farce having been first agreed by majority of members back in June 2007. Over five years later and nearly four years subsequent to planning approval being granted, the project has stalled.\nThe council's administration has categorically failed to deliver on its promise to provide a cinema for Brentwood residents.\nAs a consequence, the developer has now explained to the council that they wish to renegotiate the financial deal so that it better suits them in the current economic climate. That is inevitably likely to be to the detriment of Brentwood's council tax payers. We as undersigned view this as unacceptable.\nWithin the original deal is a 'long stop date' which allows for either council or developer, Stockland Limited, to walk away from the deal without liability to one another.\nThe 2007 documentation, recently retrieved from the archives at the request of the concerned members below, specifically states that the agreement between the parties ends on December 6th 2010. However, this was extended by 12 months at a meeting of full council in October 2011. This, at the request of the administration whom stated at the time that construction would, at last, begin 'by mid 2012'. As is plain to everyone, there remains a distinct lack of any construction activity at the proposed site.\nThere is an additional proviso that concedes a further 12 months extension in the event that certain land transfer issues have not been met. Hence the actual longstop date now becomes December 6th 2012 as those issues still remain unresolved.\nThe legal deed of variation that amends and extends the 2007 Development Agreement, further to the October 2011 resolution, has now been scrutinised by the undersigned members. But only after having to cajole the council into allowing us to view the paperwork in a private meeting under supervision from the council's officers. This is on the back of repeated refusals to provide any other information to councillors on this subject and the scandalous FOI responses that now comprise around 500 blank, redacted pages and as widely reported in the national press and broadcast media.\nTo members' surprise and disdain, the deed of variation provides for an extension to the principle 2010 long stop date of 24 months, not the 12 months that councillors agreed and that is indisputably minuted as such in the council's records. (October 19th 2011 full council minute number 288 so refers).\nHowever, the council still insists on arguing that one year is really two years in order to play for even further time. Therefore the council are attempting to state that the longstop date is now December 6th 2013.\nUntil November this year, the council's own formal paperwork noted the longstop date as December 6th 2012. The undersigned council members are unsure as to how the foregoing misrepresentation as described, can possibly hold true.\nTime has run out for the council and its top table. Or at least it does on 7th December.\nThe longstop date of 6th December 2013 that the council now contends, is spurious and entirely disputed. Therefore the undersigned members of the attached letter insist that the council's managing director seek properly independent legal advice via counsel to determine the truth to this particular and important aspect of the continuing debacle.\nOnce the long stop date can be determined as just a few days hence, the members named in this letter seek to lobby the Conservative administration to do what should have been done a long time ago and that is to go out to competitive tender in respect of this proposed scheme so as to ensure the absolute best value for the tax payer rather than just the most 'convenient' deal for the select few within Brentwood Council's leadership.\nThe letter, below, is signed by all eight Liberal Demcrat councillors, two Conservative councilors, the Labour group and the independent councillor:\nTo: Ms Alison Crowe, Managing Director, Brentwood Borough Council, Town Hall. Ingrave Road, Brentwood CM15 8AY\n1st December 2012\nDear Alison\nFurther to the extraordinary council meeting of the 26th November, it appears that there is still disagreement between some members of the authority and the administration and officers with regard to the interpretation that is now, suddenly, being advanced in respect of the correct longstop date within the 2007 Development Agreement and as extended by the October 2011 council resolution.\nWe are aware that the council conceded in various items of documentation that the correct date is December 6th 2012. Subsequent to this, the agreement provides for council and developer to 'walk away' without liability to one another.\nThe arithmetic as far as we can see is straightforward. The original longstop date as laid down within the Development Agreement is set as three years from the date of signing of the Development Agreement.\nThis would necessitate that, given that signature was effected in December 2007, the natural long stop date is December 2010.\nA caveat within the Development Agreement allows for the long stop date to slip by 12 months if the land transfers have not been concluded in respect of the Barclays and Sainsburys involvements. At the time of the expiry of the three year anniversary as above, this as now, had not taken place and therefore it follows that the caveat was exercised at that point. The new, extended long stop date thus became December 2011.\nThis holds true on the further basis that the resolution to extend was made in anticipation of this in October 2011.\nAt the October 2011 meeting of full council, members agreed to extend the long stop date by a further 12 months. The narrative within the minutes (288 refers) specifically eludes to this action necessitating that '12 months would seem appropriate to take account of this and accommodate the intended start time of mid 2012.'\nFrom this it is further clear that the intended long stop date provided for within the Development Agreement was and is December 2012.\nThere is no further provision for an additional 12 months to be achieved.\nAs a consequence, our belief is that the current contract between this Council and Stockland is null and void from 7th December 2012.\nWe understand that you will dispute this as it is evident that the council's position has altered to one that seeks to provide a further 12 month breathing space and this was demonstrated by the email that was sent by Clive Power to the Brentwood Gazette in error recently and which purported to 'deal with' the question of the altered long stop date internally.\nThe solicitors representing the administration's views will also no doubt continue to say that they interpret that the concluding date is the latter of December 2013.\nIn order to ensure that this particularly significant aspect of the William Hunter Way redevelopment scheme is clarified, we hereby request that this council fund the instruction of independent counsel to provide opinion on this issue. We will wish to be involved with the choosing of the lawyer in question.\nThis will necessitate that counsel see sight of all relevant documentation so relating in order that they are able to properly execute their instructions.\nAlison, we make this request on behalf of the residents that we represent and that have a right to expect their elected councillors to do what is in their best interests and in full knowledge of all of the facts.\nWe do hope that you will ensure that our request is actioned in the spirit in which it is intended and without recourse to submission of formal motions to council and such like.\nYours sincerely\nCllr Barry Aspinell\nCllr Ross Carter\nCllr Karen Chilvers\nCllr Graeme Clark\nCllr Vicky Davies\nCllr David Kendall\nCllr Mike Le Surf\nCllr William Lloyd\nCllr Julie Morrissey\nCllr Phil Mynott\nCllr Russell Quirk\nCllr Roger Keeble\nCllr James Sapwell",

If you want to see change, vote YES TO AV. If you don't vote No. It's as simple as that.\nAt present only 33% of the MPs elected at the last General Election had the support of the majority of the people they were seeking to represent. Here in Brentwood & Ongar Eric Pickles was one of them gaining over 53% of the vote and as the candidate who came second I fully accept that he would have still been the local MP with or without the Alternative Vote.\nPersonally I would like to see greater reform than AV but AV is all we have on offer and it is certainly better than what we have at the moment. If the opportunity is lost on May 5 then the chance to make our voting system fairer in this country could be lost forever.\nWe already use a form of proportional representation in the UK to elect politicians in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland. The London Assembly and the European Parliament. Why should voters electing MPs to Westminster be denied a fairer system? However two thirds of our MPs were elected with less than 50% of the vote. That means many people are represented by an MP that the majority didn't vote for. In my view this is fundamentally undemocratic.\nToo many MPs act as if they have a job for life. They are protected by a cosy voting system that makes it harder for voters to vote them out. That is one of the reasons we had the expenses scandal and corruption that has seen some MP's sent to prison. I believe we need a system where those people who seek to represent us need to aim to gain the support of 50% of their communities. That is what AV the alternative vote will force MPs to do. MPs will need to try and get a majority of votes in their constituencies. They will have to work harder and reach out to all of their communities beyond their core vote.\nWhen you look at who is supporting the NO campaign you start to get a bit concerned. It's not just most Conservatives, old guard Labour but also the BNP and the Communists. Here in Brentwood when the Tories put in a motion against AV for debate at the Town Hall they were seconded by the sole Labour councillor. It seems that AV was a good enough system to elect the Labour leader but not good enough for the people of Brentwood.\nAV is one person one vote. It allows people to express their preferences. Put simply if you go into a café and they don't have your first choice of drink, or your second, but they have your third choice you haven't had three drinks but you've expressed your preferences. Under first past the post you get one preference and if they don't have what you want you get nothing.\nCllr David Kendall\nLiberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate - Brentwood & Ongar 2010 General Election",

We say Brentwood has been in a similar position before. It didn't work then, and it will not work now.\nBrentwood Council has a dozen major projects in the pipeline that involve hundreds of millions of pounds (of our money) and will affect residents for many, many years to come. These projects demand the constant, hands-on attention of our most senior officer. We cannot see how this can be achieved when OUR Chief Executive will be dedicating half his time attending to the requirements of another authority! Not only that, but the input of several other senior officers from Brentwood Council will be reduced as they support the Chief Executive in his joint role.\nWe have not been approached, as a Council, to formally discuss this before the public announcement had been made. The arrogance of our Conservatives knows no bounds!\nLinks with other Councils also continue to gather pace, as proposed by our Tory Leader. Our membership of ASELA (The Association of South Essex Local Authorities), we are told, promises a pot of gold through the opportunity of drawing down hundreds of millions of pounds from the Government to spend on vital infrastructure projects. Sadly, Brentwood residents have been little informed of the activities of ASELA, that our Leader, Cllr Hossack, now holds the heady position as Chair of that Association, or even how this magical pot of funding would produce specific benefits to our borough. We had been promised full transparency surrounding the aims and objectives of the Association, but aside of one small article hidden deep within ASELA's website, little has been done to promote information sharing on their current priority - the creation of a 'governance structure' incorporating all six member authorities (Thurrock, Basildon, Southend on Sea, Castle Point, Rochford and Brentwood) which would see the transfer of decision making powers from local authorities handed over to a newly created centralised function. In other words, the voice of local councillors representing you, as local residents, would no longer be heard and those decisions relating to the very projects so vital in sustaining the infrastructure needs of Brentwood being made from an office desk located in Basildon, Thurrock, or perhaps even Rochford!\nIs it any wonder that residents lose confidence in our Tory administration when assurances are offered that there are absolutely no intentions for Brentwood to merge its services with other local authorities yet hidden in the Minutes of the Full Council meeting held on Wednesday 16th September, 2020 sits a Motion proposed by our Leader and duly supported by his Tory membership, stating \"This council recognises at some point Brentwood will likely sit under a Unitary Authority, with an overarching Combined Authority\". Even more galling is that this Motion did not allow for any debate before being voted on. Now that is NOT democracy in action for you!\nWe tried to warn the residents of Brentwood of these moves along with what we deemed as dodgy deals in literature and on social media platforms prior to the last election. There was an opportunity to oust the Conservatives from their position of power but obviously, we didn't succeed in getting our message across and residents believed the lies they were being told by the Conservatives, both nationally and locally. Yes, there is another opportunity next May but who knows what mayhem and destruction they will put in place, irrevocably, before then?\nFor the record, the Liberal Democrats believe that Brentwood is big enough to deliver its services as a stand-alone authority and small enough to care for its residents in a meaningful way, not just platitudes and broken promises, and we can assure you that on the 28th July, 2021 at the Full Council meeting in Brentwood we will be making our voices and opposition to the Chief Executive arrangements heard.",

In year 3 and above, the government has set stringent conditions on family income for children receiving free school meals.\nCurrently in Essex, just 15,436 (18.9%) of primary school children in year 3 and above receive free school meals. In government, the Liberal Democrats would ensure 100% of primary school children receive free school meals.\nThe party’s plan also includes an immediate extension of free school meals to all 900,000 children living in poverty who currently miss out across both primary and secondary school.\nAnalysis by PWC found that every £1 spent on free school meals for the poorest children generates £1.38 in health and earnings benefits, including improvements to children’s health, education and future working life opportunities.\nThe new policy will make the Liberal Democrats the most ambitious party on free school meals.\nThe manifesto pledge would be funded by a 4% levy on the share buybacks of FTSE 100 listed corporations, similar to the excise tax on buybacks implemented by President Biden in the US, which could raise around £1.4bn a year.\nShare buybacks occur when companies use profits to inflate their own share price, a practice which critics have warned can come at the expense of productive investment in the economy.\nThe sectors using share buybacks the most are oil and gas giants, banks and large corporations that own a number of food and consumer goods brands. This suggests the practice is being driven by companies profiting from soaring prices during the cost of living crisis.\nLiberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate for Brentwood & Ongar, David Kendall said:\n“Across Essex, there are too many children expected to learn on empty stomachs with no guarantee of a hot meal when they get home.\n“Conservative MPs should hang their heads in shame at a legacy of children going hungry in the worst cost of living crisis in a generation.\n“It is time for change. Every vote for the Liberal Democrats in Brentwood & Ongar is a vote for a local champion who will fight for the wellbeing of children and their futures.\n“I am proud the Liberal Democrats have the most ambitious plan for free school meals of any party, which would save parents money and transform the future for millions of children.”",

It's what makes the adrenalin rush of the win so exhilarating. Yet, many of us like a flutter whether it's buying a National Lottery ticket, investing in shares or a bet on the date of the next General Election!\nThere's not necessarily a link between gaming and gambling, as there are many different routes in to the serious 'problem gambling' that's estimated to affect 430,000 people in the UK and online lure affects all ages. If you are predisposed to an addictive personality an occasional wager probably won't suffice.\nTo add some robust, expert information, last year the Gambling Commission released a report that showed, from 2012 to 2015, problem gambling increased. However, it isn't online gambling causing concern, but fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), that allow betting shop customers to spend up to £100 every 20 seconds.\nBut, what also became apparent is that although only 4% of people gamble online in the UK, almost 35% of these are \"at risk gamblers\" and those account for a further 2 million. So, although problem gambling rose by just 0.2% of the population to 0.8%, there could be an alarming rise in the pipeline. But, right now, things seem stable.\nOn the issue of FOBTs, The Association of British Bookmakers stated that, \"seeking to ban a single gambling product will simply lead to the shifting of problem gamblers to other areas rather than addressing the root cause of the issue,\" and, I believe, the same is true of the betting shop v. online gambling argument as well as the supposed link from gaming.\nThis is, in the context of the UK population, a small problem but it doesn't feel that way if someone you know is sufferng it because, as yet, there's no solution to addiction.",

In Brentwood North, the three of us (Ross Carter, Philip Mynott and I) share the workload as a team, and this is an issue I am dealing with. I first met with Mr Davis in May last year, and I agreed with him that this is an issue. As such I submitted a question to Essex County Council and last July ECC's Highways liasion officer offered a solution to the problem.\n\"Mr Davis disagreed with this proposal and suggested the parking bay removed entirely, but after discussions with other local residents I was told that this was not what they wanted to see so I asked Mr Davis whether he wanted to suggest any other proposals for ECC to investigate, but I was told this was the one he wanted to be implemented. As a result of further conversations with local residents concerned about the lack of parking already in the area, and discussions with colleagues, I approached SEPP (South Essex Parking Partnership) the organisation set up when the Brentwood Tories decided Brentwood didn't need it's own parking services any more, to ask that ECC's suggested solution, reccomended by the Highways Officer, be implemented. I chased SEPP for their response and was finally told in late May 2013 that a meeting had been scheduled to discuss this application amongst others and that I would be advised once a decision was made. I was only advised of this decision last week, which was that the cost would be \"£1500 - £2000\" and that these restrictions have been in place since 1999 and there is no evidence to suggest the current parking arrangements have created any safety issues. As a result, they will not be funding any changes. It is worth noting, that since SEPP was introduced, zero schemes in Brentwood have been implemented.\n\"So there you are, its taken 15 months to get nowhere. This is why being a councillor can be so frustrating. Unfortunately, there are long delays in receiving responses to the most simple of enquiries at both Brentwood Borough and Essex County Councils. This is unacceptable and it does reflect badly on us as Councillors as it is taking months for us to be able to do anything for the residents who elected us.

I've spoken to residents who are now at loggerheads with their neighbours over parking issues, others with disabled parents who struggle with access and someone who got a parking ticket whilst they were unloading their dry cleaning outside their flat!\n\"So far, almost £16,000 has been spent on the scheme, just under £1,000 of this on amendments in the first year. I am disappointed that the Conservatives will only consider individual cases, which will cost money each time, rather than review the scheme in its totality.\"",

Her crime? She took an item of urgent business at her committee that led to a vote of \"no confidence in the Conservative Administration\" being won. In no small part, this was because many Tory committee members were not present and no senior Tory was there to defend their poor performance on their key performance indicators.\nActing Leader of the Opposition, Cllr Graeme Clark, refused and backed Karen as Scrutiny Chair. As the news spread, Brentwood First, Labour and the independent councillor all backed Cllr Chilvers as chair, admirably and gallantly refusing to put up an alternative chair, on the basis that she had done nothing to warrant this action and had chaired all meetings fairly and competently.\nThis would leave Cllr Hirst in a difficult position as the council's recently approved constitution says that the chair of the overview and scrutiny committee \"shall be a member of the opposition\" and, therefore, made Cllr Chilvers impossible to remove.\nSo, we have learnt that now, Cllr Hirst is aiming to change the council's constitution to put a Conservative councillor in the role. This would mean a Conservative councillor would scrutinise their own party, a situation forbidden by the current constitution.\nCllr Graeme Clark said:\n\"This is a dangerous move that damages the constitution. Cllr Hirst wants rid of Cllr Chilvers but has realised that the constitution stands in his way. It states that chairs are elected for the entire year unless he or she resigns. So he is now trying to change the constitution itself, without following due process .\n\"This is reminiscent of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" - the animals' initial constitution was that \"All animals are equal\" until power went to the head of Napoleon the Boar and he added \"but some animals are more equal than others.\"\n\"That is exactly what Cllr Hirst plans to do on 23rd October at full council.\"",

The provision of free parking in town centres works on the basis that it would give much needed support to our towns, encouraging a greater level of footfall and help provide a much-needed boost for our beleaguered high streets.\nHowever, we must recognise that over the decades all local Councils have become reliant on the income that car parking generates. It is depressing but car parking income is really a lifeline now for so many Council services.\nIt is a difficult balancing act. In the continuing age of austerity, please don't be fooled by those that would have you believe the period is over, local Councils can ill afford to be cutting a potential revenue stream. This must be balanced alongside the support that we should be giving our towns, which remain key economic drivers of jobs and leisure activities - which is taking on an even greater level of importance as we emerge from lockdown. Of course, we all want to see our high streets vibrant, access to free or perhaps affordable carparking is a key issue in keeping people away from the out of town retail and leisure areas. But we can't ignore the high percentage of much needed revenue that car parking is generating for Councils across the country - revenue invested back into public services.\nWe need a fair system. There are so many models. Periods of free parking before charges kick in, higher charges in peak periods, trying to get the balance right between charges for the daytime and the night-time economy sharing the burden fairly. Your local Liberal Democrats will exam all models to come up with a solution that is right for our local communities. We will continue to push for better public transport options alongside free and secure cycle facilities as we seek to encourage more local journeys to be taken leaving the car at home.",

Certainly an embarrassing development for Brentwood and a move that would be disastrous for local people.\nOn the 16th of the same month last year, the same minister said of the 15 councils, including Brentwood, against which he had just started the formal process of central government intervention: \"Deadlines have been missed, promises have been broken, progress has been unacceptably slow. No plan means no certainty for local people. It means piecemeal speculative development with no strategic direction, building on sites simply because they are there rather than because homes are needed on them. It means no coherent effort to invest in infrastructure. It means developers building the homes they want to sell rather than the homes communities actually need\".\nIn fact, the Conservatives at national level have a catalogue of failures and ill-considered policies of their own (principally a catastrophic lack of any meaningful national planning strategy), which have become the main reason for the country being in the mess it is at present as regards Planning, the threat to the Green Belt and the desperate shortage of affordable housing.\nNevertheless, each of the specific accusations that the Minister levelled at the 15 councils in November last year is indeed true of Brentwood council under the Tories, and their planning failures locally. As you might expect, they are also all points that have previously been made by the Lib Dems as the borough's main opposition group, points which have been shockingly and repeatedly ignored by local Conservatives. In Sajid Javid's own words, councils including Brentwood have, \"by failing to plan... failed the people they are meant to serve\".\nA copy of the letter can be seen via the following link: http://www.brentwood.gov.uk/pdf/17012018161153000000.pdf\nSo the local council has acted and now everything is going to be OK?\nNo, no, no - see what Essex County Council have to say below.\nAs things currently stand the Brentwood Borough council has just undertaken a Regulation 18 consultation on the Draft Plan, and is proposing to complete its final Regulation 19 consultation, and send the final plan off to the planning Inspectorate, before the end of the year. But there is a duty to co-operate with Essex County Council on the development of the Local Plan due to the strategic cross boundary matters that will affect both authorities. And now Essex County Council have also been scathing on Brentwood Council's efforts, as can be seen from the formal response to Brentwood's consultation in which they withhold support for Brentwood Conservatives' Draft Local Plan: https://cmis.essexcc.gov.uk/essexcmis5/Decisions/tabid/78/ctl/ViewCMIS_DecisionDetails/mid/422/Id/7437/Default.aspx\nThe link above provides the detail on concerns and is there for all to see - the document is 44 pages long. We summarise below.\nEssex County Council has highlighted the need for the plan to be supported with an evidence base and that all reasonable alternatives have been considered. At a high level the broad areas of concerns and unanswered questions are:\nSpatial Strategy\n- how the A127 Corridor provides more opportunities for growth than the A12 Corridor,\n- identification of any cross border implications of the spatial strategy given\n- ECC's role as highway, education, minerals and waste authority, identification of what infrastructure is necessary to deliver the spatial strategy, strategic and individual site allocations\nHousing\n- demonstrate that level of growth can be accommodated by the existing and new social and physical infrastructure\n- how Independent Living programme is to be delivered\n- joint working with ECC and partner local authorities to identify and deliver\nEconomic Growth\n- additional evidence required regarding the impact of the significant employment land allocation at Brentwood Enterprise Park on the strategic junction\n- local road network, and necessary mitigation measures, including sustainable transport measures given the location is not favourable to sustainable travel\nHighways -\n- joint working should be established between all the relevant partners to identify necessary mitigation at relevant junctions\n- to consider the cumulative impact of growth within the borough, and to consider the wider planned growth on the local and strategic route network;\nEducation -\n- continued work required by BBC with ECC to ensure education needs are appropriately and adequately assessed as the new Local Plan continues\n- further assessment of potential delivery and resource requirements for accommodating anticipated pupil growth to inform pre-submission plan and Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP)\n- consider potential cross-boundary issues with Basildon arising from Dunton Hills Garden Village (DHGV),\n- early years and childcare requirements should be included.\nEssex also points out that most other Essex boroughs have taken a whole year to get from their Regulation 18 to their Regulation 19 consultations, whereas Brentwood is trying to do so in a couple of months and they have no track record of delivering anything on time!!!\nIt amounts to a significant list of flaws.\nThe current administration's efforts to put in place a robust Local Plan have been farcical. The process is late to the point of central government threatening to take over - but when the Lib Dems proposed the allocation of further resources to complete the plan to the timetable given, in December 2017, Brentwood's Conservative councillors voted this down!!! This was despite the meeting's agenda admitting that internal resources - currently dedicated to essential work on behalf of the borough's residents - would have to be shifted from this work to achieve the deadline.\nAnd again this was despite the repeated failure to finish Local Plan tasks by the administration's own timetable throughout 2017. Meanwhile the work that has been completed pays far too little and attention to the needs of current or future residents, and the huge problems to be solved. It can't even gain the support of the County Council who, rightly, point out numerous shortcomings.\nWe have to be very grateful for the intervention of the County Council - in that we conclude that it will force a review of certain areas. But it shouldn't come to this. The timeframes for producing a Local Plan have been sufficient, but the Conservatives, who have been in power for 12 years since 2005, have now made three separate attempts at a \"Final\" consultation, beginning as long ago as 2013.\nThe Lib Dems pointed out that the 2016 attempt suddenly included a group of large, new, ill-thought-out sites, proposed without any very noticeable rhyme or reason, and certainly with insufficient evidence to back them up. This argument was ignored - until the Council's legal advisors later made some almost identical points about further work that needed to be done: advice that resulted in the need being accepted for a third \"Final\" consultation this year.\nNo Council should be in this position. All areas of the country will need new homes, but in Brentwood the Tory administration are failing to find sensible ways of providing them, and are selling residents short. Developments are continually being proposed at the expense of vital infrastructure (for example the William Hunter Way car park), or without any explanations as to how the necessary infrastructure (such as schools, upgraded highway network etc.) might be provided.\nIn fact there are serious questions as to whether it is possible to provide the necessary infrastructure, given the limitations on space, of resources, or the existing built environment - but instead of starting to examine this crucial, basic and fundamental question, nothing is happening.\nExamples of this are the numerous proposed developments along the Chelmsford Road in Shenfield, or those in central Brentwood whose traffic would end up on Ongar Road. In both areas multiple large sites have been proposed without sufficient thought for their impact on the numerous junctions, like Wilsons Corner, that are already at capacity.\nFurthermore, where main roads can no longer absorb more traffic, local drivers are already being forced to turn side roads (only ever designed for residential traffic), into rat runs, increasing the dangers to all pedestrians, and the threat to health from exhaust pollution in more and more areas. And yet there is still no meaningful acknowledgement of this spreading problem, let alone any idea as to how to solve it.\nLocally as well as nationally, the Conservatives have proved themselves to not to be up to this particular task. It's time for a change. Brentwood Liberal Democrats would deliver to residents a properly thought through proposal. We would work closely with all bodies with whom there is a duty to co-operate to put in place a workable plan that acknowledges that housing must be affordable, and come with the requisite investment in infrastructure.\nHave your say, and help us do what can be done to save our area by voting Lib Dem on May 3rd.\nIn addition, a link to the current plan is attached.

Given the wear and tear of major construction happening, if anything the station and its surrounds are looking worse then it has over any point of the last 19 years that I have been using the station.\nLast month I wrote about the case of Ella Kissi-Debrah and the fact that a South London coroner's court was holding an inquest into the death of the nine-year-old. As a reminder this was a potential landmark legal case, a coroner was being asked to rule that air pollution caused the death from an acute asthma attack. This finding would make legal history. It has never been identified as a cause of death before in the UK and this is thought to be the first case of its kind in the world. Lewisham Council, the mayor of London and government gave evidence about their knowledge of the levels of toxic air around where Ella lived, the health impacts and what was being done to reduce the pollution. Prior to the inquest It had been decided that article 2 - the right to life - of the Human Rights Act, which scrutinises the role of public bodies in a person's death, apply to the hearing."
